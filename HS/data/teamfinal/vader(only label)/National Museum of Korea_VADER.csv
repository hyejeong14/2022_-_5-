256,A large well organised museum that was worth visiting Lots of intersting items to see though I would say there was a bit too much focus on pottery Due to another appointment I only had one and a half hours to look round which I managed I would say though that two to three hours would be better Free entry Easy to get to,Positive
257,This place is massive the first floor has items relevant to Korean history but upper floors are mostly pottery If you go with young kids youll finish up the first floor and dont bother with upper floors unless you are into artpottery  There is also a childrens museum but it requires a reservations so plan ahead we did not  The museum is located near a subway stop but be prepared to walk about a quarter mile,Positive
258,This museum is well laid out and it is nice There is a billion ceramics on display and this museum is mostly just ceramics,Positive
259,very impressive it shows the 5000 year old korean history with various subjects so sad that i didnt have enough time to see special exhibitions,Positive
260,One of the most spectacular museums I have ever seen You could easily spend a day there and still only see a fraction of what is there,Positive
261,Really enjoyed the museum There was a lot to see and they had some great collections from all over the world,Positive
262,As beautiful as its educational Everything is written in various languages so no worries if you cant speak Korean  Make sure you know what you can and cant bring in I had totally forgotten that my keychain is a Swiss army knife They have lockers but when the museum is packed its pretty hard to find one,Positive
263,Its a beautiful place and a wonderful history presented unfortunate due to construction a lot not visible but just the clock they have hanging already worth going Just get some who can translate for you the Korean as the English translation is not correct ;,Positive
264,The National Museum in Korea is a great place to hang out and learn about Korean history and culture It offers a great escape from the weather and its FREE  Your visit can take 24 hours depending on how much you stop and read Great English translations help foreigners enjoy the experience  Things to know they only allow a limited  inside due to COVID During off peak times there is no wait but there may be a queue doing tourist season Trying making ticket reservations early you may have better luck than me navigating the website  Small cafe with drinks and snacks are located on the bottom floor next to the big gift shop Wear good shoes,Positive
265,This is a breathtaking museum I have a passion for Asian art and this place is perfect for me to dive in the rich Asian culture,Positive
266,This comprehensive museum is massive and well organized I really appreciated the replicas of certain pieces that persons who are blind or low vision and feel and see Thoughtfully arranged and maintained museum which may need two visits to take in,Positive
267,Definitely visit if you have time Great war relics and photo ops especially outside Or do what we did and pick a tour that ends there with enough time to see it,Positive
268,Room after room after room of displays both beautiful art and functional items As you see each room you are transported through Koreas history and advancements The building and the displays are well constructed and informative Highly recommended,Positive
269,Its easy to understand why this museum is one of the top visited museums in the world The exhibits immerse visitors into the arts of the entire history of this country Additional exhibits show the arts of the rest of Asia These exhibits are newly installed and are very engaging The gift shop is one of the best places to buy good quality gifts for friends or yourself A variety of restaurants and coffee shops are also found on site,Positive
270,This museum is fantastic I was very impressed by how rich and wellorganized the museum is The staff is wonderful There are some robots that guide you and explain some of the most important treasures The pieces are welllabelled The museum is very wellcurated There are many highlights including the large pagoda in the first floor the Sila jewellery the pictorial work of the old tombs the Buddha sculptures the celadon the porcelain everything The museum is free and it opens for long hours We arrived in the afternoon We stayed there for only 2 hours The museum deserves at least halfday I have to go back We also walked around the museum It has a sculpture garden and a beautiful lake with a pagoda The museum architecture is just special Of interest to see the sunset through the building is a memorable experience There were very few visitors It is a relaxing museum  It is very easy to find You take the metro and walk a few meters from the station The hallway that connects the metro with the museum is very interesting,Positive
271,I think its awesome when a Museum offers free admission especially to International travelers who can then learn all about a Countrys Culture My husband son and I spent a week in Seoul our very first trip to South Korea and visited the National Museum of Korea on our second day  Its a vast building and one of the largest museums in Asia We took the MRT to get there and it was a nice walk from the MRT station to the Museum The Museum offers one hour free English language tours which we took Our Guide was very friendly and personable and spoke English very well There are also maps of the Museum available in English and they also detail the top sights if you have a limited amount of time to spend  I was fascinated most by the Gold Crowns and Caps so delicate and ornate and so different from say English Crowns  The Museum houses many many of Koreans National Treasures and its really awe inspiring to get to see them and learn South Koreas history  You could spend a couple of days going through here no problem plus there is another Museum on the grounds as well that is devoted to the Korean Language the National Hangeul Museum  There is a large Food court area within in you get peckish and it serves really lovely meals  This is a great spot to visit if youre in Seoul Go,Positive
272,It helps if you read up on the basics of Korean history before you visit the museum because its a complicated story of multiple competing kingdoms rising and falling while simultaneously trying to fend off the Japanese and invaders from China Fortunately the museum explains this history in a series of wall boards in Korean and English the exhibits cover everything from royal jewels to everyday life; something for everybody,Positive
273,First of all the museum has 3 conveniently located Metro lines beneath its structure which will literally commute to and from anywhere within Seoul The architecture as you will see in my pictures is superb and massive very clean in the lines and overall well thought through and exquisitely designed  The day we went there was no entry fee so this was very convenient Although overall the cultural activities in Seoul are not very expensive Some 3000 KW equivalent to some 3 US   Inside the spaces are big and spacious divided in several rooms on C shapes to be covered Meaning when you enter a room on the left and make a full square C you will end up exiting the room on the far right so this is very convenient cause the is no wrong or right in how to approach the rooms it just flows and you cover great territory without even noticing  Some of the rooms are divided with names such as Ornaments and Art Gojoseon and Han China Tombs Guardians and Deities Also will be divided by different eras and dynasties  A room that did catch my attention and curiosity was the Furniture Room where all the furniture was divided in Male and Female Furniture You can see really here the differences in colors lines engravings and depictions on furniture that separates exquisitely both genders with style  Finally there is a coffee shop and a Gift shop conveniently located at the last floor where you are suppose to finish We do recommend this to everyone and definitely we had some 3 hours of pure cultural and informative fun,Positive
274,one of the best museums in Seoul Very easy to find get off at Ichon Subway stop on the blue line three stops from Seoul Station the exhibits are constantly changing and they occasionally have international exhibits  I saw the hermitage exhibit and the Muesum dOlreans Paris museum very resasonable fees,Positive
275,We went here by their hop in and hop off bus The view is amazing and great You will learn alot from their culture and history,Positive
276,This museum is worth a visit both for the amazing building and the collections The building is grandiose and the exhibition rooms are well designed Everything is translated into English making it easy to navigate The collections are remarkable with the main focus being on Korean art from prehistorical times to early modern history Easy access by metro Allow enough time to visit the many interesting rooms,Positive
277,This museum is a must visit if you are a history nerd or youre just interested in learning about our past and ancestors It is not only about Korea as the 3rd floor is the world history section where if includes historical facts and artifacts from India rest of Asia Egypt and Japan Be prepared to walk a lot Theres water dispenser at every level so you can bring your bottle for refill,Positive
278,Its close by all the palace and ancient village of Bukchon Hanok  Best of all its free for all  There is a comprehensive display and exhibits of korean history and culture and how people used to live  There were vivid and creative displays in for of real water fall and walls of Korea painting projected on walls,Positive
279,It is Koreas National museum and its a nice building with a few genuine national treasures but it falls a bit flat It seems too sparse and many of the English descriptions are poorly done or entirely absent It also does not flow well and there were only a few really memorable exhibits The Leeum Samsung museum is much better,Positive
280,We visited to this museum in the morning so we had a chance to catch the English speaking guided tour It was interesting and even outside of the museum there are lots of things to explore,Positive
281,We came here after visiting the Korean War Museum so we were pretty tired and still very jet lagged This is a beautiful museum and I wish we would have taken more time to explore but we were just so exhausted Worth seeing still,Negative
282,This is attached to the National Museum of Korea  didnt realise it was actually two different listings We spent just on 2 hours here combined and didnt even do a tour missed the english guide by 10mins Lots of information and plenty to explore outside,Negative
283,Easy to get to the museum next to Gyeongbokkung museum At the time I visited there was a small number of visitors But the permanent exhibitions were all open The exhibitions were interested and well displayed A good place to visit,Positive
284,In my opinion I would place this museum in a world class category It is a magnificent structure that holds precious artifacts historical documents and all else related to Korean cultural and history This is my second visit to this museum The first visit I attempted to start top down and took the free condense English tour I was not able to complete all floors and now several years later I have returned and decided to start from the first level Needless to say I reached up to the 3rd floor level before I ran out of steam Even if you rented a translation device it would still take you a good half of a day if not more to cover all floors Also they have beautiful grounds to explore and that too have a lot of artifacts around the building There is a good restaurant near the top level to take a break So if you are into cultural and history this is definitely a museum not to be missed Better to break up your visit to two trips if you had the time Oh yes there are some neat food trucks that you could eat just before you climb the stairway towards the museum local,Positive
285,The National Museum of Korea is located in a park not far from Yongsan Station During my stay the museum was very quiet with a small number of visitors Some space was closed for preparation of a themed exposition the permanent exhibition was all open It is worth spending some hours here The Museum shop has a nice collection of items at different price levels,Positive
286,I had one day off and went to the amazing National Korean Museum  a very very large building which is similar to Musee dOrsay in Paris a lot of space There I had a guide it seems a lecturer from a university he had a really broad knowledge Okay his English needed improvement but the explanation he gave about Korean history was incredible Moreover he knows a lot of culture  The Subway or Metro to the Museum is well organized In the hotel they explained me how it works and with this information I bought a ticket and went into Korea underground Stations are indicated in Korean and English so it helps otherwise Korean people are very open and friendly to show you the way  Do not throw your ticket away because at the end you get a refund of \xe2\x82\xac 050  very sustainable,Positive
287,This museum is adjacent to the Gyeongbokung Palace so its very convenient to visit Theres a cafe in the basement for light refreshments A comprehensive display of the Joseon Dynasty that lasted for 5 centuries A pleasant way to spend an afternoon,Positive
288,Wonderful place to visit Worthwhile experience Very well explained exhibits and easy to follow explanations,Positive
289,Sadly the app crashed and lost my review  good for kids  Timed free entry for the kids museum geared for 7  under but no age limit  free entry to the permanent exhibit  plenty of parking Recommend,Positive
290,This national museum has an interesting selection of exhibits and isnt so big that you get gallery fatigue when youre only halfway through The restaurant is good for traditional Korean food at a reasonable price and I found the gifts in the museum shop were attractive and very reasonably priced,Positive
291,You can divide museums into great and not great The great museums then can be divided into worth a return visit and not worth one The National Museum of Korea is a great museum that is unquestionably worth return visits  First the architecture a large building divided into smaller units ie childrens museum library exhibition hall The exhibition hall has both permanent and special exhibitions I only had time almost three hours to see the permanent exhibitions on the third and second floors but didnt see the first floor or the special exhibition Regretfully I left my visit to this museum for my last day in Seoul  The exhibitions themselves are of the highest quality using among others collections that were donated or bequeathed to the museum  Physically the exhibition halls are impressive massively large with high ceilings The explanatory text is interesting and fully translated to English  There are a few places to eat I can only comment on the tea room on the third floor where I had an amazingly good cup of tea There is also an extensive museum shop which is itself impressive I left some money there and would have left much more had I lived in Korea and not had to take fragile things on several flights,Positive
292,The main building offerred free admission but dont miss special exhibitions at the library building with extra fee which was worth the visit I felt obliged as it was great enough to spend some money to support it So I bought some souvenir from the museum shop  Easy to go there just take a train to Ichon Station,Positive
293,We visited the museum while staying in Seoul It is very well laid out and the displays are simply beautiful Amazing that so much history has been preserved and acquired for people to see Was particularly pleased to see so many school groups there,Positive
294,So impressive how the museum is organised  you almost feel how it was like to live in ancient times Need at least a day to do it justice,Positive
295,My wife and I spent a lovely afternoon browsing through both the paid exhibitions The EtruscansRising to Rome and Through the Eyes of Joseon Painters and the first couple of floors of their free exhibitions  The hours just went by as we strolled through the many galleries admiring the exhibitions  During my visit as I was going through the The Etruscans  Rising to Rome exhibition 3 boys were left on pretty much on their own and they were running around the exhibition being a general annoyance A poor female exhibition staff had a hard time trying to stop those 3 imps  This brings me to my one protip If you are bringing your kids and I highly recommend that you do there is even a children museum keep them on a tight leash  Anyhow the museum inside and outside is splendid Unfortunately we didnt have enough time to cover or at least walk through all its exhibitions,Positive
296,This museum has many different Korean artifacts and artworks The first floor focuses on premodern and earlymodern history in Korea though no modern history section The second floor focuses on calligraphy and artworks while the third floor is mostly porcelain pots I would have liked to see more history especially of the modern period but overall the museum has quite a lot of artifacts and is very extensive The museum is free to enter and can be accessed via the Ichon subway stop Worth checking out if you are in Seoul,Positive
297,This museum was amazing the building itself is beautiful and there are many interesting exhibits which helped us to learn more about Korean history Lots of information in English and very useful leaflets guiding visitors to key exhibits,Positive
298,Pur\xc3\xa9 culture learning experience for all of us bisedes an special exhibition from europe estrucos Was there,Positive
299,If you have time you should go to the museum You can walk through the history of Korea and depending on whats being shown travelling items can be seen as well They had the landscape painting exhibit when we went They were also showing the Etruscan stuff  which we bypassed New modern museum layout of which reminded me of DOrsay It also has a food court to keep you from wandering off too far in search of food Food actually passable as good and are reasonably priced Museum items was well worth the time spent and is highly recommended,Positive
300,The museum is quite big and have many interesting exhibitions Recommended for a family trip or for a rainy day,Positive
301,A great place for museum lovers or those with a genuine interest in Korean history The museum is housed in an imposing building surrounded by beautiful grounds Entry is free to the permanent exhibitions We were fortunate to arrive on a day where there was free entry to the visiting special Etruscan exhibition Very easy to get to via the Metro Ichon station Line 4 exit 2 has a special pathway to the Museum itself Well worth a visit you could spend hours here,Positive
302,Spent 45 hours here on a rainy day on my most recent trip to Seoul and still did not cover the entire museum Its a beautiful space and highly recommend spending a half day or more if you can exploring The grounds around the museum are beautiful as well wish it had not been raining so I couldve spent more time exploring the complex around the museum,Positive
303,Great museum and best of all its free Extensive Asian collection They even have little robots for help if needed Worth a day no matter the weather,Positive
304,Really impressive building with a wonderful and accessible collection Could spend a few hours or days there,Positive
305,Well organized nice exhibition in a vibrant building It is not ovecrowded even on a rainy day Free entry is a plus,Positive
306,Easy to access from metro line 4 Ichon station exit 2 or bus 502 or 400 this museum is well worth the visit General entry is free MTuThF 10001800 WedSat 10002100 SunHolidays 10001900  closed Jan 1 Seollal and Chuseok and they offer guided tours in Korean Japanese Chinese and English throughout the day Exhibitions are displayed over three floors  a variety of galleries  prehistoric works celadon an impressive Iron Buddha  just amazing works Worth a quick visit if that is all you have time for or one could spend hours just admiring the works There is a nice gift shop several options for tea or meals and a childrens museum on site did not visit I would highly recommend a visit to this amazing museum  can be combined with a visit to the National Hangeul museum and Yongsan park for a short stroll outside Ichon is becoming a more developed neighborhood with plenty of places to eat or get coffee and about 12 a kilometer from the metro stop to the Hangang Riverside Park and paved trail that runs seemingly endlessly along the Han,Positive
307,Im truly surprised by the number of museums and galleries in Seoul The National Museum of Korea is a gem and a must see The building is large an spacious with exhibited being well laid out Ive only managed to see less than 30 before it closed I will be back again I loved how they present history and culture Korea whilst smaller than China is in her own right a very sophisticated country and unique in many ways The gift shop is the best and biggest Ive seen for a museum,Positive
308,We needed more time to take in all the history and artifacts this museum has to offer We were not given long enough to take it all in but learned a lot in the time we hadDefinitely worth a visit,Positive
309,You could probably spend an entire day here if not more This is one of the biggest museums Ive ever visited but its beautiful Its very well curated as well Keep in mind that unless Korean and Asian history is something of interest to you this may not be your thing As interesting as it is it may be difficult follow along and grasp all the history thats being thrown at you  Nevertheless if you just want to look at beautifully preserved artifacts then this place is perfect for you I remember walking into one room with a VAST collection of Buddha and Bodhisattva statues I believe mostly from Korea and they were just breathtaking Absolutely enormous with fine detail and descriptions nearby,Positive
310,nice museum with interesting historical exhibits nice to visit and learn about the past of this culture but also because of the cultural open air events,Positive
311,If like myself you are not a great lover of large rambling 19th Century Museums crammed with thousands of artefacts over umpteen floors and galleries  this is one for you Its modern its light its airy and is just one long building with just 3 levels with a very constrained number of exhibits covering some quite precise subject areas Entrance to the main collection is free A little word of warning in busy times the galleries are quite manageable but dont be tempted to try the food hall,Negative
312,It was a muggy day when we visited as its been raining on and off  As part of the tour we went through it within an hour Could easily spend half a day if youre into history and artifacts,Positive
313,If you are into understanding and experiencing the evolution of Art calligraphy and sculpting this is a must do If not youd better skip it Very detailed collections of multiple eras within the Korean geography Surprisingly well kept Especially the calligraphy from stone carving over papyrus to the first printed books The museum souvenir store is a real gem,Positive
314,This museum is big and I mean big There is so much to see within its walls that make sure you reserve more than one hour if you really want to focus on all of it Sadly as in every museum in Korea Korean nationalism has embellished some of the history and left the nasty parts out,Negative
315,We love to visit National Museums when we have the opportunity With only 2 days in Seoul we had to choose carefully how to spend our time We are so happy that we began our first day at the National Museum of Korea The displays were nicely presented with narrative in English which gave us insights and information to better understand Korea and the Korean people This large and airy museum includes a 10 story pagoda The directional flow from room to room is logical and easy to follow Our 3 hour visit was fabulous We highly recommend making the time to visit this excellent museum,Positive
316,For history and historical art lovers A huge collection of Korean sculpture furniture calligraphy painting impossible to see all in 1 day,Positive
317,We love to learn about the countries we visit and the museum was a great way to do that It feels wide open and uncluttered and is easy to get around The gardens outside are beautiful and not to be missed We didnt eat here as it seemed expensive like all museums so bring snacks My 12 year old was bored but my two 18 year olds love it Have a great day,Positive
318,There are three great cultures in East Asia Chinese Korean and Japanese For at least the last two millennia Chinese cultural influences radiated out to both Korea and via Korea to Japan Westerners sometimes dismiss Korean art as imitative but thats not true You might as well dismiss Italian Renaissance painting as simply imitative of Flemish or Romanesque architecture as simply imitative of Roman Each of the Far Eastern national arts is unique and excellent But I suspect even those with a strong interest in art and culture are far more familiar with Chinese and Japanese than Korean So in terms of delving into artistic and cultural terra incognita we Westerners would get more bang for the buck in the National Museum of Korea than in either the Imperial Palace Museum in Taipei or the National Museum in Tokyo All three of these museums are overwhelming but Koreas fine arts are the ones most likely to be a terra nova  You could spend a full day at this museum standing in line when the doors open and being ordered out when they close and still not absorb it all I was astonished to see TAs suggested duration as \xe2\x80\x9c2 to 3 hours\xe2\x80\x9d but felt better when I checked and saw their suggested duration for the British Museum was also \xe2\x80\x9c2 to 3 hours\xe2\x80\x9d In fact cheer up curators of the NMK TAs suggested duration for the Louvre is \xe2\x80\x9c 1 hour\xe2\x80\x9d The curatorship of the NMK by the way is as outstanding as its collection which was good news for me I needed all the help I could get Here are just a few things Id recommend you look for  Plug Em and Pot Em We do a lot of odd things to our dead Egyptians mummified them; so did Chileans Zoroastrians put them out for the buzzards to eat; so did Thais long ago Eating them was the norm in New Guinea New Zealand and the Amazon But as you wander through the NMKs collection of Three Kingdoms artifacts 4th5th century CE be on the lookout for some huge red clay pots Baekje honoured their noblest dead by jarring them My mother used to preserve stuff in jars too but it was apples and apricots not ancestors See Burial Jars photo  A Really Old Boat The bestknown boat surviving from antiquity is the Khufu boat which has an entire museum to itself a baseballs throw from the Sphinx in Gaza Its over 4000 years old and remarkably wellpreserved but was built strictly for mortuary purposes and never even got wet The NMKs got a real boat thats twice as old 8000 not 4000 You get to see what little remains of it and a recreation A humble canoe; no Pharaoh would have dreamed of stepping into it but it would be thousands of years later before Pharaohs were even invented Im not sure wed even gotten to antiquity yet when some stoneage Korean carved this canoe Korean fauna back then included cave lions and woolly mammoths I suspect the canoe hit a rock got holed and was abandoned by its owner as a nowworthless piece of junk Little did he know that people would line up and pay good money to see it 8000 years later see Neolithic Canoe photo  Buddhas Explained Naturally the NMK has a large collection of ancient Buddhas Ive mentioned the NMKs outstanding curatorship I particularly commend them here Ive been to national museums in China Japan and every country in Southeast Asia and this is the first museum Ive seen seen that explains each and every mudra Whether theyre giant Buddhas or miniatures all Buddhas do something with their hands Each hand gesture has a specific meaning but if you dont know Buddhist signlanguage you cant read them The NMK provides you with an easy 10minute course on what each one of them means immeasurably improving your understanding and appreciation of what youre seeing After six years of wandering around Asia I knew a few of them but now I know five times more A healing Buddha holds a medicine ball in his left hand and not only heals folks but saves them from calamities in both Pure Land or Theraveda Buddhism the \xe2\x80\x9cgoddess of mercy\xe2\x80\x9d Guanyin does the same and she also holds a bottle of medicine see Healing Buddha A different gesture indicates that the Buddha is dividing his disciples into nine different grades depending on their religious capacity see GradeMaking Buddha The star of the collection however is a pensive Bodhisattva one of the National Treasures of Korea see Pensive Bodhisattva The museums also got a brilliant 5minute video on the building of one of the UNESCO world heritage site Buddhist temples in south Korea broken capstone and all Every NMK video is worth watching  Other National Treasures Korea has an admirable system for identifying its finest cultural treasures Youll find quite a few of them in this museum National Treasure 61 NT 61 is a 12th century dragonshaped celadon ewer see Celadon Dragon; NT 191 is a golden \xe2\x80\x9cantler helmet\xe2\x80\x9d and girdle see Antler and Girdle Other NTs run the gamut from NT86 a towering ceramic pagoda that you cant possibly miss see Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda to NT 89 a belt buckle that you could easily miss but hopefully wont its made of over 50 grams of pure gold thread and granules shaped into a large twisting dragon surrounded by half a dozen smaller ones see Gold Belt Buckle I used to have a belt buckle just like that myself in my dreams Be on the lookout for anything in the museum with an NT designation  I could have spent several days in this museum Spending only one I focused almost entirely on the Korean collections However the museum has important collections from other cultures including Gandhara and Pala Two items that definitely caught my eye were a bronze Greek helmet and a small but ornate Malay basin small because it was used to give newborn babies their first scrub see Greek Helmet and Malay Neonate Basin If youve an interest in Chinese celadon dont miss the the Sinon Shipwreck Collection This notquitehardyenough ancient freighter was headed to Japan in the 1320s ran afoul of a typhoon or faulty navigation and wound up at the bottom of the sea off the coast of Korea 1323 was at the tailend of the Mongol dynasty they went through seven emperors during that decade each one worse that his predecessor but China was still making firstrate china Hence a treasuretrove of Chinese celadon from as far afield as Canton being glazed thousands of pieces were in pristine condition Personally Id rate Sung celadon 1 Tang porcelain 2 and Ming 3 but a shipfull of any Chinese celadon is a treasuretrove indeed with a thousand pieces of metalware as a little something extra see Sinon 1 Sinon 2 Sinon 3 and Sinon 4 photos  If you want to take a break the museum has both a excellent teahouse and a restaurant Be aware that if you order anything with \xe2\x80\x9cspicy\xe2\x80\x9d in its name such as \xe2\x80\x9cspicy beef soup with black tigers paw mushrooms\xe2\x80\x9d it may be hotterthanHades spicy even by South Louisiana Cajun standards see Spicy photo Also note that the grounds around the museum are wellworth a stroll with bridges and pavilions gardens and carp ponds see Museum Gardens photo  As with any other major world museum what you bring to it will reflect what you take away from it If you can do the Louvre in under an hour 2 or 3 hours here will certainly suffice If youve got young children the odds are that that hall after hall of glazed porcelain will make their eyes glaze over But for visitors with a real interest in Asian culture and art Id recommend getting there when the doors open and sticking to it until they close But then Id recommend spending a whole day at the Louvre too,Positive
319,Nice place to explore This large area with many historical things is great for knowing better korean history,Positive
320,We had allowed a few hours to look around but you could easily spend a day in here if you wanted to take in every exhibit in the permanent exhibition and then the rest of the complex There are three floors in the permanent exhibit and we ended up having to skip the entirety of the third due to time Looking at the guide map there is also a Childrens Museum on the other side of the entrance auditorium so definitely allow more time if youre travelling with younger kids The permanent exhibit is free although there is a charge for the rotating special exhibitions and Childrens Museum  If you are spending a day theres plenty of restaurants and cafes on site We also passed a 7eleven or similar store in the complex The staff at reception spoke some English and there is also a helpful stationary guide robot with information in English  We got a taxi there and back but the museum is also connected to Ichon Station on the subway by an underpass,Positive
321,If you love museums and history this is the place to go to The place is new massive and has a great collection of Korean history There are highlights of the collection as it will probably take you more than a day to go through in detail through the entire collection Highly recommended museum,Positive
322,We always go to the museum of the country we visit and this one was particularly good The layout was amazing and seamless from one period to another The space between exhibits were large so you wont feel crowded at all There were plenty to see and read We arrived 1 hour before closing as we rushed over from another museum So we only did the ground floor and chose the important parts to see The museum is free to enter for all You can download the museum app and use it as an audio guide You need to use your own headphones though as required by the museum,Positive
323,Large interesting exposition A lot of information about the history of Korea the royal dynasties the life of the common people crafts and traditions Highly recommend All national museums in Korea are free,Positive
324,Very interesting museum Tons of information and details Great place to learn more about Korean history I was jet lagged so could not fully enjoy this place But I recommend to plan at least 23 hours to explore In addition there is an amazing space in front of the entrance or rather between the entrances With a beautiful view to Namsan sp See the photo,Positive
325,Im not sure if its free for everyone but it was free for us as part of the tour and it was a decent hour or so we spent in there Very interesting to learn about the creation of the Korean writing system and more about Korean history that I didnt know Useful going into my PhD in East Asian Studies,Positive
326,If time allows only one museum choose this one Its free and hours vary depending on the day of the week Look online at the official website Skip the guided tour English hard to understand and 1 hour spent on 10 items Allow 3 hours plus time for any special exhibits Download the app and bring your earphones Well organized so numbered exhibits correspond to numbers on the app Exhibits in English so easy to follow Enjoy,Positive
327,Building itself is impressive Exhibition boring and way too large feels like you have seen these same green vases so many time Seems to be popular amoung school groups Children running around and acoustics make place noisy ,Positive
328,Free and worth visiting with Korean Dynasties and culturesI luv the small cafeteria inside very clean and polite staffs,Positive
329,Beautiful place tastefully designed to remember and educate It was quite emotional but very deserving Learn and never forget,Positive
330,A great insight into Korean history It has a wonderful display of ceramics We had lunch at the restaurant which was delicious A must see place to visit in Seoul,Positive
331,The museum is big and has lots of interesting rooms with history of Korea There is quite a great view of the N Seoul Tower from there and they have shops where you can buy souvenirs related to the antiques that you will see in the museum I went to the museum on the weekend and I didnt have to pay an entrance fee I guess the entrance is free on the weekends You are allowed to take pictures of the different exhibition rooms they have but you are going to be requested to go through an Xray security checkpoint before entering the hall where the exhibition rooms are I highly recommend you to go to this museum if you are interested in the history of Korea and of course if you are willing to spend two to three hours there because the museum is huge,Positive
332,After visting the site of thombs and their contents at the Gyeongju Ancient Tomb Complex we when to the musuem to gain more knowledhe of the Shilla PeopleThe displays wete excellent and had descritions in English Excellent,Positive
333,We have been to this museum on two seperate visits  it is well done and explains th rich history of Korea It is easier to understand the culture with a history lesson from the museum,Positive
334,Sadly the app crashed and lost my review  good for kids  Timed free entry for the kids museum geared for 7  under  traveling Happy inside exhibit was great  Recommend,Positive
335,If you are visiting Seoul there are three places that is must in my opinion Gyeounbokgung palace National Museum of Korea and The War Memorial of Korea are the three The first two will provide visitors with the sense of Korean culture history and the language that is unique to Korea The last will give you an insight into the recent history of the nation that overcame the tragic and catastrophic events that were Japanese occupation liberation and Korean War,Negative
336,It may not be quite as interesting as the War Museum the best free museum in Korea but it does get the silver medal Great way to spend a few hours out of the sun or rain and when the weather is right enjoy the large park outside In fact the park is superb minirivers and waterfalls play area for kids lots of green space and trees  great way to relax Highly recommended a very cheap day out,Positive
337,I went there a few times and I really like it They have a huge collection including lots of porcelain The museum itself is very spacious so be prepared for at least 2 hours of visiting Theres a small park  like right outside the museum And the entrance is free of charge  Sometimes they organize events for foreigners like for eg making korean masks  only that costs extra,Positive
338,Love the exhibits the architecture and facilities at this museum Please allocate ample time for this place and do not skip the park,Positive
339,Visitors to Korea will love the extensive collection of Korean treasures many of which have decent labels in English Something hard to find in Korea As a resident of Korea I love that this museum gets special exhibits like the Golden Man from Kazakhstan last year and that it has a great selection of coffee and tea shops and a beautiful sitting area on the second floor Its a spacious beautiful museum and a worldclass collectionfor free,Positive
340,If you want to learn about Korea and its extraordinary history go to this Museum My family and I loved it Please try the cafe on the ground floorbeautiful,Positive
341,What a beautiful museum and it is located within a short stroll of a subway station Even though I am not well informed as to Asian history and artifacts the museum is definitely worth a stroll  and since admission is free there is little risk for the benefit of expanding ones artistic exposure,Positive
342,Beautiful Museum with excellent displays of Korean Culture and History Admission is free and it can be accessed either through the Palace grounds or a separate entrance Take the time to tour and visit,Positive
343,I love this museum you will learn and appreciate korean culture and history It displayed Other south east asian countries artifacts Free admission Has 3 floors and an indoor activity,Positive
344,We are great fans of museums This being said this Seoul museum is at the top of the pile We usually Is it from the top down  fewer people do the upper ranges and only completed the 2nd and 3rd floors in 3 hours Th displays are well thought Our highlight of a 7 stay in Seoul,Positive
345,Was able to spend two hours here and wished we could have stayed all day Not only are the exhibits fascinating but the building itself is very beautiful The architecture is modern and sleek but not in a brutalist unfriendly way The lighting inside the building was amazing and the fixture are very technologically advanced One of the most beautiful museums I have ever visited There is a restaurant and childrens museum there as well,Positive
346,The National Palace Museum was housed in a massive building and was quite impressive as we walked towards it The opening in the center framed a view of Seoul Tower in the distance  Outside in the sprawling park were various ancient lanterns restaurants a bell and a large pond Inside were three floors of historical artifacts both curated and donated to the museum  We started on the third floor and worked our way down with the hopes of missing the large groups of school age children that arrived the same time as us This worked well for the first hour  The third floor contained a large variety of Buddhist sculptures and various pieces of art from around Asia Half of the second floor was full of donated collections and were a mixture of different eras and countries Not that interesting to us The other half covered the paintings and an amazing two story tall Buddhist scroll Dynasties and even older Korean civilizations were covered in detail on the first floor However as this was a rather large museum we breezed through these displays as we were ready to get outdoors  Overall this museum could be split into a 2 day visit to avoid history overload,Positive
347,Its a 40 minutes ride on the subway south from Insadong including a 10 minute underground walk from the stop to the main entrance The vast building is impressive with great views of the Seoul Tower The collections inside are excellent and well laid out,Positive
348,I took an early morning subway ride to this place knowing that the Museum has an expansive grounds to stroll Arrived 9AM and had a leisurely stroll around Note that there are people jogging and they have small trails winding around pagodas and meditation nooks It was so peaceful without the crowd and by noon it was already hot The museum entrance is free and they have two special exhibits The exhibits costs KW7500 and for people who has not much interest on it I recommend you pass The main museum artifacts are more than enough for a short visit approx 1 hr There is a convenience store open prior to 10AM and I saw two restaurants that were still close when I left the grounds I suggest coming early to avoid bus loads of kids visiting the museum,Positive
349,This is a great museum 1 its free 2 the grounds are beautiful 3 the museum store has very inexpensive and nice museum gifts 4 lockers for your stuff 5 many nice artifacts from Korea and other Asian areas We did not go to any of the special exhibits as we were a bit short on time but we had a great visit,Positive
350,Possitives  N o doubt the museums contemporary architecture is both modern and impressive and is set in very attractive gardens The facilities are very adequate there is free entry and the staff are pleasant and helpful Negative For such a modern national museumBoy it was so tediously boring Old school type of exhibitionjust dated exhibits and artifacts in glass cabinets No interactive fun here or anything to fuel the imagination  I fell asleep on my feet my the second floor I should imagine incredibly boring for children ,Positive
351,The museum is easily accessibly via the Seoul Metro The grounds are beautiful with several restaurants and many places to sit and relax There was no admission charge but there were charges for some special exhibits This is a large museum and is well laid out with exhibits down the side of the main hallway on each floor There is just too much to go into extreme detail but there is coverage of Indian Chinese and Korean history and artifacts; all well presented and explained with many explanations in English for those like myself that had trouble with Hangul My favourite was probably the ancient shipwreck exhibit which showed many artifacts There were several souvenir shops The restaurant Was very good Reasonable price for a museum restaurant; the Bibimap meat and vegetables mixed up with rice was quite tasty definitely worth a visit,Positive
352,It is a bit surprising that there are many artifacts are relating to Buddhism including the multimedia shown how a marvelous shrine was shaped without a nail in ancient time The engineering in their past few hundreds years ago was astonishing It made me feel closed to Asia and proud of them I visited the special exhibition about Five Hundred Arahants The display was breathtaking virtually an exceptional artistic arrangement In that space You felt like you were among them in that comfortable quiet space when the statues all had different expressions unique in each It bestows you the sense of content and serene a surreal feelings is very hard to describe The acoustic arrangement with Arahants statues in other display room just amazing It satisfied you not only the eyes but ears to be exact even mind When I left the room I feel enlightened  After all there are lots to see although quite lots of them purchased in few centuries ago Properly this is one of the reasons why we should visit the National Museum of Korea not to mentioned the well designed building and surrounding,Positive
353,We were not able to enter the museum because we used up all our time playing outside and around the place Although the building shouts CONCRETE the setting is serene with nice pocket spots There were pine trees that dropped lots of miniature pine cones that my little granddaughter enjoyed collecting  this is why we ended up staying outside,Positive
354,Free Large collection of artifacts and free tours If you dont have time or just dont to do a tour download the free app for a self guided tour,Positive
355,We spent about 2 hours at the museum though you can easily spend a lot more time We did not do the audio tour but we did do a guide tour in English that lasted about an hour and highlighted some of the National Treasures in the museum The guide spoke very good English and was very knowledgeable We definitely recommend doing a guided tour if you can arrange to visit when they are available The guided tour like the rest of the museum is free Be sure to save time to explore the beautiful grounds outside the museum as well If you are doing the free guided tour then I would say give yourself 2 hours minimum at the museum though we could have spent more time there if we had more time to spare,Positive
356,An amazing collection or series of collections It is well layed out asy access and all have English desriotions Pick up a guide and headphone set worth it,Positive
357,We were told it is one of the best and had pretty high expectations It was not so systemic as we expected But at the same time it gives some overview of Korean culture and history,Positive
358,The National Museum of Korea has a great amount of exhibits about the korean history Even though the museum is free of charge and offers an app to get english explanations about some of the exhibits on your one cell phone not everything is explained If you are not very familiar with korean history youll easily get bored But the place is worth s visit just because of the beautiful landscape the architecture and the view of the N Seoul Tower from the south,Positive
359,This was a great free way to spend a few hours while in Seoul Easy access from the subway Lot of good information and most descriptions on itemsexhibitions are also in English which was super nice Plenty of places to rest inside and also had food options Overall great place to visit,Positive
360,This is a beautiful place to visit when you come to Korea know more about the culture of this county Nice to visit,Positive
361,From the elegant building itself to the depth of the collections to the attention to guest comfort  this is a world class museum The displays all with English signage provide a sampler of the history and culture of South Korea There are several places to eat both inside the museum and outside but on the museum grounds Each floor has a couple sets of rest rooms and places to sit and rest As for getting there subway access is easy; from the maps I saw I was concerned we might have to walk across a large parking lot to get from the subway to the museum but not so; there is a direct underground tunnel from the subway to the museum entrance plaza; although some walking is involved its comfortable and quiet,Positive
362,When you stay in South Korea you need to visit this museum it is really interesting and you will be satisfied for what you paid,Positive
363,This is a huge museum that tells the story of Korea extremely well It has a wide range of artifacts dating back thousands of years but also extending into the modern era Plan on several hours at the minimum,Positive
364,The place is highly recommended for a must visit if you are in Seoul You can reach here by Metro Figure out your nearest metro station and reach here You may have to walk a bit though,Positive
365,Such a nice spacious museum Lots of artefacts statues some furniture Wish there was more artwork Very clean facilities,Positive
366,This might be one to split into a few visits as its overwhelmingly large Pick a few areas which strike you and dive in then enjoy whats nearby,Positive
367,The museum is in a wonderful modern complex with a huge building housing some artefacts from various ages  Ill be honest I like a museum but this one didnt do it for me I felt they struggled to fill it and what they had was interesting but nothing special,Positive
368,Took advantage of the free English speaking guide She was knowledgeable and interesting but had an extremely soft voice so it was difficult to hear Lovely building and interesting exhibits Easy to get to on the Metro and well worth a visit,Positive
369,The museum with the most heritages in Korea With amazing flower gardens and huge pond its good for a picnic as well as history learning   As everyone knows the entrance is free except special exhibitions  I was surprise to see it opens seven days a week  The varieties of items werent as much as I expected But its still huge  Dont expect much of luxurious and fascinating treasures because former Korean kingdoms have valued something humble On the other hand there are delicate and mysterious mastermade items  The location is quite away from popular touristic areas Its not crowded on weekdays  Exhibition halls are wellmaintained You can watch most items just by moving forward And there are quite enough resting areas  Free lockers coffee shops restaurants etc Souvenir shop is mustvisit There are amazing merchandises  In April there were many maehwaJapanese Apricot flowers blooming in the garden It seemed there were more people outdoors than inside Taking a walk around the building is recommended when its warm  To the east its connected to Hangul Museum and Yongsan Family Park Both are good to visit as well,Positive
370,This museum is really big so be prepared to spend a lot amount of time there especially if youre a museum geek The collection is really massive and quite complete,Positive
371,Even if this imposing museum is filled with exquisite artifacts the unforgettable displays are set up in a way to be able to really appreciate and enjoy them There are lots of benches to reflect upon and the explanations are well written The lockers make it easy to store coats and bags and there are many easily accessible bathrooms,Positive
372,A beautiful and actionpacked place to visit The main collection is wonderful and free The rotating exhibits will charge a fee but they are also firstrate Plenty to do for adults and kids The grounds are also a mustsee,Positive
373,I have never seen such a huge museum before Im not abig fan of museums but this one really is impressive Not only that is big make shure to give it half a day at least but it is also well organized and interesting It has a beautiful lake and garden in front of it and also a restaurant I spent there my last day in Seoul and it was all worth it,Positive
374,This is a flagship museum that offers many aspects of Korean history The museum is located at Yongsan area can be accessed by mRT and stop at Ichon Station Exit 2 walking 150m The museum also has a separate museum for children with fee The rest is free of charge,Positive
375,After a week of touring South Korea I was wondering where I might see some treasures This is the place The museum is extremely large and beautifully done Every piece has an explanation or at least a title in English The collection is amazing and very well displayed It is super easy to get there on the subway,Positive
376,Histories from centuries ago was well presented common visitors like us without any historical background could follow through the era and understand the evolution of korean civilisation We missed the guided tour as there was no english tour on Monday,Positive
377,The cultural diversity and different sections in there that cover a variety of Asian countries are quite unique,Neutral
378,It was also free at least the day I went The interior of the building alone is worth a visit and then its the home of a wonderful collection,Positive
379,This place is huge so unless you have all day you need to be selective Go to the Information desk on arrival They will help you download an App with a description of most of the exhibits and if you have your passport or drivers licence with you they will loan you ear plugs Then its off for a wander We thought the Museum shops were reasonably priced and far better quality than the tourist stuff for sale in Seoul generally There are plenty of very clean toilets and caf\xc3\xa9s to make your visit comfortable Easily accessible on the underground well worth a visit lots to see,Positive
380,Show the work rotation depending on the management of the exhibition Both of Korea And items from other countries borrowed to exhibit The formatting is very interesting Anyone who likes a museum should not miss it,Positive
381,Very good feedback and demonstrations of the people of Korea The museum is clean and tidy Good attraction to visit,Positive
382,Entrance is free Huge exhibition space with many floors However most of the descriptions are in Korean,Positive
383,Sign up for a tour to get the most out of your visit I visited the museum several times so see new exhibits Its worthwhile,Positive
384,The museum is very big full of interesting things Its architecture is spectacular There are tours in many languages and a lot of English explanations The admission is free but some exhibits are charged This is the place if you want to learn more about Korean history,Positive
385,The building housing the National Museum of Korea is quite simply stunning; it is worth visiting the museum just to admire the architecture alone  a wonderful example of modern design fitting perfectly into its environment  Entry to the permanent exhibitions of the museum is free and brief guides are provided in a number of languages  Across the concourse from the permanent exhibition halls is that used for Special Exhibitions for which there is a charge We didnt visit the special exhibition  Within the permanent exhibitions there really is too much to take in on one visit and so we decided to concentrate on ceramics and pottery In a nutshell the First Floor covers Prehistory and Ancient History Medieval and Modern History; the Second Floor exhibits Calligraphy and Painting and Donated Works and the Third Floor Sculpture and Crafts and Asian Art  Exhibition halls are spacious high ceilinged and well laid out The areas flow into each other and sometimes there is a lounge off the hall There were lots of school parties there when we visited and there was plenty of space for the children to sit on the floor with their leaders and discuss what they had seen The space here is enormous its hard to describe  There are at least two museum shops  good quality souvenirs notebooks etc and one shop concentrating on offering discounts on items from previous exhibitions  There are good toilet facilities on each floor and a number of places in which to eat and drink We relaxed at the Tea Rooms enjoying a delicious ginger tea  Given more time I think we might have taken an English language tour  there are six per day four in the morning and two in the afternoon The museum has a good website so am sure that details could be found there  After you have finished in the museum take a wander through the grounds until you come to the Pagoda Garden worth a look  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit it felt like a real privilege to see it and share in it We would thoroughly recommend a visit,Positive
386,The Korean history over the last 3000 years was very well documented and displayed at the museum  I was very impressed with the spirits of Koreans over the millennias overcoming various adversities and human calamities Its adoption of Confucianism was critical for the development of the Korean Empire over the centuries  I was very surprised that the last dynasty of Korea lasted for more than 900 years much longer than any dynasties in China the longest of which was about 500 years  The museum is also conveniently located near metro station  A must visit for all visitors who want to get a sense of the historical importance of Korea,Positive
387,Its huge You can see many historical artefacts findings collections and learn about history olden days culture and the tradition ways of korea They have new exhibitions too,Positive
388,We ended our visit on a Thursday late night at the Museum at the Pagoda restaurant My friends all opted for the prix fixe menus Korean and Italian and thoroughly enjoyed I decided on something different the octopus bibimbop  and thoroughly enjoyed It was more like a deconstructed bibimbop with the rice on the side to be added A really good variation on a traditional dish,Positive
389,If you want to understand the history of Korea this is the place to be It is the largest museum in Korea which houses precious Korean cultural assets You will learn the history of Korea from ancient times to the modern era To get here just go down at Ichon Subway station exit 2 The subway is connected to the museum via underpass,Positive
390,The museum is very complete and modern the exhibits in the first floor where specially appealing to me since I love history it shows a very detailed history of korea from prehistory to the modern times The museum is small and may not have a whole lot of pieces in display but mind you that for a country that has been looted and pillaged various times through the centuries the museum collections gives a very complete image of the korean nation highly recommend if you have the time,Positive
391,Im gonna start of by saying that these sorts of museums are often not something I enjoy that much With that said I did not think the content of the exhibitions were that interesting There was definitely some cool things on display But also it felt for me like 50 was different pots and porcelain Which some might find interesting but quickly gets incredibly dull in my opinion But what really saves this place in my eyes is the building itself Which is enormous and I think incredible both on the inside and outside with surrounding Also the museum is for free So if interested I definitely recommend going here and if you find the pots as dull as I did atleast you will have the building to look at Additionally I did not take any tours Audio nor guided so maybe that would have enhanced the experience,Positive
392,Easily accessible by metro Admission is free unless you want to see the special exhibitions I went there on a Sunday so there were lots of families with kids there Quite a wide coverage of collection of different artefacts,Positive
393,Beautiful building with a large collection Over the last ten years I have paid multiple visits to this museum and find myself returning to it often The pictures I uploaded are from the temporary Goryeo exhibition in 2019,Positive
394,This is a place for people who knows how to appreciate historic artefacts  especially artefacts related to buddhism Otherwise I do not recommend this on your itinerary Especially because the exhibits were rather niche That said it has a nice and clean environment There were also 3 levels of exhibition halls,Positive
395,Finally got the time to visit this one yesterday Specifically loved the paintings gallery in 2F Worth a visit,Positive
396,This museum claims to be the biggest in Asia by floorspace It may not be true but it is certainly big The art displays are excellent There is a good restaurant,Positive
397,As a foreigner I have been following Korean history Not through the book but by watching Korean movies Goreo Joseon All make sense via easy arrangement of the exhibition halls Anticlockwisely it explains Korea history from early to modern,Positive
398,Easy to go to as there is an access from the train station Extensive collection of historical artifacts I learned a lot Download the app for an English guide which was so helpful Visit their garden around the museum,Positive
399,This was a nice place to spend a rainy morning The galleries are manageable in size and the collection is impressive,Positive
400,Short walk from the subway station Easy to find A lot of stuff to see and you really get a good picture of Korean history Remember to grab a map before you explore the exhibitions so you won get lost The museum itself is really pretty and the architecture is wonderful The view at the top is also cool Has lockers where you can put your stuff during the visit The museum was almost too interesting as I found myself walking around the building for the third hour,Positive
401,about a 5 minutes walk from the subway station the experience along this walk was quite impressive admission to the museum is free so thats even better signages are in english and overall easy to walk around in the museum,Positive
402,The museum was a very interesting look at the development of Korea over the years The gift shop provided very good gifts to bring home to family,Positive
403,First of all its easily located at the entrance of the train station exit Probably a 5min walk once u exit the train barrier to the exit  Secondly its free of charge There is no fees and you get 3 stories of viewing Probably taking you about 2hrs to complete finish walking and looking through all the displays However not all the explanation for the displays are in English At the basement there is an activity for the kids to trace  colour king Sejong face which could keep the kids occupied for awhile The facility is very clean neat and nice Definitely an activity for all ages  Thirdly visit this location as u watch the palace guard change ceremony which is located directly 500m in front of the museum entrance Which is free of course all the ceremony explanation are done in 4 major languages so u understand what is going on,Positive
404,Three story building housing many artifacts that give a full history of Korea from early time Reach easily by bus,Positive
405,Wonderful museum can easily spend a lot of time here learning about Koreas history Signs are in English on the exhibitions and there is a lot to see The museum is free and also provides free luggage storage and free lockers great for tourists There is also a resting area in every few halls to take a break or wait for others in your party to catch up Would highly recommend a visit here if you are traveling to Korea,Positive
406,It was an easy jump from Incheon and my first stop during my daylong layover The regular exhibits are free to the public plus there is a free app that acts as a docent to lead you through the museum to save artefacts of interest and search mustsee artefacts There is a restaurant on the 3rd floor to avoid the busy small caf\xc3\xa9s in front The museum is 100 wheelchair friendly however it sits on top of a small hill To me it was worth the climb,Positive
407,Being able to learn about the country that I truly admire is one of the greatest feeling and probably achievement This had made me appreciate more about Korea its people and culture,Positive
408,Located in a large open area this building houses the evolution of the Korea Everything is organised and the building is a modern spacious place  Very interesting and would definitely recommend it,Positive
409,Loved this place spent 1 whole day on the 1st floor with history of Korea and 1 day on the 2nd and 3rd floor It is free theres decently priced food including a vegetarian meal and its just a beautiful superclean modern building with so much wellpresented information Incredible,Positive
410,went to this place before we entered the palace since it is also located in the same area maximum time allotted is 1 hour please have a tour guide to explain minuet details to make the display items more interesting,Positive
411,A beautiful building with plenty of areas to rest and recharge There is so much to see and learn about Korean history Nice displays although some were dark The donated collections were impressive The grounds are a wonderful respite from city living,Positive
412,Ive been to most of the major museums in the world and this museum has the finest collection of Asian art hands down The focus is on Korean art but there are also strong exhibits with Japanese Chinese Vietnamese Cambodian East Indian Lao Thai Indonesian Mongolian and Filipino art as well Admission is free If you go on a weekday in the morning you will likely encounter bus loads of school children in the museum So if you prefer a more quiet visit you may want to go on a weekend or in the afternoon the kids seemed to be getting tired after around 2pm Guided tours are available I eavesdropped on a few different tours and they were extremely informative,Positive
413,Love it here They have the show in sections from the dynastys till the modern era Have audio in English also,Positive
414,A great way to learn Korean history The history reveals itself before your eyes when you cover the ground floor The art section on the first floor enhances the awe factor and very mesmerizing  The displays are wellarranged and flows very nicely in alignment with history Right from the 3 kingdom period to the Unified Silla Goryeo to Joseon dynasties The section on Joseon Dynasty will leave one with wonder and intrigue its a onestop destination to learn about the interlinked history of Korea China and Japan in the early Medieval and Medieval period Its so enlightening to know that Korea has richer and older culture compared to contemporary Japanese culture  Must visit place in Seoul,Positive
415,Very interesting Learned a lot about Korean history and its wonder people Great place to go and wonder around for a few hours Lots of historical stuff to see,Positive
416,The museum is located near subway Ichon station It is a modernized museum with gardening surroundings The admission fee of the special exhibitions are around 6000 but the permanent exhibitions are free of charge and they are worthwhile enough to visit You can see wellorganized artifacts of Korea throughout the history There are also many precious artifacts from other areas such as China Southeast Asia and West Asia And the special exhibitions are of even better experience We visited the the Joseon Dynasty Maps exhibition which showed the history of Korean people making maps of Korea and even the whole world The exhibition is very wellorganized with many technological designs You could scan the code to see the AR effects of the map with your mobile phone Many local people found the places they were familiar with in the ancient map The visitors were really having fun,Positive
417,We were super impressed with the National Museum of Korea There are so many good points to list  Beautiful interesting artifacts chronicling Korean history  Well laid out  Gorgeous contemporary building very spacious  Excellent English translations  Free entry  Open late some nights  We spent two hours here We saw all of the first floor Korean history then did a very quick lap of the second  third floors The grounds really are gorgeous,Positive
418,Free entrance and it is an interesting museum for all ages  The other building is payable Its a good place when it rains ,Positive
419,This place is amazing i went twice each time spending 3 hours looking around and i still didnt see the whole museum More than just a building with great artifacts you can also walk the ground that have a waterfall and genuine 1000yr old statues Even if museums are not your thing the view alone is worth the trip TIP they are open until 9 on Wednesday and you can see Namsan tower from the top of the museums steps,Positive
420,And I was very impressed by the Silla artifacts There were 3 special exhibitions at that time which I was not able to explore,Positive
421,It is a heritage museum where you learn about the culture of South Korea Entry is free and this is one of the best free museums I have ever visited,Positive
422,On the way back from the DMZ spent a few hours hours here Its free and a great place to learn all about Korea Simply put its a great visual learning opportunity and well worth the visit,Positive
423,If you are into Culture and Heritage it is ok The visit can be combined with a visit to the palaces in the area,Positive
424,Lovely surrounds and beautiful colleciton I spent many hours here Aside from a lot of loud and boisterous schoolkids it was nevertheless enjoyable,Positive
425,Done up and managed very well it is worth a visit for sure Take your time moving through the exhibits plan about 34 hrs,Positive
426,The museum is a fair bits walk uphill from the closes metro station The giant pagoda inside is incredible Lots of other cultural possessions inside from China Mongolia Rome Japan to name a few Very popular spot for schools and youll see lots of children and their teachers all over Overall it wasnt as impressive as I thought The War Museum is a better choice with more interaction,Positive
427,This is a huge complex with many interesting exhibitions Highly recommend You need a few hours to really soak it all in,Positive
428,Great museum to spend time in It has interesting exhibits to look at and we could spend hours in there,Positive
429,This museum was on our list to visit while we were in Seoul and we were so glad we did It was easy to get to by local bus which stops right opposite the main entrance The building is stunning and beautifully designed spacious and filled with natural light and the gardens and mirror pool are equally impressive We were too early for autumn colour but the trees should be even more beautiful in a couple of weeks The museum is free so it was busy with many groups of schoolchildren visiting on the day we went But there are 3 floors with many exhibition rooms so its easy to avoid the crowds The exhibits include periods of Korean history from prehistory to the Korean empire and sections covering traditional Korean crafts There are also sections covering Asian art from China Japan Central Asia and India Its easy to spend a couple of hours here We also had a wander around the lovely gardens There is also a small food court and a shop Well worth a visit,Positive
430,During our visit a special outdoor exhibition of traditional dance and music was preformed at the outdoor amphitheater which was an unexpected added attraction to a very interesting museum Two special exhibits plus the museums 3 floors of Korean art and artifacts kept us busy for several hours,Positive
431,For once I found myself with a day to enjoy whilst on a business trip to Seoul Usually imy visits comprise of the traditional airport taxi hotel taxi meeting taxi cycle Braving the immaculate Seoul underground helpful locals and clear signage meant I arrived without misadventure Simply look to connect with the light blue line 4 and get of at Ichon the covered walkway is well signposted and brings you into the beautifully manicured park surrounding the impressive museum Entry to the main museum is free but you do have to pay a nominal amount for special exhibit halls The ground floor is laid out chronologically with exhibits starting from from Neolithic times all the way through to the modern day I recommend you spend some time studying the timeline mounted on the wall at the entrance particularly if like myself you have limited knowledge of Korean history The exhibits are beautifully presented and most have a good English language explanation I am not sure how long I spent wandering from era to era probably about three hours but I was so immersed it didnt really matter With hindsight I should have done some background reading as my head was struggling to piece all the information together Second floor was focussed on art and ceramics with the third floor furniture and similar First  ground floor requires the most time There are cafes on each floor but are limited to mainly cake and coffee There is a food hall but it was a little too busy so I gave it a miss Spent thirty minutes sitting in the sun before walking around the mirror lake to visit the National Hangeul Museum This is an absolute must if you want to piece together some of what you have seen in the main museum Great day out free entry too and an awful lot of new knowledge to be fascinated by,Positive
432,My husband and I visited this museum on a cool raw day and enjoyed the free tour in English of the collections highlights we were the only ones at 10am Our tour guide was hard to understand but was a Korean history major so he knew a great deal about the pieces he was showing us and Korean history in general The stone pagoda golden tiarasbelts and the pottery at the end are beautiful The Museum gift shop was one of the best we found in Seoul very reasonable prices esp the postcard set of 25 for 10 The reflective glass makes it hard to take good photos of some items Compared to other Seoul attractions the museum is quiet and spacious built less than 25 years ago,Positive
433,I loved going to museum when going to difference places I learnt alot of news things when visiting museums There are alot of exhibition showing in October I remembered there was exhibition on Joseon dynasty Very educational for my brother and I,Positive
434,We visited on a chilly foggy autumn morning which was the perfect kind of day for a museum visit The museum is huge but is surrounded by gardens which are worth exploring On entering you are immediately taken by the ceilings design and the architectural simplicity of the exhibition halls off from the main rectangular atrium which has exhibits along its length We spent a lovely couple of hours observing the many exhibits my favourite being the rooms containing a variety of buddhas from across Asia Definitely worth a visit especially on a grey day especially as its free  If you are heading elsewhere afterwards by bus have a look for the shelter of memories which is a bus stop on the main road outside with tile memories in Korean embedded among the bricks  quirky  I just wish I knew what they said,Positive
435,A place where history and art meet together Its definitely worth the visit  well arranged places to eat and relax after you view the artwork I like it,Positive
436,Note when you arrive there you will see 2 entrance one is on the left the other is on the right Make sure you go to the correct entrance the right side The National Museum of Korea is free of charge The other entrance needs to pay  The museum showcases Korean culture from Paleolithic era until recent times Each era or each kingdom artifacts are located at different area Be prepare to spend half a day here as the collection is huge If you are hungry in between gawking at the wonderful collections there are a restaurant and a convenient shop in compound,Positive
437,The architect of the museum is so high I love this and try to go all the rooms I dont realize the story of the museum,Positive
438,I went to the Museum not knowing very much about the history of Korea This is a great place to start with all historical pieces accompanied with English notes I spent the whole day hetr and enjoyed the scene and architectural structures all around,Positive
439,If you happen to go to korea and is short on time or want to have a relaxing time be sure not to miss this place If you need to see old tradition or you want to have a good stroll it covers all of those Be sure to put it in your agenda when you visit Korea,Positive

441,the Museum is free which is great for a traveller on a budget the lay out of the museum is great and easy to follow and the exhibits are fascinating and a great insight into the history of Korea the art collections and other great exhibits I saw every exhibit in around 34 hours so it took up a good portion of my afternoon The subway station is so close as well as having a cafe and convenience store just outside the gift shop was a little pricey but that was to be expected,Positive
442,Great displays and beautiful architecture The water feature outside shows the magnificent setting to its best,Positive
443,The property is huge in the middle of Seoul with its garden extends over the area Interesting architecture of the museum wonderful dining experiences at the Korean restaurant and you can stroll in its amazing garden for a while,Positive
444,Huge space Impressive presentation Extensive displays of pottery and related artifacts The permanent displays are free Special displays have minimal admission fees,Positive
445,As Corea suffered wast devastation in up to three wars during the ladt century there is not that much left to be exhibited although exhibits are carefully presented in a very modern building,Negative
446,Fantastic museum from the outside in well set out with stories photos artefacts and displays Great start to those wanting more knowledge about Koreas ancient past,Positive
447,Went to The National Musuem of Korea It is in a beautiful setting with plenty of room for everyone There was a free concert on when I arrived playing great jazz The guy playing the saxophone was great The Musuem is always worth a visit Everything is beautifully displayed Lovely food and iced Citron tea in the tea room Excellent Museum shops selling a real variety and good quality merchandise,Positive
448,The largest museum in Korea it contains key artefacts that tell the story of the country There are also educational and cultural assets here meaning there is something for all,Positive
449,I loved this visit as I was impressed by the view of the museum both inside and outside Nice and informative and a good outdoor area to take pictures of military hardware like missiles,Positive
450,Good place to get to know about Koreas history well arranged equipped and maintained take a tour and enjoy the visit,Positive
451,This is a very large museum The number of artifacts they have collected is astounding You learn so much about Koreas fascinating history Id recommend a couple of hours to visit this museum They have many English written descriptions for the displays and exhibits If youre interested in learning more about Korean traditions and history then this is a must see museum,Positive
452,Loved the museum so much to see there lots of information given on this beautiful country must visit again,Positive
453,Need at least an hour Ground floor is interesting with the history of Korea otherwise 70 of the exhibition just all potterytrain station n bus nearby Its free but special exhibition is charged at 9000,Positive
454,There are plenty of reading materials that they provide in different language as well and its all for free They even have these stamp pad that you can roam around and complete as you go along the way Its amazing seeing them in person as we always see it in the korean tv shows and movies,Positive
455,The architecture is stunning the staff helpful and the exhibits themselves interesting and informative I got the audioguide and I spent an entire afternoon roaming through the museum I think those with an interest in history would certainly enjoy it The museum itself is very wellmaintained This is one of the best free activities Ive ever done,Positive
456,Well organized and very instructive it helps the visitors to orient themselves in Korean culture and history,Positive
457,Great activity for hot cold or rainy days This place is massive and contains a wide array of artifacts from Koreas history  This place does tend to get crowded especially during the summer heat  Getting there Metro Line 4 Ichon was station exit 2 will take you directly into the museum Inexpensive snacks at the CU onsite I had Kimbop and water for 3000W,Positive
458,The stunning modern architecture hides an amazing range of outstanding displays and historical information about the history of Korea Several levels of artefacts pottery art jewels recreated moments of history and paintings are some of the wonderful displays that will take you at least half a day to truely appreciate The garden is also beautiful Cafes and a food store fill the hunger void and a wonderful little restaurant can be found just as you come up out of the subway An absolute must when in Seoul,Positive
459,The design of the museum is lovely However the exhibits can be much improved We were unfortunate to have visited the museum to coincide with a school visit With kids out of control the museum became a market place of voices and vandalism My heart goes to the museum staff trying to handle these kids which by right should be under the teachers supervision,Positive
460,Wow Great experience and lots of things to see Clean Wellorganized Amazing artwork Joyful and beautiful landscape Lots of space Explored and learned Thank you for all the people who make it great place of learning and rest,Positive
461,Really enjoyed our visit The building is spectacular and the landscape  grounds fantastic  Exhibitions are good Disappointingly not so much around Korean War and modern history Perhaps thats in another museum  Theres a gorgeous area in the grounds worth walking around and finding  Dragon Pond Absolutely beautiful oasis,Positive
462,By this museum we can learn and understand about korean people We can take the photo inside the museum but not alllowed to using flash,Neutral
463,The museum itself is huge free of charge today works till nine oclock It has many objects shop lockers clean toilett etc,Positive
464,We only spent part of a day here You need more than a partial day as we did not see a lot of the Museum I highly recommend seeing the Budda section,Positive
465,Large museum with lots to see We spent a whole afternoon here Easy to get to on the underground The Buddhas were fantastic Also has a great outdoor garden area,Positive
466,Theres a lot to take in in this museum and I will admit my favorite part was finding cool art prints in the gift shop Theres a lot of pottery but many other things too I especially enjoyed the large Buddha statues,Positive
467,The building alone along with its vast gardens is worth a look but once inside you could spend a whole day Wonderfully displays depicting the history with plenty to keep the kids interested too,Positive
468,I visited National Museum of Korea 10 years ago If you love history artifacts and arts then this is a place you must visit The museum has everything you need to know about Koreas history,Positive
469,It was our last day in Seoul and our trip was in the afternoon Since we have been shopping and food tripping for 3 days it was about time to learn some history Very impressive building informative and entrance is free Its a must see before you leave Seoul,Positive
470,This was a last minute plan We took the metro and the museum is right there Free entrance and free guide Our English speaking guide was a gentleman in his 80s with a great passion for his country and history The highlight of my trip was the statue of Sidhartra as a young Buddha in the moment of enlightenment This bronze statue was casted 1400 years ago the special smile of the character is unique Our guide told us \xe2\x80\x9c if there is a Korean souvenir that you want to take back home is that smile on your face\xe2\x80\x9d And with that his tour concluded There are other treasures worth visiting,Positive
471,If you like history and museums A must visit A very large museum and very very clean Free entry Only special exhibits are paid Their tea shop on 2nd floor at the rear has excellent and delicious local tea Reaching the Museum is very easy You can take Line 4 Jungang Line to Ichon station Just follow the signs and there is an underground walk way air conditioned which takes you directly to the entry steps of The Museum The grounds outside are also very beautiful If it is NOT a warm day you can spend time siting in the grounds as well If you have the time you can spend the full day here It is better to see the Museum on your own rather than the free guided tours one hour Routes and directions in the Museum are clearly marked and the exhibits have a very elaborate writings and information,Positive
472,Highly recommend I would definitely recommend a guide There is a lot of amazing content We hired a personal guide and it was entirely worth it The guide drastically amplified the experience  Even if you dont have a guide its still going to be worth while Id plan on 2 hours per floor We split it up in 2 days,Positive
473,This was truly one of the best museums we have ever visited Extremely well laid out Fascinating Took the subway there Just a short walk from the stop  The museum is laid out in chronological order of the history of Korea Learnt an awful lot,Positive
474,There is not much hype on the Museum so we did not plan to visit it at all In fact it was only because it was located directly opposite the palace and we had some time before our appointment with our guide that we decided to pop in for a look  Entry is free There are lockers that require coins to rent but the coins are returned after you unlock the lockers  What we saw was mostly the history of Korea; the opinions on how it came to be how it developed and so on It was very interesting  Cater about 23 hours We rushed through it in less than 1 hour and regretted that we did not have more time to spend there,Positive
475,The place is beautiful i have been there twice and I still feel in awe with the beauty the collections are nice,Positive
476,My only problem was that the day we went it was filled with school kids Still had a good time but will go again,Neutral
477,We visited the National museum of Korea on a Sunday The place was crowded The museum was a 3 levels place The 1st floor was all about history and the 23 were all about culture and art The Brochure was available in Korean English and Arabic The museum was worth the visit every corner was well maintained and every item was well taken care off You will surely need to visit it for yourself There was a nice and cosy caf\xc3\xa9 on the 3rd floor I had my favorite mixed grains cold drink with rice cookie The drink was nutritious and cold  SEE photos,Positive
478,This is a new museum with a great collection of korean art THe building itself is impressive and the lightniung is great A nice pagode gives way to the museum secrets,Positive
479,I enjoyed this Museum it was close to the Gyeongbokgung Palace walking distance  The admission was FREE  The Museum was clean and modern History of Seoul South Korea  all the stages the country has been Thur  I enjoyed the pictures and props and videos that they had  If you enjoy history definitely come here,Positive
480,This museum is just beautiful Huge well laid out architecturally stunning We took Free English tour Since there is so much ground to cover I highly recommend the tour as it highlights some MUST SEES 90 minutes long it goes quick but provides interesting insights Even my 10 year old was enjoying it,Positive
481,This museum was very well laid out with the ground floor dedicated to the history of Korea up until the early 20th century I only had a few hours so I spent the majority of them there so didnt get a chance to see the rest of the museum but I had a quick glimpse of the first floor which had a calligraphy and art section,Positive
482,A good place to bring high school students to visit the museum However no information about the Korean War which we are very interested to know more,Negative
483,This museum is my favorite museum in Seoul with a vast array of artifacts ranging from ancient times to the era of the Korean War The museum is educational for learning about the history of Korea something which is mostly ignored in Western education Many of the rooms are not filled to capacity but the museum is spread out enough that there is plenty to see The top floor has exhibits on Asian history in general encompassing more than just KoreaI found these more interesting There is also a large quantity of pottery and calligraphy throughout the museum Admission is free and while an audio guide is recommended I found it cumbersome and unnecessary Many of the items have English labels and an English map is available,Positive
484,The museum offers a decent download of the history of Korea till the formation of modern Korea Sadly you wouldnt get to see anything like the impact of World War Alot of stuff are touch and go but that is understandable because Seoul also hosts many other related museum such as the National Palace Museum of Korea As an arsent museum goer it is just a pity that this museum is not a one stop shop  The key exhibits are in the first floor The 2nd and 3rd floors houses some arts pieces of Korea and artifacts of the world respectively I personally think that you may give these 2 upper floors a miss it time is a constraint  I can see effort in the curation but the collection especially on general world is quite thin  I spent a total of 45 hrs in the museum Entrance is free,Positive
485,I wont tell anything but suggest all to come here visit and get yourself to learn about the country Cool place one of the mustgo,Positive
486,i can tell you from extensive travel experience that this museum is a work of wonder the architecture organization presentation and landscape already make it a great place to visit and adding to the fact that it showcases the best of Korea for FREE is a great way to learn and appreciate Korean historyculture,Positive
487,The architecture is great the way the rooms and lighting both natural and electric really highlight the art  There is enough on display that everyone should find something interesting i was delighted to see the cultural influences of surrounding countries as that aspect is often skipped  I would recommend a visit,Positive
488,We enjoyed this peaceful amazing architecture and all of the many wonders within You can see so many different periods of Korean history here From the famous Turtle Boats of the 10th century through the Korean War and beyond A balance focus on events and culture Really a treat,Positive
489,Subway Line 4 will take you there Just follow the sign and then walk along the long corridor you will soon reach the museum  Very spacious and the environment is quite good Quite true its a bit cool in the sense that there are not too many people and the space itself is quite overwhelming  Good collection on Buddhist paintings and sculptures Must see  Some nice restaurants  Good for spending a few hours there This is my second time visiting the museum Think Ill still go back,Positive
490,We were so looking forward to seeing Danwon and Hyewon paintings in this museum It was easy to take matro line 4 to get there Walking through air conditioned tunnel we thought it is a great design to avoid the sun light The museum campus is quite big well maintained and free admission We asked front desk where are the paintings displayed The answer is they are in the storage room not in exhibit We dont know when they will be shown,Positive
491,Massive museum that is worth a visit  mainly Korean objects but some Asian particularly Chinese as well Plenty of English explanatory notes and videos and the apps are nice supplements Layout is reasonably good and one can easily spend half a day there Admission is free but tickets needed for special exhibitions Not many visitors and somehow the museum seems to be a bit cold and not very engaging,Positive
492,Its big museum with an extensive collection of archeological finds and art Furthermore its free There is only limited information on the more recent developments in Korea for which the History Museum of Seoul is a better choice,Positive
493,The National Museum of Korea is connected to the Ichon Station Line 4 and a comfortable walk both to the museum and within the museum While it is a big location with multiple artefacts to keep you occupied I will first warn that most of the permanent exhibits are of art and archaeological digs making the museum cover more about what Korea was hundredsthousands of years ago more so than what South Korea is now If that is what you want to see then the Museum is a great place to be in otherwise I suggest you take the time to explore Seouls other museumsdistricts which would talk more about peoples present lives  Otherwise its free and an appropriate location for wet weather There are also special exhibitions you can pay for and the National Hangeul Museum in close vicinity so you can easily spend a few hours here,Positive
494,Travelers are always looking for interesting and stuffs and this is one of them You will learn a lot of Korean culture and helps to understand their traditions The only inconvenient was the restaurant which didn\xc2\xb4t sell me a coffee and a cake they ask me to have a complete meal to get the service,Positive
495,There is not much too see compare with other museum in Seoul Dont think there is value to visit if you have not much time in Korea,Positive
496,This massively impressive building in Seoul is home to a lot of South Koreas History The building is made up of three floors and is spilt into a number of different chambers dependent on time periods of various kingdomsempires including the Japanese colonisation period There is however a lot of information so I would recommend either spilting your visit into a number of hours with a break in the middle or possibly a couple of days There is also a museum shop with lots of different gifts and also a cafe and a large exhibitionamphitheatre area just outside the building where they play music and perform And best of all its free and easy to get to by subway or bus,Positive
497,If you got your history classes in high school EU students then most of the information obtained here is repetitive Nevertheless it does generally specify on Korea I would recommend the war museum whocj gives the same information but more specified on their own korean history,Negative
498,This is a nicely organized museum Exhibition is arranged according to chronilogical order Going through the exhibit halls and rooms taught me a lot about the history of Korea I may be wrong but the artifacts often looked like recent replicas,Positive
499,Built in this location in 2005 Its huge So easy to get to from the 4 Metro Signs in the Metro pointing to the Museum We took the free docent tour Took about 120 Lots of information on the tour There is a huge breath to the museum We particularly liked the celadon pottery on the 3rd floor as well as the smaller Buddha statues Several restaurants and a food court,Positive
500,This museum is a cultural asset of Korea It shows the sequence of ancient Korea to modern Korea It is a grand building Entrance is free but special exhibitions were paid for Senior citizens get special discount Wheel chairs are available Different exhibits are displayed on different floors Sculptors on one paintings and calligraphy on anotherThe first floor had historical exhibits The routes were marked and therefore very easy to follow The escalators were small and very cute The souvenir shops had lovely attractive things and we were able to buy things to take home for friends and family The property had lovely gardens with colourful flowers and on going down a few stairs there was a big water body around which people were taking walks and some chilling on benches I wish I could have spent more time here,Positive
501,Went on a solo trip to this place as the wife had another appointment and it was totally worth it  The outdoor areas were beautiful and well designed The building architecture too was impressive  Going in you do not need to pay for an entry ticket however I believe that the special exibhitions are paid events  The first floor narrates the entire history of Korea starting from the stone age period to the korea empire Second and third floors belong to art and sculptures  I learnt so much from the artifacts and exibhits on display I now have a working knowledge of Korean history The first floor exibhits are structured in a chronological order so if you follow the recommended route you will not miss a part of Korean history  Only managed to complete the first level though due to time but would love a return visit for the other floors if possible,Positive
502,I saw very cool pictures of this futuristic place so definitely wanted to go and check it out The building looks really cool and there was a market right outside it and also down below very cool vibe and lots of fancy art installations around the museum We didnt go inside as we are not so interested in museums but it is definitely worth while just strolling around the place Totally recommend it,Positive
503,Three friends and I visited the National Museum of Korea after spending about a week studying the Korean War and we all walked away really glad we spent most of our day here After covering Korean history from 19491953 roughly we felt like we had a much better understanding of Korean history as a whole and loved the range and depth that the exhibits here offered I know the artwork was also worth seeing but I confess that we were museumed out by the point we hit the art we spent about 3 hours going through the history exhibits on the first floor alone that we more or less strolled through stopping only at the works that really caught our eye One could easily spend a few hours or a day here and it would be well worth it,Positive
504,If you dont read Korean and are not familiar with Korean history this is going to be complicated I walked through it but it wasnt engaging for me,Negative
505,Unfortunately we were rushed round this stunning museum by our tour guide It gives a fascinating history of Korea and has many uniquely fascinating exhibits,Positive
506,You will need one whole day maybe to enjoy this amazing museum Also visit the museum shop There are some nice quality things with reasonable prices,Positive
507,On returning to Seoul from a few days in the country we headed here for 23 hours before returning the hire car The place is vast so we didnt do it full justice but it is stuffed worth Korean treasures from across the ages Professionally presented well laid out there is a follow through route marked on the floor And it is free This is a world class museum,Positive
508,Mostly artifacts A nice big space but not too interesting Would have liked to see more art Dont expect to spend much time here unless you have a keen interest in Korean artifacts,Positive
509,A worldclass museum that has free admission and something for everyone The grounds themselves of this massive building are impressive enough and offer photo ops aplenty Once inside I recommend renting an audio guide device at the front desk so that you can get more information on demand about any exhibits or items you find particularly interesting Its only 1000 Won  There are usually concerts of some kind happening every Saturday afternoon which I was lucky enough to catch from the upstairs balcony of the cafe on the second floor just above the stage in the entry atrium  The building itself is a bit of an architectural marvel inside and out as icing on the cake,Positive
510,Wow How can we capture our full response to this beautifully designed museum Offering a vibrant span of Korean history plus mesmerizing art and artifacts we easily could have spent another couple of hours reading the wellwritten signs and descriptions about the diversity of Korea and beyond Pretty amazing to see art displayed through antiquity and modernity with technology offering enlightening new ways to enjoy their stories and masterpieces  The collections were exquisite and the cultural Renaissance happening in Korea is inspiring How amazing to get to be a witness to the transformation The visit to the National Museum of Korea informed the rest of our trip around the peninsula,Positive
511,This is my 3rd time here and I still enjoy it However I note that the exhibits hasnt changed much over the years We didnt understand the English guide much but because he was so sincere it would have been terrible to fault him,Negative
512,we went to the museum for a visit we pre registered for an hour and a half tour they have yours in several languages it was excellent without this you just wonder around and its too big it gets you to the right points so my suggestion usto do this your and if you want to stay you canstay longer,Positive
513,The museum was very nice and I enjoyed their collection of potter and the restaurant inside had a good variety of choices but I loved this museum for its extensive grounds We wandered all over the park area and enjoyed the playground walking trails pagodas and lake I almost didnt want to go inside We were there in the spring and the cherry trees were in full bloom but it would be beautiful in any season,Positive
514,We visited during a national holiday so there was not charge This is a really great museum to visit if you are interested in war history It has a floor dedicated to all the historical wars that Korea has been a part of and then a floor for the Korean  American war This is fascinating and certainly carries the Korean perspective on the war Wish we had more time there,Positive
515,Museum has quite a collection of the emperors history with beautiful drawings of emperors parades and how they lived There is a small gift shop on the premises which one can buy some Korean items at reasonable prices The antique cars were beautiful,Positive
516,A great place to learn about the Korean history The English guide was very knowledgeable and I had a great time The museum restaurant on the ground floor was lovely with great service,Positive
517,I was truly touched by the heart and soul of the Korean people The past hundred years of Korea has been a blind side of history to me I was given a free book on the History of the Korean War \xe2\x80\x9cKorean War 1129\xe2\x80\x9d Amazing how many countries came to the aid of Korea what War actually does to a nation what an oppressive regime can do and what Freedom does for the soul and a country,Negative
518,I enjoyed this museum The building is huge and modern in a nice surrounding area There are two main exhibition halls One with a permanent exhibition about the history of Korea through different artefacts and another one with temporary exhibitions The main gallery is free admission If you enjoy history and looking at different artefacts you can spend a few hours there I went on my own on a Sunday morning and I spent around three hours There are spaces for you to sit down and rest your legs There are also some cafeterias and museum shoppings Throughout the building I sincerely recommend,Positive
519,That was our last day in South Korea and our last day of the long vacation So we were a bit exhausted and the museum building is so big Its amazing the architecture and the collection,Positive
520,Since I love history National Museum of Korea is the best place to visit they had 3 floors and each floor describe different history I could spend hours inside The history also interest me,Positive
521,I do love a good museum but this one is particularly impressive It is incredibly large very modern and super organized All of the signs are in English too so there are no issues with understanding everything,Positive
522,The building is imposing and the exhibits very well laid out It is not cluttered and there are themed rooms with very good exhibits Well worth a visit while you are in Seoul,Positive
523,A fascinating walk throughout Korean history from ancient times to contemporary events across ample well curated rooms Everything is explained in both Korean and English Plenty of rest areas and coffee shops to make it through the long hours it takes to admire the amazing variety of art objects and information on display,Positive
524,I spent nearly a whole day at this museum It is such a beautiful space I felt calm and meditative within it LOVED the special exhibition of the tiger in east Asian Art It is the 9th largest museum in the world and I cant wait to go back and explore it all the more  OHand the majority of the museum is FREE Youll have to pay between 3 and 6 for special exhibitions,Positive
525,Extraordinarily beautiful architectural building with views to Namsan Hill The park within the Museum is really beautiful though our visit was in the dead of winter i could image how beautiful it would be in other seasons  some of the trees have their botanic names Highly recommmended for a visit if not just for the park grounds Comprehensive presentation of Korean history and artifacts and some in the park also,Positive
526,Extraordinarily beautiful architectural building Comprehensive presentation of Korean history and artifacts Plan at least a half a day to fully appreciate,Positive
527,For those who want to understand more on Korean culture everything is excellent in the National Museum of Korea including the exhibition souvenir shop cafe and the attractive musical performance I will definitely spend more time visiting the museum when I have a chance to get there again,Positive
528,Well organized exhibitions and very spacious and beautifully designed museum  Beautiful grounds surrounding the entire space,Positive
529,I attended the museum for a free English your which was informative and enjoyable The museum is world class and seems very new Taught me alot about Korea and enjoyable visit,Positive
530,The building and setting are spacious Exhibits are informative but include reproductions A pleasant way to spend a couple of hours on a rainycold day especially if you like ceramic pots there are tons of them,Positive
531,National Museum was one of the big museum that we ever visited and need more than 2 hours to look every exhibition inside it Just like any other national museums it had the exhibitions about past time But they displayed all the artifacts in good arrangement Besides that they also had Korean culture exhibition  To reach this museum just take mrt to Ichon Station and follow the directions Its free of charge If you come with kids we suggest you to also visit Children museum,Positive
532,I was hoping for more history and less pots The museum itself is massive and beautiful I found it hard to get into despite the great job they have done with the artifacts in the museum I did like the furniture exhibit The rest I wasnt much impressed by besides the massive pagoda Maybe I was just too tired to appreciate the museum but it was worth going at night to see the view of the N Seoul Tower,Positive
533,This beautiful museum is definitely worth your time The long history of Korean civilization is beautiful presented and the exhibits have English explanations so no need for a tour The main museum is free and there is a charge for special exhibits Its set in beautiful grounds and near a subway stop,Positive
534,Free admission at a first class museum All the donated collections on the second floor made the visit extra special The donated collections often contain hundreds of items from a particular collectors area of interest We were amazed at the generosity of the Korean donors and interested by the unique items that Japanese collectors had actually returned to Korea Sometimes in museums when items are arranged by time period and isolated smaller items seem to lose their beauty We were impressed that Korean collectors saved so many items from their respective areas of collecting even though the nation has endured such hardships since its independence Love the building and grounds Didnt have time to get to the special exhibitions but this place is worthy of a second day visit We were happy to see art in Korean everyday items like furniture money and even sewing items,Positive
535,I was expecting that they would have more Korean things on exhibition or was I in the wrong museum Ground floor was all about the Korea which is very informative But the 2nd to 3rd floor is disappointing I dont get the connection of the items on exhibit Its like since the pieces were donated by famous people I get it so they throw all those bits and pieces together But the interior and exterior architecture made up for the disappointment The museum is child elderly and Instagram friendly,Negative
536,An insightful look into the development of Korea over the ages Admission is free for the main hall Worth a visit,Positive
537,This museum is free It has around 6 exhibition halls and 50 rooms Like in every museum that you have been this museum has permanent and special exhihibitions There is also a separate museum for children It has EnglishJapanese and Chinese tours you need to check how many a day Subway line 4 will take ypu there Is really beautiful and has 4 floors that you will enjoy a lot be sure to have time that day is so many little details in some of the exhibitions,Positive
538,Go I mean it All the museums in South Korea were amazing and I went to at least 15 of them This museum is very well done with English explanations and a free English audio guide you must leave an ID to borrow the guides so bring your drivers license While there were no children in my group I saw lots of groups of children and they had plenty of activities and ways to keep them interested This museum really helped me to understand the history of Korea and its culture We spent at least 3 hours in the museum it just depends on your pace I would highly recommend going to the National Museum of Korea,Positive
539,The museum building is world class and was the most interesting part about our visit The museum is very well organized with a helpful layout that makes it easy to walk from room to room Lots of different types of Buddhas and history of the country Japan rule Buddhism ancient tools pottery weaponry etc As a foreigner in South Korea I could not fully appreciate the expansive rooms of rock weapons excavated pottery and the ceramic vase exhibition There are fire extinguishers everywhere; from one spot I could physically see eleven fire extinguishers At the restaurant we had a westernstyle salad and an octopus rice dish; both were very good and reasonably priced,Positive
540,Permanent exhibitions is Free Admission is required for special exhibitions But The special exhibition impressed me I RECOMMEND it Please refer to itI downloaded a 10 discount coupon from Baynaru  Good for you,Positive
541,The museum is huge You can easily spend 45 hours there It is a new building very contemporary looking with a lot of daylight coming in escalators everywhere marble floors  simply great There is a plenty of restrooms multiple coffee shops few large museum shops a storage place to lock your bag or coat I wanted to get on the English guided tour which is free the first one after the museum opening time I ended up being the only one on the tour It was only me and a tour guide  call it a private tour  The tour took around 1 hour covering a few main artifacts on the first and second floors I enjoyed it I also enjoyed perfectly brewed cappuccino in the coffee shop  5 stars highly recommended,Positive
542,I went on a quiet weekday and arrived in time to go on one of the free English guided tour of the museum It was a great way to get a brief history of Korea and a sense of what the museum had to offer Theres a mix of ancientold artifacts and art organized by the specific periods in Koreas history,Positive
543,Its free Very informative of their rich culture Just in front of the museum is another place for you to visit,Positive
544,There are a lots of heritage and treasure in the museum easy to go by subway it is worth to seeing museum and in the museum shop there are so many unique souvenirs,Positive
545,I thought there would be a Korean emphasis but instead there were many things from other countries so that I did not feel I got a good flavor of Korea,Negative
546,Because this is a national museum it is completely free Free lockers are also nice to stow your coat bags etc Korea is so low on crime I even leave my purse in the locker without worry Very interesting displays and art Not a lot in English as with most museums in Seoul But this museum is one of my favorite Seoul museums,Positive
547,The museum is huge Im not sure you can see everything in one day This is great if you are interested in Korean history I personally wouldnt bring kids here as it can get a bit boring There is a lot of pottery and the colors are bland so if you are tired from your travels dont go there it will put you to sleep but overall art and history lovers will like it,Positive

552,This place was our last stop of our Seoul visit I found it convenient because not only was the entrance free but it was actually worth your time Its a three storey building with many rooms to enlightened yourself on South Koreas history and culture Allocate 2 hours of your time because 1 hour isnt enough time to cover the area,Positive
553,This is a great place to learn about Korean history and artwork The museum is very large and modern with all signs in English too And its free We only had about an hour to wander around which isnt nearly enough Be sure to dedicate some time to this place,Positive
554,This is a wonderful museum allow 2 days to visit Beautifully displayed exhibits and a great coffee place with superb cappuccinos,Positive
555,The best bit is the building itself  as another reviewer wrote a museum of space It is simply cavernous and worth a visit in itself Like most Korean museums its also free But where are the contents  The ground floor contains the findings of numerous tomb digs  wellpreserved and beautifully presented My favourite object was a Roman glass jug think on how that got to Korea 2000 years ago but sit down first as your mind will begin to spin on what something that fragile had to go through to survive the trip  Upstairs are numerous collections of ceramics most donated and of really high quality and again beautifully displayed  The down side is that unless ceramics really are a core interest of you this museum doesnt have much to see Sorry but its even a bit dull I visited several museums during my visit and I fear they have spread the jam too thin,Positive
556,I visited the museum without much expectations as I just wanted to escape the cold but boy what a find The museum is very modern looking with a nice square and pond surrounding it The artifacts and layout is spot on because it was like you are walking the timeline of Korean history from their prehistoric era to the modern days Lots of sitting area to rest your leg Drinking water is even available Wifi is strong and the cafeteria serves decent enough food,Positive

559,The museum covers a lot of art and artifacts through the prehistoric era all the way up to the end of Korean Empire with the occupation by the Japanese  The museum is very large and has a very large small pond The museum is free however there are small sections in the museum that charge Inside the main museum is a restaurant and outside within the museum grounds has a convenience store and coffee shop  No shortage of restrooms either,Neutral
560,This museum is free to enter and is first class the way in which the exhibits are displayed clearly described in English was excellent There is very low lighting throughout which may be an issue for anyone with poor vision The museum itself is a very modern contemporary building that oozes quality  In summary this is a jewel in the crown of museums and one you certainly would not want to miss first class Allow at least one hour and possibly more if you want to take it all in,Positive

565,Worth a visit if you are into history they have everything from Neolithic to modern Korea as well as a South East Asia exhibit  It is close to the metro and only a couple of stops from the war memorial as well,Negative
566,If you like museums which do forget to put the date age year of the object and forget that the historical context of the presented artefact might interest the visitor you will love the second and third floor 1st floor Korean history is a little bit better displayed We enjoyed the architecture The building is huge and remembers a cathedral The food is good in the restaurant,Positive
567,We spent about 3 hours here The grounds were beautiful and the art was plentiful It was great to see history from another country through art Very well laid out,Positive
568,The National Museum of Korea is one grand building in the Yongsan area It can be easily accessed by metro to the Yongsan Station The museum opens everyday except January 1 No admission fee for the main exhibit hall but not for the special exhibition galleries  The building itself is huge and there are 3 levels We visited the main exhibition hall only We rented an audio device which gives verbal description of the artifact when to input the number on the show case It is very helpful as the rooms are always too dark and the description on the plague are too small to read  The 1hour free guided tour is very helpful too The lady tour guide spoke perfect English She showed us the highlights of the museum the pagoda huge Buddha painting scroll and some of the royal jewelry I highly recommend this  There are gift shops on every floor and they sell slightly different things from each other  We had our lunch at the Mirror Pond Restaurant which is outside the main museum We chose a set lunch of traditional Korean dishes which includes 10 different Korea food snacks kimchi porridge appetizers main courses desserts and tea It is different and quite enjoyable  If your schedule is not that tight you can spend a few hours in this museum to find out more about the history of Korea,Positive

570,Id definitely put this at the top of things to do in Seoul Go here before or instead of the palaces Excellent layout to the exhibitions and done in a way that one learns a lot about Korean history Does a good job of incorporating all aspects of life from food to religion to political systems to agriculture etc,Positive

574,This museum in absolutely huge The best thing is that it is 100 free  The building is a giant granite stone structure and located on the right side is the Korean history side From here you can see many things from prehistory to modern times The best highlight for me was the huge gold crown that the emperor wore and the 10 story pagoda There are three floors the first floor as artifacts while the others are dedicated to statues and paintings  On the left side of the museum is the special exhibition hall where they normally have special exhibits in You can check what is there on the official website and there is an extra charge for these exhibits I recommend dedicating a few hours and make sure to wear some comfortable shoes when visiting  They also have an application that you should download to your phone which is like a personal GPS audio guide for your trip  For more on the national Museum of Korea and other places in Seoul I have a like to my travel blog of Seoul in my profile,Positive
575,A visit to this museum is worth it just to take in the setting and the unique architecture of the building While the art collection is probably not as stunning as many would like and it is mostly related to Korean history the museum is easy to navigate and impressive in its design We had lunch in the restaurant overlooking the grounds The food was Korean fare good but not great; nonetheless we enjoyed sitting beside the floor to ceiling windows and taking in the view,Positive

591,If youre alone and nothing to do this is the thing for you to do  Theres a few sections in this museum but Id say the hanguel museum is the best interactive and very informative Its free Its accessible by metro Just right outside the station Forgot which one sorry,Positive
592,At the time of writing the ticket price was 6000 won  certainly acceptable considering the wealth of Korean history on display There are a lot of ceramic pieces to view great Buddha statues and artifacts from other countries such as china and India The museum is laid out so that there is no crowding around certain exhibits It is quiet clean beautiful and has food and drink on offer in the cafe  Here is the caveat to the five star rating If you are a family with younger members and are planning to go then unless your kids are smart and attentive they WILL be bored at this museum All of the children present during my visit were running around paying no attention to the exhibits and there is nothin child friendly in the main part of the museum Choose wisely,Positive

611,Spend as much time as you can here its a brilliantly designed complex with innumerable wonderful artefacts to see  Warning do not waste won on the audio guide  The 3000 won version sounded as if the translation into English was done and read by a robot and the vcommentary added little to the free information given at the piece  Only a tiny fraction of what is on display is covered  I returned it after two hours though I spent the whiole day there,Positive
612,This is a beautiful massive museum and is incredibly well done However we were a bit disappointed because it was basically full of artifacts from Korean and Eastern history My kids kept calling it the pot museum I should have done more research on the museum because we were hoping for more of an allaround historycultureartifact museum For such a big museum a lot of the items seemed repetitive If you like historical artifacts this is the place for you We also spent about an hour at the Childrens museum area which was nice It is meant for younger children probably 8 years or younger,Positive

627,The architecture of the museum is spectacular Its like going to a really top class  5 star Hotel than a museum They have a really worthy collection of Korean history and other areas But before coming to this museum i would also recommend the Palace museum and also the King Sejong museum under the King sejong stature They cover the parts of history which is important for Korean drama fans  this national museum adds to the experience i only visited the korean section but not the other floors I think about 2 hours will cover the korean section adequately There are lots of seats on each floor if you have parents who dont want wander around,Positive
628,We were in town visiting brother who works at Hangyan teaching music He highly recommended this museum for the architectural features as well as the art and historical items We were surprised at the majesty of the space we were moving through It appeared the building was thoughtfully built to house the art so that you are able to take in the art without developing Stendhal syndrome or feeling that you have seen too much  Highly recommend making this a must see on your next tour to Seoul,Positive

635,This is a museum that impressed me by far in Seoul On three floors and logically divided everything on display is beautifully arranged Once you are in the museum you are immersed in the history of Korea and Asia while it doesnt let you go You are so immersed in a visual experience that you loose track of time Entrance is free of charge and that surprised me since the interior and everything on display is really outstanding and well organized Awesome,Positive
636,I did not expect to enjoy a museum so much There is an immense amount to see as well as rooms that teach you about their scientific preservation process which was extremely interesting and which I found to be different to the typical museum because it elevates and informs the audiences perception or lack thereof of all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes that is invisible to the typical museum goers eye What I thought would be a quick stroll through became a three hour trip which was in itself still rushed so I could have gladly spent half or an entire day there Best of all entrance was free which is amazing considering this is an extremely well designed and organised museum At the lower section there is also a lovely souvenir shop to go through,Positive
637,If I do not know a City I start from the Museum I had only one morning free and it was really beautiful to be in this building and appreciate the Architecture outside and inside Not having knoledge of this culture I joined a tour and was a good experience not too long topic pieces Is true which the number of pieces it is not huge but it is a way to indulge and digest better what is in display Comeing from Italy I know to be spoild in our museum we host tons of incredible pieces of Art Here in Asia I found a different concept of border between Art and Handicraft Anyway in my mind now I have some more puzzle pieces to picture differeces in Asian cultures In this Museum the big lack in my point of view is in the display concept too traditional I aspected more interactive ideas or tecnological way to show working process An use of technology to display Budda in his original location or give information The Museum was full of student playing wit them mobile phone The same device could be interact with pieces in display telling the stories of each piece and make interaction between students,Positive
638,Im not an artist so to see pottery and paintings is just my stereotype of a boring museum and this fit my stereotype exactly,Negative
639,This is a grandiose and well organized museum My problem is that there are not so many artifacts worth seeing Perhaps my appreciation of historical Eastern paintings pottery and calligraphy is not groomed enough but I did not find many things in the collection compelling I appreciated the building more and that this museum is free,Positive
640,For first time tourists this is a must see Artifacts and history lesson in a building that is amazing itself Nice walk outside as well,Positive
641,This museum was very nice Lots of beautiful artwork Takes a while to go though and see all exhibits My husband and I enjoyed the free museum We did not go to the special exhibits so I cannot comment on those But there is plenty of interesting art and cultural pieces to see in the free museum and it will take you a good part of the day Plenty of bathrooms and plenty of places to get some quick food or drink There is a very pretty park outside,Positive

647,You can see from the second you walk into the huge atrium that this is going to be a world class museum The information is presented tastefully and clearly and there is a great deal to see Completely free too Seoul is a lovely city,Positive
648,The museum is located in the middle of a beautiful park  If it was just for the architecture the visit would already be worth wile Is a huge three floors building in which is located a very tall and ancient pagoda  They offer very good english spoken tours If you can you should take it  That museum show how proud Koreans must be of their country,Positive
649,Some of my traveling companions took two days to see the museum I did a quick walkthrough and it was impressive,Positive

654,I love going to museums i learned alot of korean culture while I was here in the National Museum of Korea  I suggest you go here weekdays as there are few people during weekdays; expect many tourist and locals during weekends ,Positive
655,A fantastic museum set in a really beautiful huge building on grounds with a lot of green and a big reflecting pool The museum is free and great for all ages The first floor spans the history of Korea \xe2\x80\x93 from around 2000 BCE up to the present day The upper floors have more concentrated collections or individual collections of donors There are excellent descriptions for the art and some really thoughtful and interesting layouts sometimes showing how pieces were found or excavated or laying out in drawing or simple metal work what the rest of a boat or statue would look like if still complete We easily spent three hours and we didnt even make it to the top floor I was also really impressed by the interactive elements they had for visitors who were visually impaired with replicas of some of the major works to be felt with accompanying braille descriptions I also saw a lot of children on field trips and it looks like the museum had created interactive guides for kids The museum is right off of the Inchon Station,Positive
656,Really great venue and easy to access There is an app to help you around the museum which you should download before you visit but free wifi at the venue helps Would return,Positive
657,It was wonderful that it was directly off the metro stop so it made it easy to find and get to The building itself is lovely and the admission is free I learned a lot about Korean history in this very cool peaceful setting,Positive
658,I visited this museum on my fourth travel to Korea and Im still thinking its a mistake For better understanding of Korean culture it must be visited immediately after your arrival Entrance is free Very friendly to English speakers Amazing and huge building with a nice design and breathtaking views from the city,Positive
659,This is one huge and well laid out museum I enjoyed exploring each exhibit and taking pictures of precious items that are important to the people of South Korea Admission is free to explore this massive museum There were many students there today on a field trip which made it more exciting to see children learning history Worth the trip to come and see,Positive
660,The museum is fairly new and huge Visiting here will help you to understand history and culture of Korea Make sure to stop by the museum shop at the end its the best place to buy pretty souvenirs that you cant find outside of the museum good quality and super cute at reasonable prices,Positive
661,The building is marble lined with alot of natural light which they utilize in a unique way The building is huge but the mustsee are Baekje Burner the Treasures from the Tomb of Hwangham The ten story pagoda carved from marble is absolutely stunning They do offer guided tours in english every hour highly recomend,Positive
662,Scale if the building doesnt reflect the quantity of exhibits inside Very thinly spread objects in a massive cavern of a place they could have shown everything in a building a fraction of the size,Neutral
663,The national museum of Korea its a must if you came to Korea In just a couple hours the museum shows the history of the country and also its a really nice view The museum has everything translated wich is nice if you dont speak korean easy access and a nice area,Positive
664,Easy access through metro station via Metro 4 No entrance fee Good to understand Korean history from prehistoric to 19th century,Positive
665,I went there for craftwork classes and that palce is amazing It brings the old and the new in its architeture Everything there makes it worth it,Positive
666,Go here You can spend a few days in this four story place It is a stop the subwayThere are discounted prices There are also rentals to hear about the exhibits along the way I forgot the price I am interested in the Joseon period so I spent most of my time on the first floor I also went to the fourth floor to the nice caf\xc3\xa9 and had cookies and coffee There is a childrens museum next to this museum It is centrally located and very easy to find There are cafes outside and also places to eat and sit A must see,Positive
667,Plan on spending at least 23 hours in this extremely clean and modern museum Lots to see Loved th 10 story pagoda,Positive
668,This is a great place to discover the long and fascinating history of Korea Its organized well so you can wander through rooms that represent the various periods and dynasties Contributions of each era are highlighted and explained in English as well as Korean There are a couple of gift shops where you can buy items that exemplify the artistic work of different times The main part of the museum is free but there is a charge to get in to the special exhibition area,Positive
669,Best English translations we have seen in Korea for a museum Better than Hong Kongs translations First floor is all Korean history we skipped the upper floors which appear to be artifacts and paintings Lunch at their restaurant was the best museum food we have ever had Highly recommended,Positive
670,This museum is one of the best that I have ever visited extremely large with a huge range of exhibits there is free wifi available plus food and drink outlets,Positive
671,Well we took a tour to see Seouls major attractions and this is one of them Lot of displays about Korean culture their history and practices of the past It was fun,Positive
672,3 stories of amazing things to see They took some time in designing a beautiful functional building The layout is easy to follow and there are maps in many languages,Positive
673,This is one of the most spectacular museums that I have seen The grounds are flawless the museum is interesting and sparklingly clean Great restaurants inside Permanent collections are fascinating Well worth a visit,Positive
674,Prior to arriving in Korea I intended to visit the national museum First I should mention that transportation in Seoul is superb It is quite easy to navigate the city and find out how to get to your destination According to a famous travel book I learned that this new museum may look deceiving from the outside by its StarTrak spaceship aura Dont be alarmed once you stepped inside youre in a different world Therere two buildings one the left is for special exhibition; one on the right is for permanent exhibits which is free to public  It is clear how hardworking and dedicated the museum curators have been to their national treasures I went to the top floor first and slowly made my way down The highlight on the first was a special room for the golden crown from Silla period I would say that such experience alone is worth the visit The artifacts presented in organized categories with welllabled translation in English The spacing and the lighting of each object in its special glass cases were quite pleasing to the eyes I spent about 3 hours total; wandering 4 floors of this incredible museum  The facility is spotless clean Theres a tearoomcafe on the top floor; next to a sitting room Security staff are attentive and courteous  Word of advice definitely wear your most comfortable shoes,Positive
675,Guide gave us nice explanation Well organized museum Very well expressed historical facts Wish I had more time and enjoy more detail But overall museum is not extremely big,Positive
676,its was worth of visit this place its took me 2 hours and 30min to see everything from ground floor to 3rd floorif you are really interested in history and collections this is the best place you must visit,Positive
677,This is a mustsee in Seoul to understand Koreans rich artistic history The guided tour was wonderful Sadly many labels and information in English are poorly spelled or translated Unworthy of a fine museum,Positive
678,Among my favorite museums in Seoul I regularly go there with family friends or even just by myself What ever your mood or the weather a fantastic museum to go to year round,Positive
679,An impressive building and an impressive collection of Korean artefacts and details of Korean history Laid out over three floors there was also an eclectic collections of items donated by local artists The museum also has special exhibitions from time to time but unfortunately we did not have time to see the current one on Egypt Easily found with the Seoul City tour bus stopping outside the main entrance Lots to see and could easily spend a full day if you took your time looking at all the exhibits Would be good for a rainy day and its free entry with a helpful leaflet in most major languages should you be limited for time and want to see the main exhibits,Positive
680,I went to this museum during a city tour The grounds are beautiful You will see some interesting thingsthe girls in their ceremonial Korean gowns are very happy to let you snap their picture As for the museum it is a very good overview of South Korea,Positive
681,I spent the better part of a day at the museum I learned so much about Korean prehistory and history The exhibits were comprehensive and offered just the right amount of information I was surprised by the lack of information about Japanese invasions and occupation and the Korean War Those might be at another museum maybe at the War Memorial of Korea I did not get to visit that one The museum is beautiful spacious and lightfilled even on an overcast day There were plenty of places to sit and rest The subway station had peoplemovers to the station exit so that you can save your legs for walking all over the museum The food court near the entrance offered a variety of entrees that were wellprepared and reasonably priced The outdoor plaza was a little barren but we went in November so that is not too surprising It is probably lovely in the spring and fall,Positive
682,This museum is a must to learn about Korean culture and history The gift shops offers interesting items at a reasonable price The restaurant outside of the museum entrance has good food much cheaper than inside the museum We returned to this museum in our limited time in Seoul because it was THAT GOOD,Positive
683,The design of the museum into a pagoda is very unique and empathetic of the surrounding heritage palace The museum itself is full of knowledge worthy of discovery I would recommend spending at least 23 hours here to explore the place,Positive
684,There is a museum and also real old street with old style korean shops its with same place another palace Check to close days before go,Neutral
685,NMOK use to be on a standstill a couple years back there wasnt much action going on and exhibitions were quite bland It has become much more lively recently and I am impressed by how much the exhibits have become lively and improved in content Now I feel like it is appropriate to say that art enthusiasts should definitely consider stopping by this great establishment,Positive
686,If you really want to know about korean this is the best place for you to visit If you want to know how south korean and north korean split come and visit this place You will never get boring,Positive
687,I went here expecting to have to pay some admission fee Low and behold the museum was free even to foreigners The museum is massive and if you really wanted to you could spend half a day there I spent about two and a half hours there and was able to see most of the major exhibits You get a very thorough overview of Koreas older history,Positive
688,This very modern and massive building is impressive on its own The historical artifacts are abundant and well displayed but the old fashioned handsoff approach is typical of most museums in the world therefore the kids lose interest quickly There are lots of details English and Korean for history buffs lots of art to explore pottery furniture and more The museum is free there are reasonably priced restaurants and coffee shops to rest your feet in theres also a reasonably priced and large store to get some tasteful souvenirs at They have a special exhibit hall which we missed so I cant comment on it  Egypt in Feb and March 2017 You need a least 2 hours to get through it quickly but 4 hours would be better if you want to read details If the weather is nice dont forget to go outside and walk around the grounds There are pagodas sculptures water features a giant bell and some nice paths to stroll on Keep walking east and youll find a large playgroundpark Its all worth the visit,Positive
689,This is one of my favorite Museum in the world And if you love Asian History it is a must This is the most amazing collection of ceramics ever  Be prepared to spend at least 3 hours or plan on coming back Even with that amount of time I didnt see everything Take time to contemplate the Buddha,Positive
690,As many know Korea has many large companies such as Samsung Huyndai etc This museum exhibits a lot of altered stories Basically it is just another place like the Korean palaces or tower,Positive
691,We really enjoyed our visit at this museum We were thrilled that they had an Egyptian display as a special exhibition Really well laid our and easy to access every floor,Positive
692,Well this is the type of place that a museum addict love This museum is huge 6 floor FYI With around 15000 collections Maybe I need to come more than twice to get to know every collection in here  This museum open from 9 am to 9 pm and free admission for permanent exhibition,Positive
693,Good for overview of Korean history but difficult to follow as the story was not well told ie did not flow well and there were limited English descriptions,Negative
694,I am getting a bit museumed out The ground floor was the best for me as it started back in the stoneage where I havent seen that in any of the other museums Some of the other floors had lines of pots that were very similar or open books which if you cant read Korean are just lost in translation If you are in Seoul for a few days then chose one of the museums but unless you are into all the Korean history then you will soon be over it I noticed that on the 2nd and 3rd floors even the locals were walking down the middle There are two cafes here so you can rest your feet,Positive
695,Entrance is free although you may need to pay to see the special exhibitions usually from overseas Kids museum too Massive modern space laid out over three floors well presented and interesting exhibits A bit like Ikea in that you follow a tortuous route but keep your eyes peeled as there are some stunning artifacts tucked away just off the main path,Positive
696,Very informative museum with great displays of Korean wars from the past Its freewho can ask for more than that Three floors x2 Most everything in English as well as Korean,Positive
697,This is a very well presented look at Korean history from early days to present It is a beautiful space with amazing artifacts and there is also a childrens component the kids part requires a timed entrance ticket so grab one when you arrive if interested We spent a day here and walked through the whole of the exhibits and our children 7 9 and 11 stayed engaged for the most part The grounds are beautiful as well Overall a great overview of the history of Korea and a recommended visit for anyone living here or visiting this fascinating country,Positive
698,You will need a whole day to look at everything on the 3 floors of this museum We went for a couple of hours in the morning and there were lots of korean students visiting The building is very impressive inside and out The museum has an excellent collection that portrays many years of korean history Good for both koreans and foreigners Theres a cafe inside the museum where you could rest your legs We took a taxi into the parking lot where there is a drop off point but on our way out we had to walk a little bit to get to the streets to grab a taxi Well worth the visit,Positive
699,Along with the Korean War Memorial it was a really nice way to spend the day just by walking around,Negative
700,This museum has some amazing exhibits and is worth a visit but limited English descriptions and repetitive nature of the exhibits means you dont need to spend a lot of time here Was good at exhibiting but not so good at telling a story If you like a traditional museum this place is for you,Positive
701,I spent 3 hours in this marvelous place only managed to go through the exhibit on 1st floor out of 3 floors plus specialseasonal sections Had a better understand on the history of Korea the various eras and dynasties vs the development of surrounding countries such as ancient China Japan etc  A must visit venue for the history buffs,Positive
702,What an amazing place It covers much of Korean history through art and artifacts including painting furniture needlework pottery and other things It is well laid out in an expansive building that is wonderful There is a spacious main hall with the exhibits off of this The atrium entrance is stunning in its design and we were wowed We asked information about the architect and she told us that many visitors ask that question We enjoyed the museum learning much about Korea and enjoying a Korean architects design,Positive
703,It is the right place to see learn  understand the True Korean culture rich history of Korean is on display here worth Spending whole day here,Positive
704,I visited the National Museum on my own while on a family vacation This is an expansive complex that is impressive in its own right Space is scarce in Seoul so experiencing the landscaped grounds and the massive building itself is already notable This is a good break from much of Seouls commercialism and it is a good way to spend a cold or rainy day The main museum would not be fun for kids; its geared for high school students at a minimum  Getting there You can get there from the Ichon Station on the Seoul Metro 4 line This line is convenient because it also runs through Seoul Station and Myeongdong You need to travel some distance from the stop itself through two moving walkways and up weaving stairs Its possible to travel the entire distance on wheelchair but if you have trouble walking it is quite a trek  First Floor If you go through the first floor by beginning on the right side as you enter and proceeding counterclockwise the exhibit will unfold chronologically from prehistoric times to the beginning of the 20th century As an American its impossible to see Korean history in such quantity at one time Its quite a treat  Special Exhibit I was able to see a very manageable but very informative exhibit of the muchoverlooked Baekje Kingdom which goes through the end of January 2017  2nd and 3rd Floors consist of donated works calligraphypainting Asian art and sculpturecrafts I did not see these floors  Building The building itself is extremely large Others have commented that the museum feels relatively empty To me this is a plus Visitors can explore at their own pace and dont have to worry about being swept up in the crowds  English language There are a few English language tours an English language map and an audio guide which I did not use Each major section has a good English introduction and most artifacts have at least an English label,Positive
705,The National Museum of Korea is easily accessible using the subway Get to the Ichon station which is on the 4th line and there should be signs showing directions to the museum The museum is about Korean history that starts off from the very beginning to the end of Joseon dynasty Would recommend to museum loving enthusiasts or anyone that wants a piece of Korean history,Positive
706,The place has a lot of history an tremendous teaching areas It provides ample learning of tools for all those who visit it,Neutral
707,Its a good place if you want to learn Korean History and I would say that its one of the biggest museum that I visited in Korea I think going to this museum is enough for you who wants only a brief history of Korea Its an indoor activities and english services are provided,Positive
708,Good place to spend a few hours to know about Korea history and the treasures of Korea The place is huge so we first took the guided tour in English to get an overview of the museum Only after that did we start exploring on our own  There is pretty good view outside of Namsan so a very nice picture spot Food court is pretty good As this is our first stop after landing in Seoul it serves as a good introduction to Korean food,Positive
709,Very interesting place to visit Very educational and handson experience is superb A great place to spent time with your family especially for your kids,Positive
710,This building is very impressive and large good to learn about Korean history and it was free entry on the day we went Inside there are quite a lot of exhibits but some are very repetitive and plain One room of porcelain crockery doesnt really showcase muchall kind of blank with no motifs or designs There are some things worth seeing but all in all it feels like the space could be used with a lot more exhibits Good museum for Seoul but on a global scale its fairly average at best Worth visiting if time to spare or interested in Korean history but if pushed for time may be better places to visit,Positive
711,I spent four or five hours engrossed in the many exhibits A good way to spend a wet day The galleries are arranged by the periods in Korean history from the paleolithic to the Joseon dynasty and is an excellent introduction to the countrys story  I felt however that the museum could have had more to say about Koreas interaction with its neighbours through the centuries  trade cultural etc  and about the modern period including the years under Japanese rule  Then again better not as the museum seems to maintain a somewhat nationalistic tone  There is a food court within with reasonably priced dishes  The museum is easily reached by metro Get off at Ichon station light blue line and follow the signs from there,Positive
712,Amazing museum Free entrance It has three floors with tons of exhibition room It has a gift shop in every floor also a food court Translator wheelchair rental Beautiful landscape Amazing museum,Positive
713,If you have time be sure to go here Easy by subway There is a little store next to it where you can buy snacks Entry is free This is a huge modern building with some magnificent works in it Does a very good job of telling Korean history from the very beginning Will take an entire day if you let it You can take photos inside,Positive
714,I spend a whole day visiting this museum and two next door The view from the entrance is awesomeYou can see the Tower An excellent aspect I found was that the entrance is free except for special exhibits If you are interested in Korean history this is the place to visit although not everything is translated into English But it is worthy every penny not; it is free Do not miss the Hangeul Museum It is a short distance from the National Museum follow the signs Get a good pair of shoes since the whole visit demands some walking,Positive
715,The museum is big  really big I only spent a few hours there before my legs started getting tired but you can probably spend a few days here digesting all the exhibitions and artifacts in this museum One note is that it is a substantial walk although some of it is underground and protected from elements from Ichon subway station to the museum  What is interesting is that the outside of the museum hold some of the greatest views in Seoul There is a large manmade lake in front of the museum as well as a large open area in the entrance of the museum There is also an area where you have a great view of Namsan Mountain and N Seoul Tower  The museum inside is very modern and expansive There is a lot of free space though punctuated by a ten story pagoda in the lobby area of the museum There are three floors filled with exhibits and artifacts Definitely worth a visit of a few hours,Positive
716,We spent 212 hours at the museum with our day tour guide who gave us a wonderful overview of some of the major exhibits To do it justice would take 23 days On entering the incredible building one is immediately attracted to the 10 story Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda at the end of the main hallway Constructed in 1340 from marble rather than granite the pagoda is a Korean national treasure It was stolen and shipped to Japan in 1907 but was returned in the 1960s after international pressure on the Japanese government Also a must see are the various Buddhas and other historical artifacts that have amazing detail and workmanship The museum was busy with many young students observing and making notes but at no time did it feel crowded because of its spaciousness We also noted that the students were taking their excursion very seriously and well mannered On leaving the Museum we were pleasantly surprised that we were engaged in English by a small group of teenage students who wanted to try their language skills The students were extremely polite and we had a pleasant conversation until we parted ways in the coach parking lot We enjoyed the contact and the students seemed to as well,Positive
717,The National Museum of Korea in Seoul is a wonderful facility It has wonderful Korean history items but the buildings would be worth a visit if they were empty Great experience,Positive
718,This is a very large impressive buildingand grounds that I believe was built in 2005 Unfortunately while the building is large  impressive the way artifacts are displayed seem like that of a much olderdated museum bottom line not very creative or interesting It was difficult locating the museum as it seemed like no residents have been or even have heard of this museum Entry is free must be funded by the government yet there were just over a handful of visitors therepractically empty and this was on a rainyperfect for going to a museum day If this museum was selfsupporting I imagine it would be hemorrhaging tens of thousands of dollarsday due to its extremely low attendance We had lunch at one of the nearly emptyrestaurants While I love most Korean food what we had was pretty bad What a shame a lot of money went into constructing this museum,Positive
719,The museum is so big and they have great collections of different ages Personally I was expecting more for them to be the national museum and Korea has so many amazing museums all over the country Other museums in Seoul like Samsung museum was more impressive and they carry sophisticated products But its still a great museum with restaurantsokay and cafesgreat tea room for spending your whole day There are exhibits outside too They provide museum study tour for children too we saw korean families bringing their children and the kids join the tour by themselvesget a lunch break with their parents but I dont know if they have one in English,Positive
720,This Museum is recommended to travellers who wants to know more about the history of Korea There are also souvenir items to be bought at an affordable prices,Positive
721,Wonderful history lesson on Korean culture Shame that the Joseon exhibition was closed but the other exhibitions made up for it Audio guide could be improved,Positive
722,I have been to the museum a couple of times It has an impressive architecture and is particularly beautiful at night with its reflections in the front garden pond Access to the museum is quite easy by subway and there is a special underground walkway going from the subway station to the museum There are museum decorations along the subway so it make the walk less boring There is a huge collection of historical items in the museum and a walk around its compound is enjoyable,Positive
723,The museum is large but easily accessible Wheelchair users will find that many portions of the facility to easy to reach You will see a wide range of history and art  You will learn about the nations history its rulers wars culture art and the people Regardless of your interests you will find something that grabs your attention  We went during a weekday and there were many school groups present Even young children seemed to enjoy the place  There are several places to eat and to shop The restrooms are clean  Amazingly admission was free,Positive
724,The National Musem of Korea has rooms full of interesting displays We enjoyed our visit and learned a lot about Korean History and Culture Highly recommend spot We lucked out and had a Korean tour guide walk through the museum with us,Positive
725,I would highly recommend spending a few hours in the National Museum of Korea The building itself is quite amazing with an obvious amount of Fung Shui consideration going into the layout Theres a fantastic view of the mountains and the Namsan Tower in the distance The grounds with the pond and pagoda are well worth a stroll as well All thats even before you even set foot inside The main building with the permanent exhibits is free of charge How can you beat that Obviously the main focus is Korean history beginning with prehistory There are a few rooms of various other Asian cultures on the third floor though These could probably be missed if youre tight on time or youve seen more extensive exhibits in other museums The second floor is pretty amazing if youre a fan of pottery as I am Ive never seen so much celadon ware in one collection before Metalwork too is well represented The special exhibition hall has a charge attached but at 5000 won about 450 USD I thought it was more than reasonable Plan on at least 3 hours or two trips to do the place justice As you would do with any other worldclass museum,Positive
726,We liked this museum Had lots to see Left us pondering Great display of artefacts Facilities were clean with drinking stations everywhere which was very useful Lots of seating too Nice views of Seoul N tower too,Positive
727,Wonderful collection in an equally wonderful building with extensive grounds Very easily accessed by purpose built tunnel walkways from Ichnon subway station There are free English language guided tours twice a day 1100  1430  definitely worth joining to get an overview of the museum and to view the must sees before walking around at leisure Our very knowledgeable guide spoke excellent English,Positive
728,The landscape and the building itself is worth visiting never mind the exhibits  I was very taken by the architecture of the building right from the entrance the hallway etc For unknown reason there was hardly any visitor on the day I went They do not charge admission but I rented the audio for self guided tour for SKW 1000 approx US 1  The gift shops one on each floor have remarkable selection of souvenirs for more than reasonable price ,Positive
729,Nice museum surrounded by great outdoor grounds for walking and taking pictures Nicely laid out museum easy to get around in quite interesting with a few shops and caf\xc3\xa9stearoom,Positive
730,Awed by the grandeur of the palace The biggest and the grandest of all the 5 palaces There were a lot of people from different nationalities Saw the 3 buddhas It has the Kings office A huge kitchen kings hall where he entertains his visitors I even posed with the palace guards Truly beautiful,Positive
731,Grand history and magnificent treasuresThe park surrounding the huge museum is beautiful and a lot of local kids enjoyed itIt is free to enter and spans three floors with a fantastic collection of art and ceramics from across Asia and Korean history,Positive
732,The National Museum of Korea will take you on a historical journey through the different ages of South Korea,Neutral
733,Although the exhibits were not that many for its size  Definitely worth visiting though  Modern and welcoming,Positive
734,Main exhibition are entrance free I happened to chance upon Hangul day when I went they have some activities and performance at the atrium Restaurants served proper food  You can take a walk in the Yongsan Family Park which is located just next to the museum too,Positive
735,Its a modern and mixed with culture museum I think We can see traditional clothes traditional house and other things Also there is a museum shop if you want to buy the souvenirs Clean toilets visitor information And good for you to come here with friends and family Enjoy,Positive
736,Maybe because I was already tired from being at the War Museum just before visiting this place but personally I found the War Museum much more interesting  It was more so artwork here and history of the artwork,Negative
737,We spent our one rainy day in Seoul here My husband moved at a very slow pace He loved it I people watched and enjoyed wandering around the well laid out exhibits We had lunch here pretty decent food at a reasonable price,Positive
738,Really recommended to go to this museum you can easily catch a train to go directly to the museum green line We spend 23 hour here wandering through the garden and the hall On occasions there are outdoor theater as well likes esplanade in Singapore,Positive
739,To be honest about half of the artefacts here are presented too drily shorn of context in plain glass cabinets Especially on the ground floor However the excellent exhibits on the top floor make it worth a visit They include a moving changing frieze of traditional Chinese painting which is probably the single best thing Ive ever seen in a museum anywhere in the world The gardens are also fantastic perfectly peaceful in the middle of one of the worlds largest cities very beautiful too Walk over to Dragon Falls its simply idyllic,Positive
740,Very easy to get to this museum is gigantic I suggest wearing comfortable shoes and getting a good nights rest before entering  The collection is very impressive and the souvenir shops have some great offerings I recommend visiting this place once,Positive
741,This location is walking distance from the Ichon and Seobinggo metro stops The museum has several interesting displays that are worth seeing as well as a kids section Next door is the Hangul Museum which is also a nice visit Enjoy both in one trip,Positive
742,This is a huge museum I visited for a full day and only saw maybe half of the collection Got tired So bring good walking shoes  Not a lot of places to eat around here But maybe I just didnt know where to go So you will end up eating inside the museum Which is a bit pricy  Lots of old Korean jewelry in the collection when I was there,Positive
743,As with all my reviews to sights in Seoul I will preface this by advising visitors to carefully check opening days and times and whether timed entry tickets are needed to access certain parts of the attraction and also the times for booking guided tours in their language of preference \xe2\x80\x93 bearing in mind that numbers can be limited  The reviews here are a little mixed And I think the reason is that sometimes a building is better than the artefacts it is designed to accommodate Not to denigrate the artefacts as many are fine objects in their own right and have historical and cultural significance for Korea  The approach to the building engenders a sense of expectation A wide open air stair case frames a panorama of north Seoul with the iconic Naksam Tower as a central focus in the distant horizon  Inside the cathedral like space is immense with the entrance being a spectacular rotunda formation soaring to a great height The sense of space is exaggerated by use of simple finishes with creamwhite marble and stone walls and floors The entire building is an outstanding example of public architecture on a grand scale  Visitor amenities are excellent Outside there are pleasant grounds which the hordes of visitors use for picnics and leisure  When I visited there were numerous school parties dashing around trying to complete their Ispy books  they were noisy and intrusive  taking away some of the pleasure of the experience  Public transport access is easy from the nearby Metro Station,Positive
744,I have visited many museums and to be honest after a while they tend to become a blur This one did not and I think that this was largely due to our English speaking tour guide you have to book when you enter the museum I learned so much The childrens part is the usual hands on dress up offered,Positive
745,Reachable by train but u need to walk 500 m after dont worry It has connection with the subway station i stayed in lotte hotel seoul and takes around 45 minutes to b there its a big museum too much space i think   collection r great yet its all abt korea good for history subject student and for those who curious abt the ancient of korea  if you are adventurous person dont put this on your list  good escape from the crowd of city very nice view outside the building,Positive
746,The museum building and grounds are very pretty and has its own train station  The first floor inside is the most interesting part in terms of history everything else is for art lovers I guess and people who can appreciate ceramics Would be great if they had more exhibits like maybe what prehistoric animals  dinosaurs they had in Korea  If you had to choose between this and the war museum go to the war museum Wouldnt spend too long here,Positive
747,Very interesting building in its own right The collections are very well organized especially if one is not too familiar with the very long history of Korea The building is large and spacious so it takes some time to go through it even if one does not read everything We signed up for the tour with one of the English speaking docentsguides She was very informative and pointed to the exceptional pieces whether for their historical or artistic significance,Positive
748,This museum is really big if you want to get a closer look to everything you will need a few hours Entrance is free which is really great thats whay you cant go wrong with going here If you dont like it just leave  Although you can see a lot of things it can get a bit boring after seeing the 1000 Buddha statue,Positive
749,Not worth it unless youre bored and its raining I heard this is one of the biggest museums in Asia Unfortunately I was underwhelmed Huge space with little content  Also there was a HUGE exhibit for Dok island which was a waste The only thing they showed were pictures of rocks,Negative
750,Probably one of the most impressive museums Ive ever been to  just goes to show what museums can look like if they have enough funding  The exhibits themselves are fabulous  well researched indepth and such a huge variety of objects and approaches to their display I especially enjoyed their approach to showing archaeological processes and finds The architecture itself is impressive in itself  just enormous and so wellmade My only criticism would be that I thought the layout itself was a bit banal arranging the exhibits in chronological order Other than that I could have spent hours in there just wandering around and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an insight into Korean history The shop also sells some beautiful objects albeit expensive and is well worth a look,Positive
751,Visited the national museum this august As an Asian Studies student it was quite intersting seeing how they kept referring to china in the museum and it basically looked as though Korea is nothing more than a side effect of the chinese rise  The museum offers a free tour a couple of times a day The guide didnt actually know english and basically just stated whats written about the artifacts but it was still nice  Id very much reccomend this place for a rainy day It also has beautiful gardens nearby if you deel like a light stroll,Positive
752,very good place to know korean history kids can try to something and see some kind of show there are many things to see,Positive
753,This is a stunning beautiful museum worth the visit for the architecture It is tourist friendly with frequent quiet spots to sit and rest water fountainsand restrooms available The artwork is world class and there is a childrens area the kids will want to spend time at The outside is as beautiful as the inside,Positive
754,We spent an afternoon touring around the National Museum of Korea recently and were very impressed The museum grounds are absolutely lovely We would recommend walking around the museum to see the reflecting pond pagoda garden and other peaceful sights during your visit The museum collection itself is spectacular with a wide range of artifacts We took a free guided tour in English and would advise other foreigners to do the same The museum was crowded with school groups during our visit and it would have been tough to navigate the crowds without our guide We also learned a lot about the history of Korea on our tour The museum building is beautifully clean and modern It also has an excellent gift shop on the 3rd floor where I bought several nice quality souvenirs inexpensively We definitely plan to return to the museum during a less crowded time so we can see more of the collection Our favorite items in the collection from our first visit were the Buddha statues,Positive
755,Best place to buy souvenirs while in Korea You can find anything in the museum gift shop for anyone of any age Check out the great calendars,Positive
756,From the bronze dynasty to the baekje silla goguryeo dynasty to the current era Everything you need to know is here There are a number of national treasure displays here The best part of the whole visit is free of charge,Positive
757,The museum is huge with exhibits spanning across all of Koreas history We were told that there was limited English but there were actually a lot of descriptions and signs written in English it was only some more detailed descriptions on artifacts that was not in English so dont worry if the audio guide sells out as you will still be able to understand everything We spent almost a whole day inside and spent the afternoonevening wandering around the grounds outside which I would highly recommend doing if the weather is good The entry to the museum is free but I would have happily paid,Positive
758,This is a beautiful building Although we did not know when we arrived but the subway stop for this museum has an exit on the museum grounds It has a fabulous collection both of prehistory artifacts and items throughout the ages I especially like the porcelain collection,Positive
759,This is an excellent museum It is huge If you spend even a minimal amount of time looking through the exhibits you will need a full day to see them However you can find the highlights in a couple of hours Some of the most spectacular exhibits for many Westerners are probably clustered around room 108 where the golden crown is located on the ground floor The restaurant is good but it has a limited Western menu and is rather expensive spaghetti with meat sauce and a soft drink for two was about 45000 KRW Be advised that if you have limited mobility you can probably get the taxi driver to take you into the parking structure beneath the museum from where you can take elevators or escalators directly into the museum without too much walking However the museum staff will not call a taxi for you You have to walk several blocks out the front of the museum to get to a main street from which you can catch a taxi to return,Negative
760,Get there by line 4 at Ichon station There are wonderful ground and multilevel floors with exhibits I am not a great lover of museums and got overwhelmed with this museum,Negative
761,If youre interested in Korean history then this museum is great for you  Its a big museum that takes a few hours to walk around Its also free entry,Positive
762,Beautiful place to visit I \xe2\x99\xa1 museums so trying to visit every national museum whenever I get a chance to go If you are in Korea I strongly recommend this museum in Seoul There is also great museum to visit in Kyongju Folk museum in Suwom is also great place to visit   Very easy excess from the metro station and if the weather is good you can walk around the museum as well I have post some photos and hope you all can ejoy them,Positive
763,Good English descriptions of exhibits covering a wide and varied historical perspective of Korean history and culture Superb pottery dating back to the 12th century Well worth visiting for anyone who wants to learn about Korean culture and history  many Koreans appreciate this museum too and take their children on weekends to learn about their unique heritage That is a sure sign of its significance and value A must see while in Seoul,Positive
764,When traveling with kids it is always good to know where to go with them if the weather is not so good The kids museum at the National Museum of Korea is one great option Just be aware there are time slots which can be either booked online or on site Once your time slot is over you have to leave Depending on the amount of people going in you can go in a second time but this might be dependent on your time and date not in heigh season presumably Kids can enjoy and learn hands on while at the museum,Positive
765,This museum is amazing The place is simply massive It includes exhibits not only from Korea but from all over Asia We spent a half day here and only left because we were getting hungry You could easily spend an entire day Admission is free and the location is easy to access from the metro,Positive
766,Like so many attractions in Seoul the Natl Museum is free Its large and clean with air conditioning and free wifi making it a perfect stop in a busy day of sightseeing Obviously it doesnt compare to some of the worlds greatest but you cant beat the price,Positive
767,Large and extensive collection of artifacts and details about Koreas long history Good for people who have an interest andor want to learn more about Korea Commit a few hours as it is quite large,Positive
768,Dont miss this opportunity to visit the national Museum in Seoul Really it is well organised and the way they present the history is wonderful,Positive
769,This was a really great experience I learned a lot about Korean history and culture from walking through this museum If you are only in Seoul a short time or if you do not have a historical perspective already this is a mustexperience attraction,Positive
770,Not much of a museum visitor but went with family and surprisingly enjoyed it The museum was able to grab my attention as the flow was telling a interesting story in time,Positive
771,Reached easily via an underground travellator from the nearby Metro station the National Museum is certainly worth a visit The permanent exhibits range over three beautiful floors the ground level being particularly pleasing aesthetically and architecturally The Museum is free to everyone It includes an terrific loungerelaxation area and delightful grounds to stroll and spectacular views on one side,Positive
772,Impressive array of Korean historical and religious exhibits Beautiful Buddist sculptures and statues,Positive
773,August is a v hot month and to escape the heat we visited the museum At 2pm we went on a guided tour that lasted 15 hrs It was great esp since there were only 2 of us Guide was an elderly Korean gentleman who piqued our interest about Korean history so much so that we bought A Brief History of Korea at the museum shop,Positive
774,National Museum of Korea is subdivided into many areas Exhibiting the different dynasty that ruled over Korea,Neutral
775,close by the castle the museum was one of the highlights of our tour you can buy a ticket for both given you a discount loved the way that the museum was laid out which made it very easy to view all the contents which covered over five floors,Positive
776,A place to get all the important facts and much much more if interested about the Korean peninsula since palaeolithic era until today History and art in one place I went there with the idea of spending one morning there and ended up spending 8 hours  A huge collection Dont worry if planning on engaging on a long visit  theres a restaurant with a huge selection of Korean but also international dishes The place itself is quite cool too And there is a huge park outside with a pond and a some pagodas and theres another museum a smaller one in the same park Huge great and beautiful  just go,Positive
777,Remarkable collections covering every periods in the Korean history plus items from other parts of the world too I started the visit sometime around 10 in the morning and when the museum to close at 6 there were still rooms I have not yet covered Highly recommended for historylovers,Positive
778,Except for the location where theres not much things to eat or do around National Museum of Korea will be able to give you a great insight on Asian art Its a very modern building with small but serene garden front and back which you can take a small walk around Its even free Theres sometimes other art or photography exhibitions organized which you must pay to enter The exhibitions they hold were mostly good,Positive
779,Free museum that tells the young history of Korea I learned a lot from its time lined exhibit There was a free photos shots we could take and print for ourselves ie I love Korea,Positive
780,Lots to see and learn Is a good place to visit with the family You can easily sent hours admiring everything in the museum,Positive
781,Its great way to learn about their history but dont do it on a weekend There are just so many people running all over the place,Positive
782,The whole museum is very massive and entrance fee is free Grand history and magnificent treasures Long live the Korea So the rate is 5 point 5 Wait But the explanation words are so small that even Korean people dont know what is treasure or replica When I watched the national treasure one Korean woman said Oh it is good replica And my eyes were tired to read that tiny words So I would rate 1,Positive
783,The building of the national museum of Korea is magnificent and its free besides the special exhibitions The reason why I came there is Im interested in the contemporary history of Korea and I thought there must be some exhibitions about the miracle of Han river the democratic movement etc But at last I found the content of the museum is only about the ancient history and its items,Positive
784,I could sum up the content in this museum as the history of Korea dating from items found by archaeologists hundreds or thousands of years ago the history of civilisations throughout the centuries art and sculptures and Buddhist statues from various time periods etc Its all quite interesting and much more history than my own country can display but it gets a bit overwhelming after a while Well worth a visit especially since its free but while you could spend 2 hours there you could see enough in half an hour to satisfy you,Positive
785,The arrival there is made very simple and easy so much so you can easily visit with whatever weather The park surrounding the huge museum is beautiful and a lot of local kids enjoyed it I at first visited the right now ongoing exhibition on Sinan Shipwreck and found it very interesting along with impressing worth the 5000 won I payed to see treasures of a past time From there I moved into the free National Museum where you could probably spend a day or several taking in the huge collection I ended up picking specific rooms to go to in order not to lose myself in the huge establishment There are walking tours at certain times  I decided to explore on my own Once you enter the rooms of the displays quiet surrounds you along with beautiful pieces of art It was a bit distracting with the loud children but then again that is nothing is new either There are rooms upon rooms filled with treasures  the signs are in Korean English Chinese and Japanese Outside the spaces are several bathrooms and places where you can have a drink of water The building is huge and a wonderful trip all together Only thing I have to admit is that the architecture part didnt really overwhelm me  the interior is beautiful and clear cut the outside look is okay  PS Was lucky enough to even catch a live performance before the entrance to the museum,Positive
1058,For a pleasant afternoon of history and art this is a great venue for foreigners to visit From the welcoming flowers at the entrance the scenic gardens gift shops and the vast selection of history there is something for just about everyone There is an ease in which you can stroll thru the exhibits read the placards yes they are in English too and take in the vast and rich collections on display Several stories tall you might find that you need a break after a bit; they have a small cafe to enjoy refreshments and to sit and catch your breath I would say that if you read placards and keep an even pace you can do all three floors in an afternoon The gardens are great for a stroll and you can meander over to the other museum on the grounds Check their website for special exhibits and shows Oh and if youre worried about finding the National Museum it is quick walking distance to the subwaytry right at the entrance Head to Ichon station and have fun,Positive
1059,I really didnt read about the Korean history but when I visited the museum I learned a lot However the museum was so empty and I felt sad about it,Negative

1061,Another grand installation in Seoul displaying Korean history in a grandeur setting But the facility is not wheel chair friendly,Negative
1062,It is so pleasing to get access to such a great museum for free Anyone interested in the origins of the nation will learn a great deal There is a guided tour in English that commences at 2PM and is highly recommended Our guide was very passionate and the tour went to 4PM with great explanations of various aspects of Korean culture We were so pleased and keen to contribute at the end we decided to patronise the lovely caf\xc3\xa9 and enjoy a bit of Korean cuisine,Positive
1063,A large modern museum with plenty of ancient Korean exhibits over three floors Plenty of restrooms cafe and gift shop,Positive
1064,The national museum is worth a look it displays alot of history about their dynasty and cultural and religious artifacts Its 3 levels and have escalators end of each level It also has some displays of other cultures that existed over the years Its airconditioning and quite comfortable to walk around,Positive
1065,This is a very very large Museum That said the display space was about normal Each floor of galleries has its own emphasis The shop has many wonderful gift ideas Admission is free of charge Now the grounds and the view up to Namsan are spectacular,Positive
1066,Do consider spending a few hours to appreciate the different sections of this spacious museum Artefacts are rich in historical value Consider getting the audio guide to help you understand better An educational trip which you can make on your own By subway Jungang Line Ichon Stn 150 m towards Yongsan Family Park from Exit 2 or Line 4 Ichon Stn 150 m towards Yongsan Family Park from Exit 2 source englishvisitseoulnet,Positive
1067,Worth seeing for the facility alone frankly Very spacious and many interesting displays We only had about 2 hours not really enough but still got a lot out of the visit Definitely a top attraction from the places we visited in Seoul especially as we had rain part of the day,Positive
1068,I have yet to go inside because of time but I really enjoyed staying outside in the plaza and park The cantilever frames the axis and really is a nice place to chill with family,Positive
1069,I recommend the English speaking tours which are conducetd by volunteers Check with website for the scheduled tours,Positive
1070,Lots of beautiful pieces from Korean history and arts buddhas celadon lacquered boxes etc Beautiful grounds as well Restaurant serves Italian pasta as well as Korean food,Positive
1071,This building and the grounds are fantastic Probably the best thing that we saw in Seoul The artwork and historical treasures are amazing Most of the descriptions of the works are in English Allow yourself at least a day to do this place maybe more if you are into antiquities There is food available and caters to Western tastes As in all of Korea the toilets are spotless,Positive
1072,Impressive building and exhibits Exhibits are extensive and well presented with most interpretive signs in Korean and English There is much to be learned from a visit here Admission is free,Positive
1073,We had a 7am family photoshoot here with a professional photographer and found the surroundings of the museum to be very beautiful and well maintained Clearly the city takes a great pride in its museum The scale of the enormous buildings are also something else to behold  truly impressive Unfortunately we didnt get to go into the museum itself as we had to leave at 9am but the surround park is definitely worthwhile as a visit,Positive
1074,The National Museum in Ichon is housed in a nice building with a decent view of Namsan but the displays are fairly boring If you want to see some of the more beautiful artifacts medieval Korea produced Id recommend the Leeum between Itaewon and Hangangjin stations,Positive
1075,Anyone interested in the history of Korea this is the place to visit I had a great time exploring the exhibits It had 3 floors and a place to eat at the top floor,Positive
1076,you can start in national museum of Korea from the stone time to before smart phone a little time its great place to know the area history not only Korea history,Positive

1078,Impressive building free of charge and quite organized There are few good coffee shops inside the museum with good views prices are affordable considering free entrance to a good museum,Positive
1079,This museum is full with korean history and many cultural things from ancestors is showed there I remember there are a few buildings  exhibition and museum We can choose what to see first But since the area is so large better to prepare your feet to walk Theres free drinking water inside so dont worry if u get exhausted,Positive
1080,Free admission The little convenience stores on site dont jack up the price of good by much Dont miss the outdoor sections as well if you come during the springsummerfall They were very beautiful especially the dragon waterfall,Positive
1081,Be prepared to walk as its huge with 3 floors of exhibits Do check if the special exhibits are open as they close on some days Its free and very well maintained We were tired so only managed to see 112 floors on our own Would probably be better if we paid for a guide Entrance is FOC,Positive
1082,One of the most impressive museums I ever visited the accessibility of the museum is great near a metro station The museum is huge you can spend here 45 hours easily I really recommend the Calligraphies sections of the museum there are some amazing art works there and also informative explanation on that unique art I were there on a weekend during the summer vacation and it was great to see there local Korean families couples and friends enjoy the museum silently and seriously as part of their culture it was one example out of many to the uniqueness of the Korean people,Positive
1083,Took the subway to the nearby station and its a short mostly sheltered walk to the museum The gardens surrounding the museum are really pretty in spring it would be good to take a walk around before going inside the museum itself  Inside the museum is as expected  many many artifacts from Korea dating back to the Stone Age I didnt get an audio guide but reading the info boards sufficed for me The museum itself is huge with exhibits from different parts of Asia However it can get disjointed at some points because of the abrupt transitions between different geographical areas I spent 15 hours in the museum but it was definitely too little if youre interested in exploring the whole museum If you want to explore everything thoroughlyare a history buff a day is recommended Otherwise a half a day visit should be enough,Positive
1084,Great view outside the Museum and even inside they offer English tour guide and give brief story how once Korea was united Youll learn more on their culture and traditions Josean Era and Era before that Koreans are very artistic and stylist from the very beginning Dont forget that taking pictures are not allowed in other parts inside the Museum,Positive
1085,The National Museum of Korea is huge and full of every Korean artifact imaginable Its a rainy day location for sure Your enjoyment of this museum will depend on how well you appreciate Korean art but if you are bored in one section you can walk a long distance to get to another section Definitely check out the celadon pottery area,Positive
1086,If you have 45 hours then it really deserves to pay a visit Firstly the museum itself is great secondly it exhibits a pretty comprehensive collection that starts from Paleolithic Era to Joseon Dinasty If you want to know more about Koreas history then its a must,Positive
1087,Nothing new and grande here if you have been to other ceramic museums in Asia with that being said they often have guest exhibits that can really turn a rainy day into a wonderful day Keep your eye peeled for whats on guest display,Positive
1088,Great for rainy days Lots of art and they offer multiple languages tours but when I was there he tour was a coupe hours so I took the self guided tour and payed 3000 won for the recorded I wouldnt recommend it you can walk around the museum by yourself,Positive
1089,Visit on rainy day interesting facts and items about Koreas history Helps a lot to know Koreas history beforehand,Positive
1090,We spent 12 day here exploring this museum and its lovely grounds  Considering the free admission price this is definitely the best attraction for the money in all of Seoul  Dont miss the nearby Hangul Museum which has many Korean language exhibits also free,Positive
1091,Museum had lots of artifacts of the history of Korea not so much with paintings but with stone and gold work as well as some jewels Depending on your interest can spend an hour to several hours Grounds are spread out and can find plenty of places to sit and enjoy the garden areas,Positive
1092,Every time I travel I make sure to look for museums This trip is definitely no exception To say that one appreciates the Korean culture is an understatement because the culture is complex as their history To fully appreciate them one must be openminded free from stereotypes and with a deep sense of craving to understand what makes them who they are today The best place to get this wealth of information is their National Museum This place is kids friendly ,Positive
1093,I must confess that my knowledge of S Korea was limited to what we see on TV so it was a surprise to see the rich customs tradition and history in one location It was a pleasant eye opener and a great way to learn about this wonderful country and its people Well worth a visit,Positive
1094,It was the most amazing and knowledgeable museum about Asian countries history there was different way to introduce the information by pictures or TV with vedio in korean and English it was for free,Positive
1095,Very nice half day excursion Good restaurant food as well no alcohol unfortunately what a difference a nice glass of wine would have made Take the metro to this location We thought we could walk as the map shows various roads but the parkmuseum is surrounded on three sides by an enormous US government property which we ended up walking around as the roads are inside the enclave Only access is at the south end,Positive
1096,The museum far exceeded my expectation I had less than 90 minutes and would have loved at least another hour There was so much to seeand the exhibits were so varied The grounds were beautiful but it was raining so I didnt get to stroll My favorite exhibit was the statues of the Buddhas The gift shop was excellent I would have loved to have tea in the cafe and take a leisurely look at more of the exhibits,Positive
1097,It is an absolute delight to go through the Museum with thousands of exhibits not just of Korean history but of civilisation as a whole The Koreans have done a fantastic job in excavating and preserving their history and there are so many museums in Korea that have this on display for the general public I am grateful to the patronage of so many donors who have researched and donated their priceless artifacts to the museum It is a huge place you can spend hours or days going through it I am grateful to the Korean government for its lavish contribution in creating it maintaining it and keeping it free Just kept thinking of the destruction in Palmyra as I was going through this amazing place,Positive
1098,From the aircraft ship displays gifsbtif monuments outside to the massive and impressive museum inside this is a MUST SEE on your trip to S Korea The museum will take you about 4 hours to walk through It explains all wars Korea has been through starting back in the pre historic time running through to present Korea has an extensive history which we found very interesting,Positive
1099,High class Museum Very modern design easy navigation through the various rooms and topics large enough not to be crowded concise explanations in English too free yes  and fantastic items on show It was a pleasure all the way visiting this Museum Note If you just want to walk through only stopping briefly in front a few spectacular pieces I guess about 15 hrs are necessary A more quiet visit may need about twice as much Id advise at least 2 hrs and be selective as there are very diverse topics exposed that are not likely to be of interest for everybody,Positive
1100,The museum itself is housed in a gorgeous and enormous modern building I enjoyed the layout of the museum that really walked you through the history of the peninsula from a prehistory perspective to the influences throughout the peninsula and how Korea became what it is today I think the museum did an outstanding job of mapping out this journey Get the museum map so you can make sure you follow it Give yourself plenty of time We didnt have time to go through the entire museum as I would have liked I think 4 hours would have been plenty of time to go through each floor 3 floors  Someone said that the museum was FREE Its not You pay on the outside and then enter Theres no one there taking tickets Ive noticed that Koreans are very trustworthy and use the honor system The cost is about 13 USD or so well worth it and in my opinion an awesome price  The museum also had a great cafe and area with small restaurants We had coffee but if we didnt have reservations for a late lunch we would have totally ate there They even had gourmet hotdogs which looked awesome  This is definitely a must see museum and another place to take amazing pictures inside and outside,Positive
1101,Lovely building in a gorgeous peaceful setting Art and history are displayed thoughtfully throughout the museumopen and inviting Items on display often took ones breath away  stunning I took a tour with a museum volunteer in English which was chock full of facts about Korea and its history,Positive
1102,We enjoyed the Childrens section of this museum and the main exhibits were a nice look at some of Koreas history Best of all the museum is free,Positive
1103,This modern building houses the collection from the very beginnings to the last king All items are presented professionally and you can get an audio tour that highlights some main exhibits Nice cafeteria at the top level,Positive
1104,This place is one of my favorites to study Korean cultures In the museum you will be able to see lots of old things like boat jewelry statues and etc,Positive
1105,Art and relics are astounding Well laid out Gift shop is superb Had a great time viewing prehistoric relics to well preserved national treasures,Positive
1106,The National Museum of Korea is great place to spend an hour or so exploring Koreas history The outside area that leads up and surrounds the museum is beautiful and serene Inside the museum there is a vast array of stunning history pieces and what makes it even better is that the museum is free They do have special monthly that do cost money but the history museum is free to the public,Positive
1107,Recommend visiting the national museum to exposure yourself to the history and national treasures of Korea Nice gift shop too,Positive
1108,Very focused on Korea China  Japan with not many artifacts from other parts of the world unlike peer museums in Tokyo or UK for example However it was still fine for me as I was only looking to learn about Korean history and they did a good job at that,Positive
1109,Worth a visit to this lovely free museum Easy to get to on the metro  three floors charting the history and artefacts of Korea  so in a very real sense its a national museum It concentrates solely on Korea  but I loved it it was spacious  we went on a Saturday and it seems that is a school day as it was full of children  who surprisingly were not that well behaved  the space seemed to encourage them to run riot which was a bit surprising  The exhibits are a combination of historical artefacts modern media and IT and its very well balanced  Id like the chance to go again Its set in a large park which was also nice to explore and its close to the metro  like everything else in Seoul  its well connected,Positive
1110,The museum is very nice clean and neat Entrance is for free to the museum and have scheduled free english tours,Positive
1111,THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF KOREAONE OF ASIAS GREAT MUSEUMS  This is a truly amazing museum set up in a very large functional building of contemporary design Its exhibits are arranged in various period galleries \xe2\x80\x93 covering prehistory and ancient history of Korea medieval and early modern history calligraphy and painting Asian art as well as Korean sculpture and arts The Prehistory and Ancient History Gallery starts with the Paleolithic and Neolithic Periods and covers the ascent of various Korean kingdoms up to the Balhae kingdom Among the exhibits are ancient farm implements clay pottery of considerable geometrical accuracy a range of weapons including steel swords daggers spearheads arrowheads and axes There is a beautifullycarved stone dagger as well as stone tools wood implements and the like from the Bronze Age Among other exhibits of that period are a milling stone to grind acorn and an early example of a dugout canoe Koreas Unified Silla Period is represented by a very ornamental gold crown of the royalty of that period Its exquisite design and the high quality of workmanship would have done credit to a more contemporary product There is also a range of jewellery including necklaces and earrings that had once graced the queens and princesses of that era Of particular interest are gold silver bronze and iron vessels recovered from Silla Dynasty tombs A particularly rich haul has been from the tomb of King Huryeong of the Baekje period This section of the museum has well over 7500 carefullyselected artifacts of exceptional quality  The Medieval and Early Modern History Gallery has artifacts dating back to the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties There is a very interesting section on Koreas Hangeul alphabet and the metal printing types to print documents in that language In that respect Korean culture had achieved considerable precedence over Europe The exhibits include several ancient documents in Hangeul The Dharani Sutra woodblock printing technique of an earlier age is said to date back to rhe eighth century and is claimed to be \xe2\x80\x9cthe oldest existing woodblock printed scripture in the world\xe2\x80\x9d All credit to Korean culture  A section on the Joseon period showcases massive wooden furniture Interestingly they had separate furniture for men and for women in that day and age  The section on Asian art has the finest artifacts from India and Southeast Asia Central Asia China and Japan Among the highquality religious statues from India is an exceptional one of God Siva and his consort Parvati In the Chinese section are a series of paintings laid out side by side A closer look however shows the water flowing in the rivulet across all five paintings Boats ply on the water while a little bird flies across the paintings These are very cleverly made movies It is utterly brilliant  There is an awesome collection of Chinese porcelain obtained from the Sinan shipwreck The ship was carrying exquisite pottery from China for use by Japanese temples when it was wrecked  The section on porcelainware must be the envy of most other museums in the world There is Buncheongware celadon as well as white porcelain Particularly stunning is a celadon Ewer featuring a mythical creature with the body of a fish and the head of a dragon This section also has audiovisual presentations on quality porcelain craftsmanship  Equally fascinating is the section on Buddhist art and sculpture Buddhism came to Korea during the Three Kingdoms period Some of the guilded metal statues of Buddha are of exceptional intricacy The Pensive Bodhisattvas are regarded by Koreans as \xe2\x80\x9cnational treasures\xe2\x80\x9d and are products of exceptional craftsmanship A large portrait of Buddha stretches from the floor to the ceiling That section also has Buddhist metalware Buncheongware and white porcelain Among the most amazing exhibits in the museum is a tenstorey pagoda from the Gyeongcheonsa Temple site It stretches almost from the ground floor to the roof of the museum and is intricately carved from granite  Digital and audio guides are available on rental These are in Korean English Chinese and Japanese There are also programmes for visitors of all ages from children onwards There is a childrens museum that offers educational programmes for them A library of reference works museum shops that sell cultural products restaurants cafes an 805seat theatre for cultural programmes free loan of strollers and wheel chairs for those who need them as well as toilets are among the facilities on offer The museums permanent collections are free for visitors while the special exhibitions are charged admission Parking for visitors cars is also charged The museum is closed on Mondays 1 January and on all holidays The visit was an emotionally rewarding experience Hormuz P Mama,Positive
1112,A good way to immerse in the cultural history of Korea Very big will take a lot of time Grounds are also good to spend some peaceful time,Positive
1113,Bring your walking shoes and thinking caps because theres a lot to walk and see here in Ichon dong They have exhibits on every period of Korean history from the Gogoryeo to the waning days of Joseon A very great rainy day activity as well The grounds are popular for people taking family photos as well,Positive
1114,I made the mistake of coming here on a Tuesday at first which was a fail because I didnt realize that Monday was a holiday and they close on Mondays but if Mondays are a holiday they close on the subsequent day So the place was closed and we spent the time exploring the grounds instead which was quite a lovely alternative as there were numerous gardens a pond and a couple of pagodas  So of course we came back the next day and proceeded to tour the museum This place is HUGE with 6 floors of galleries filled to brim with historical information I learned so much about calligraphy marriage ceremonies the different eras of Korea etc After a few hours and being only on the 3rd floor we were starting to become tired and bored so we decided to rest in this huge nice sunny room with couches everywhere before leaving  The museum is easily accessible from the subway theres a stop right outside the grounds and one of the exits takes you right up to the museum Admission is free as well so definitely feel free to come on multiple days as its hard to finish it in one especially if you LOVE history or if its rainy haha For me Im not much of a history nut so a few hours here was definitely sufficient for me,Positive
1115,The National Museum of Korea is huge The exhibition is very interesting but you might get bored after a few hours spent in the museum I would suggest to do the different exhibition in different days as the museum is free,Positive
1116,Travelled to the museum on a Sunday morning by taxi The Museum has English notes on most of the items The Artefacts are very interesting and the knowledge Gai ed most rewarding,Positive
1117,The National Museum of Korea occupied vast piece of land and was very well constructed with impressive opencourt before entering the museum Its 4 levels with an atrium in the center gave an attractive welcoming perspective of the museum and also simplified the setup of the different halls The treasures were well displayed and divided into different categories and with the assistance of the escalators moving around the museum was relatively easy There were clean toilets facilities in every floor The lobby of the museum has a giant video board to announce any message the management would like to post On our arrival from the cruise ship the board displayed the welcome of our group,Positive
1118,The museum is free to enter and has a small recreational area around it to walk This museum introducts you to the history  culture of the country however after visitng major world museums i wasnt wowed There were several interesting pieces but it turned out those werent really Korean and were brought in either by Chinese or on Indian trading ships They have a very good souvenir shop with some nice ceramics,Positive
1119,The museum was well maintained They definitely keep it updated and is quite interactive The displays were impressive,Positive
1120,This museum is worldclass and by far the most enormous and exquisite museum I ever been to With the perfect surrounding of the green this place offers knowledge and serenity for its visitors Its amazing how such place amplify the locals and tourist with knowledge about the history of Korea through its heritage and culture The cafes range of food is amazing and tasteful and you can take so much photo of the garden This is highly recommended and its a regret for anyone not to come here,Positive
1121,It is quite a walk from the nearby Ichon metro station The museum is really too large for just one visit so better take a leaflet and choose the items you want to see The museum spans all of Koean history from the Paleolithic onwards I particularly liked the Buddhas on the third floor Access is free English explanations are rather limited There are different museum shops on on each floor the main one is on the first floor The is a nearby the National Hangeul Museum Could not visit that one though,Positive
1122,I went there with my family It was so great to see the pieces of Korean history I did not have much time to see all of this this place but I had great time,Positive
1123,Really is a must visit Spacious grounds and museum exhibits youd be wandering around going wow wow wow,Positive
1124,This is a rather nice and super spacious museum near the center of Seoul It is accessible by many buses and the Metro I stress its size again because any shops and museums in Asia are so tiny and the walking area is so limited that the space and freedom to walk around and enjoy the artifacts is so refreshing Most exhibits have are in English in addition to the standard Korean If there is a group of more than ten in English there will be a guide to walk you around If you are in Korea and looking for something to do head down to the National Museum of Korea and its free,Positive
1125,National Museum of Korea is a good place to visit if you are a visitor like me who spent a fortnight therel; the admission is for free and it holds exhibits from all over Asia and collections from private donors,Positive
1126,nice surroundings  park  waterfall  views also suitable for kidsoutside park with playing grounds nearby,Positive
1127,It is worthwhile to visit this museum You will see the history of the former Korean Kingdom and the development of the people Please visit the place next door as well Admission is free of charge You can have accupakket of coffee after the visit as well,Positive
1128,The museum is really huge and pretty For people interested in history this place is a mandatory point to visit There are explanations in Korean and in English and there are tours available,Positive

1131,Korean National Museum is good place for visit for knowledge of AsiaYou know much more about Asian history,Positive
1132,Much to see here You could easily spend a day enjoying this gem; from ancient times to modern day Korea The building itself is part of the exhibit It must be glorious when the flowers and gardens are in bloom,Positive
1133,Likes the park with the view to Namsan Tower A place where there is something to discover for everyone,Positive
1134,This was on our agenda as part of our last minute trip to Seoul and one of the best places to visit Step back into history of the Korean history very rich in culture as well For all my korean drama loving friends this would provide a good lineage and background on some of the dramas depicting the past  We took the free English tour and we were brought through to almost 2 hours of very interesting facts and lessons something which we might not have gathered if we had just walked around the museum Our guide was a retiree and his English was very easy to understand It is amazing to see his passion as he brought us through  The main exhibition hall was free for the public to enter Noted also that there was a childrens museum and a special exhibition paid that probably changes depending on the theme You would probably need 23 days to finish everything otherwise just review the map and zoom in on the sections that interest you,Positive
1135,This museum is huge and provides a lot of information I wish more was in english but we enjoyed it You need a few hours or a couple days to get through all of it fully,Positive
1136,Huge collection of artifacts from the past You can easily spend many hours in the National Museum of Korea,Positive
1137,The building is beautiful as is the outdoor area However I am not a true museum fan and not really my cup of tea This is no Louve or MOMAand unless there is something you really want to see at the exhibit and assuming your time is limited while visiting Seoul I would pass Of course this is coming from a normally nonmuseum lover so please take this with a grain of salt,Positive
1138,There a numerous museums in Seoul and this is a must seegreat history and wonderful artifacts although not all of the information is in EnglishFree admission to main museum and there was a special exhibition while we were there on the history of Buddha which we paid a fee to enter and was worth itSubway to Ichon Station Line 4 Exit 2 and museum is connected via a underpass,Positive
1139,Easy to navigate and pretty interesting We did a quick run through as we did not get the audio guides and there is limited information in English There is much more info in Korean Give yourself an hour and a half for a quick visit and of course longer if need,Positive
1140,If youre a history buff go for it But get a tour guide to explain what do the structures mean and all Like any palace musuem there is always an interesting story I would definitely go again but with a tour guide,Positive
1141,Been to Korea numerous times and never went to the National Museum so I decided to pay it a visit on a rainy afternoon The signs are not very good but the historical documents inside are fascinating Most of the old books  documents are written in traditional Chinese characters  which I can understand  There was a deed that a couple sold themselves into slavery and another document laid out the warranty on the building of a castle A fantastic map in Chinese characters  so call world map  drawn in Korea was mind blowing too,Positive
1142,This is a great day tripit is located right off the Subway exit with great directions The view of the Namsan tower on the backside was nice There is a cafe as well There are lots of exhibits and a lot to see It was a bit overwhelming but it was neat to learn about Korean history If I had more time I would have taken a guided tour,Positive
1143,My children 15 13 and 10 and I spent about 2 hours here It could take 12 day to thoroughly viewing and reading everything However weve been to so many museums in Asia already so we skipped many parts of this museums We only viewed the Korean history Its not only big and beautiful but its also free to the public We enjoyed our 2 hours there,Positive
1144,a bit of a distance from other sites Also a bit of a hike from the station even though station is meant for museum Simply beautiful grounds and really well done attraction A place you should visit while in Seoul,Positive
1145,I really like coming to the National Museum First its free to the public Thats totally awesome  It has many cultural and historical items worth seeing Nearby is a park and small food shop which cheap food I really recommend to come here  They finish building the underground walkway from metro to here Its beautiful,Positive
1146,The place is so vast and if youre into history you should visit this place You will learn not only about Korea but also other countries I guess this is one of the biggest museum in the world,Neutral
1147,The museum entrance was free at the time of our visit which was an unexpected bonus  As the title suggests it is a very large museum  allocate at least half a day to explore it in its entirety You can see pretty much all of korean history there chronologically organized on the bottom floor topically on the second Me and my husband had a great time but we had only two hours which made for a hasty end to the visit  There is also a childrens room and exhibition inside the museum so you can also bring your kids there without fear of boredom,Positive
1148,There is loads to see in this museum so much that I actually decided to take a full afternoon to see only the permanent exhibits session The museum is easily accessible by subway The permanent exhibit is full of interesting artefacts The admission to the permanent exhibit is free of charge and there are audio guides available for a reasonable price Definitely an amazing visit while in Seoul,Positive
1149,This is a great place to visit and should definiltely be included in any visitors itinerary The coolest thing is the exact replica of the Korean presidents desk where you can get a photo of yourself there There are tons of other exhibits there so allow time to see everything,Positive
1150,The museum is HUGE and very impressive Dont be intimidated there are so many resting areas throughout the entire museum if you need to give your legs a break  English audio tour was good to have but there was no way we were listening to every piece  Covers all of korean ancient history and has multiple floors arts sculptures privatedonated collections on the upper floors,Positive
1151,Came here in autumn and it was really pretty Im sure it will be as pretty during the other seasons too The museum grounds are massive you could take a walk around the lake and take in the scenery before entering the building Accessible by subway and if I recall correctly admission is free Lots of artifacts on the history of South Korea that dates back centuries,Positive
1152,Most subway is Line 4 Ichon There is underpass linking the subway to about 100m away from the museum entrance a nice thought for rainy or snowy days The museum has three floors and many sits for you to rest it is very big and free drinking water at each corners Korean history on Level 1 History of its links to Japan and China in Level 3,Positive
1153,Interesting for one who is learning about some of Koreas history Was a little confused at some parts as it felt that other asian countries such as Japan made more of an appearance that Korean history There was drinking water everywhere which was nice when taking a short break from viewing beautiful items,Positive
1154,It has all Korean history  Lots of National Treasure But entrance is free as of Nov 1st 2015  The entrance should be at least 10USD If you are interested in Korean buddhism history from prehistoric era this place will be perfect  You will need one hole day At least half day  ,Positive
1155,If it is rainy day or even beautiful on it worth it because park near museum is beautiful Museum itself is very vivid Typical stuff like ceramics arts caligraphy buddhas war equipment etc,Positive
1156,This is one of the biggest museum of Korea It is needed at least 4 hours at minimal to have a good view of all exibitions You can find very important aspects of Korean History,Positive
1157,Its rare to be impressed by the exposition of Stone Age objects and it is only first hall of this collection of historical miracles The creators of the exposition prove that all the objects here are honorable treasures They prove that they love the history and want the visitors to be involved in this exciting journey through the time Really worth be seen It is even sad that it is free of charge,Positive
1158,Check this out This place has many floors A lot of stairs but there are escalators too It aslo has a cool tea house Try the chestnut drink Also thus museum had a gardenMy favorite floor was the bottom where there is a big budda,Positive
1159,Was taken during my business trip to Korea very interesting indeed well worth a visit if you happen to be in the local area,Positive
1160,The Koreans are very well known for their Love of country  this National Museum is a proud testament to that A huge infrastructure a well curated collection I can spend a whole day just walking through the collections A nice museum cafe  huge museum store awaits your visit I just love museum stores,Positive
1161,The museum itself is gorgeous and well maintained Beautiful building and impressive technology and overall look We werent as impressed with the content inside however Although there is a wide variety there wasnt so much historical context provided and we felt we didnt really learn enough The main floor was far better than the 2nd or 3rd There was also quite a bit of information in Korean but there seemed to be lacking some in English An ok trip but I wouldnt recommend it if youre pressed for time I enjoyed the war memorial much more,Positive
1162,Went here on a rainy day to kill time Some interesting and educational exhibits Bring along your passport as deposit for the audio guide which can be rented cheaply think it was 1000 won,Positive
1163,Loved the museum a very large building with tons of space felt like the exhibitions were a bit exclusive very clean and nice Also visited temporary Buddhist exhibition near the museum which was awesome Do recommend,Positive
1164,I spent about three hours here and saw all three floors Take metro line 4 in direction of Oido and get off the Ichon stop exit 2 There is an underground path that takes you directly to the museum Once above ground the museum is right in front of you Its free Plenty of seating throughout the visit so you can rest in between exhibits,Positive
1165,I went to here next week and theres a nice museumMany exhibits in a modern building with many children and their parentsIf you are hungry you also can have lunch here just more expensive than outside And I also met a couple on a bunch to a picture from Indiareally art dateAnd near the outsidetheres a park thats a family park exactlyIf you want you can go picnic with your family members,Positive
1166,I found this to be very interesting It is a very large museum and its beautiful Learned things I didnt know about the Korean culture If you enjoy history this is a must,Positive
1167,This museum is a dont miss on your itinerary First this modern building has a very interesting design Of course its the exhibits that count I spent most of my time in the extended gallery that displayed artifacts from the paleolithic to bronze age It was so clearly laid out and seeing the progression in mans skills and art over that period was fascinating The best exhibit of its kind that I have ever seen The explanations in English were very good but it is still worth paying for the headphones as the explanations were more fulsome,Positive
1168,i like museum and art i spend my time at musical this time  there are hangul museum on the right side,Positive
1169,This is truly one of the great national museums of the world It covers the entirety of Korean history plus has exhibits from China Japan India Central  Southeast Asia a large gallery of donated items including an ancient Greek bronze helmet a gallery of items retrieved from the Sinan Shipwreck stone and porcelain galleries and a gallery of metalwork and Buddhist sculpture There is a park of large stone sculptures outside The highlight of the museum is probably the four Silla gold crowns displayed in several different galleries While it normally takes me almost a full day to photograph a Chinese provincial museum for my Chinese and World History website I spent two full days photographing this museum It is the single best historic attraction in Korea and one of the best in all Asia,Positive
1170,The building and the park impressed me the most even if they have an impressive collections of various aspects of the history Artifacts shown gives a good exposure to all of the Korean peninsulas history from the days humans first the feet on the ground to the present date Well at least until 1950s  A pity too many explanations of the artifacts shown where in Korean only With more info in English Im sure I would have appreciated it more,Positive
1171,Korea Museum and Strolling  If you like more than two above you definitely want to visit Take a blue line4 subway and take off at Ichon Station,Positive
1172,im sure if i had visited this museum first i would had enjoyed but seeing as i had visited the Gyeonbukgung museum i had already an heard a lot about the main exhibit theres a really awesome small scale 3D map of Seoul and you get to walk over it its just fantastic theres various small scale models of old korean neighborhoods its just fatastic,Positive
1173,We enjoyed touring the National Museum of Korea What was particularity facilitating to me where the Korean treasures such as the Silla gold crown and the Celedon porcelain We learned a lot about Korean history culture and arts at the museum,Positive
1174,Really like this museum It is an easy walk from the palace if you are trying to do all the touristy things at the same time The museum works its way through a lot of Korean history in a fun way We spent a few hours in there as there is so much to read and see The museum isnt so big you dont know where to go and a guide might be useful but we found it was great regardless,Positive
1175,Beautiful building and well laid out Progresses chronologically through the history of Korea The descriptions are a bit repetitive and would have been nice to have more details  More artefacts art sculpture and diversity would have been nice but I had feeling much of what should be in this museum is in China and Japan Many school classes visit this place so rooms can get crowded but not for long There is small cafeteria tucked half way between the 1st and 2nd floor good view and worth visit,Positive
1176,My first impression was  WOW What a huge place SPACE Have been living in HK for a year where space is premium to see and be in this vast place I was overwhelmed And to be treated to a surprised openair traditional concert was a welcome bonus We quickly walked round one exhibition area had to get back onto the tour bus There was a food court where the price is reasonable and the food are delicious I highly recommend visitors to visit this place,Positive
1177,I have always love visiting musuems overseas to learn more about the history of the country so this place gets a thumbs up fr me Wished I had more time to spend here will definitely return again when I am in Korea,Positive
1178,It was nice to have a look into korean history It is easy to spend there hours Depends as always from the degree of interest,Positive
1179,The museum is worth visiting I lIked the architecture of the museum and the exhibitions too I could have stayed a total day,Positive
1180,Hope this should be the same as War Memorial National Museum Nice with inside and outside museum The Garden was nice here as well The Brothers hugging status its a reminder that war hurts us all,Positive
1181,Lovely that the museum is free to visit A lovely 3 level museum featuring very interesting artifacts The whole trip took me more than 2 hours because I enjoyed reading everything that was written on the exhibits descriptions are in English as well,Positive
1182,I always enjoy visiting museums and this one is no exception There are many halls exhibiting artefacts from the ancient past of Korea however I found it to get a little repetitive after a little while That being said I would absolutely recommend anyone to visit here if they visit Seoul,Positive
1183,As a Mexican it was pretty surprising and amazing to get to know Korean culture For me it was quite an experience to learn about Korean history in such an amazing place The walls of the National Museum of Korea shelter centuries of wisdom and magnificent historical pieces,Positive
1184,we went this museum no plan was so good Was so big than expected i feel like i need to know my culture And this is so helpful to me to know my culture was too big so maybe i need to visit here again later,Positive
1185,When I first arrived at the museum by foot it was huge in my opinion There is free admission to view the exhibit but there is also exhibits that you can pay to see There is lots of space outside as well Really clean building Depending on the day that you go it can be busy or empty,Positive
1186,Quite good  very big so you will need to allocate a few hours if you want to get around the whole place,Positive
1187,This is a big museum However I just visited the Korean season and the important life events The life events were really illuminating Thoroughly enjoyed the displays and the information Gave me an insight into their life I was restricted in time at the museum I wish that I had had more time to enjoy it,Positive
1188,It was very interesting viewing history from another part of the world Plan on spending quite a bit of time here,Positive
1189,Of all the museums Ive been to I recall most having witnessed some masterpieces that ppl read about in books The piece are what defines a museum for me and in all honesty Im trying to say this as nicely as I can I wasnt impressed There were a few pieces that caught my fancysome of the crowns and prints but there were too many unimpressive items on display I stopped counting the number of plates they had on display at50 I was most impressed with the actual museum because it is so huge and elaborate That one sitting Buddha was cool too because he had so much character,Positive
1190,So you know nothing of the history of Korea Well dont feel left out few do outside the peninsula Although its not as exciting as Japanese Shoguns and Samurai or Chinese walls to keep out Mongolian invaders Korean history has its sparkle as well The museum is vast and wellkept Its practically free considering the prices of museums in Europe and America There are gardens at the back of the building that are beautiful and quite peaceful,Positive
1191,This may be a free museum but its not lacking in exhibits There is so much to see here that during our year long stay in Korea we visited almost half a dozen times This museum has more than its fair share of Korean National Treasures which are well worth the visit alone The grounds are nice for a gentle stroll around if you start to get overwhelmed by the exhibits This museum also hosts special exhibits at different points of the year some of these charge but the ones we went to were worth the charge,Positive
1192,This museum is free But they do have a lot of materials Also the explanation is really good wellorganized and English friendly You can check out the history of Korea briefly and look around Korean Tradition too,Positive
1193,this is big museum and inside gwanghamun palace I am lucky as I visited here on 16 august  Korea celebrating independence day so admission fee was also free,Positive
1194,This is a very nice and FREE museum with a good collection of art and historical artifacts I spent most of my time on the first floor which takes you counterclockwise from the entrance on a complete tour of Korean history through the imperial period I had read Bruce Cumings Koreas Place in the Sun before arriving which is a history of Korea in the 20th century so he breezes right through the preceding millennia This museum was excellent for helping me flesh that out in my mind,Positive
1195,This museum has great history and art The main hall is free and there is a great mix of written explanation as well as media presentations,Positive
1196,Probably one of the most interactive museums Ive been too in a while A lot of the displays allowed you to pick things to listen to They had a water featureart feature in one of the rooms as well It was a really pretty place to be especially on a nice spring day I would definitely recommend,Positive
1197,Like any museums its very educational Lots of people  cons some tourists should control their children better a museum is not a play ground to run around and scream,Positive
1198,If youre wishing to know more about the history of Korea and see some beautiful artifacts I highly recommend a trip to this museum Many proud Koreans have donated their collections of artifacts to this museum,Positive
1199,Free national museum in Seoul Very nice with lots of Korean history stuff Celadon in 3rd floor and first floor 3 kingdoms hall are great After looking around the museum went to the foodcourt which is next to the museum shop I did not have a expectaion for this food court but it is better than I expected I quite liked simple plate Port curtlet The Museum shop has also many miniature products Very beautiful,Positive
1200,The National Museum is a vast place As with other very large museums like say the Met in New York its easy to exhaust yourself I highly recommend choosing a few areas of interest whether its ceramics calligraphy Buddhist art furniture or whatever and just visiting those targeted areas The gift shop is nice and has some highguality items on offer I can say from experience that the restaurant at the far end serves very nice desserts In addition the grounds are lovely and worth exploring if the weather is not too hot or too cold,Positive
1201,If you need anything to get interesting overview of Korean history check out the museum its free admission and its a very nice display of intricate Korean artifacts and history check it out I loved it,Positive
1202,This place is massive I was not as impressed as I was at the War Memorial but this museum is still impressive This museum will give you everything a little bit of everything about Korea From skeletons to potteries to buildings to monuments and everything in between,Positive
1203,Compared to the one in Taiwan I enjoyed this museum better Perhaps because it is free and layout is very organized they provide headset which has all informative information It was enjoyable two hour walk,Positive
1204,I loved how the museum was laid out It took you through Korean history through objects and art work The videos in between made it feel a little interactive and allowed some rest too We went on a Sunday afternoon and found it quite empty,Positive
1205,I spent a couple hours with my dad especially on the 2nd floor He is a lover of Chinese calligraphy so he was in heaven Dont miss the golden crowns of Silla on 1st floor and the Goryeo era pagoda,Positive
1206,Beautiful and spacious Museum with very interesting artifacts We had an English guide to help explain history of Korea Everyone should visit to learn to history of this beautiful country,Positive
1207,The National Museum of Korea is the largest museum in the country and definitely worth seeing even if theres a lot of similar stuff I had already seen at other museums including the National Palace Museum at Gyeongbokkung as well as the National Museum in Gyeonju; this one is the biggest and has the most comprehensive sweep of Korean history and culture Its large but you can probably do the museum in around two hours not including special exhibitions And you can get there by subway even if its a bit of a walk around 1520 minutes from the nearest station I do think the exterior of the building could be so much more interesting; it just looks like a big shoebox And the galleries named for major donors are a bit offputting in terms of flattering their vanity But this museum is definitely worth a visit if you can get there Note its wheelchairaccessible once you get inside the museum but you have to climb a long incline to get up to the entrance In any case make sure to see the giant pagoda in the middle of the museum,Positive
1208,I highly recommend this museum it is organized in a great way that takes you through the history of the Korean Land and its people Very good exhibits with plenty of English descriptions and dialogue I went midweek and it was not at all crowded Im sure the weekends are much busier A must see for museum lovers while in Seoul,Positive
1209,It is AWESOME if you want history BOOM you got it The Food is okay I guess But for history lovers it is going to be awesome,Positive
1210,If youre interested in knowing the history and legacy of Korea its a good place for you You will find chinese japanese and korea statues and artfacts 3 hours would be more than enough to explore the place,Positive
1211,A world class Museum where you can easily spend an entire day Many of the exhibits have descriptions in English and also a marker indicating if they are a national Treasure The building itself is impressive and the grounds are quite beautiful especially in the Spring Well worth a visit,Positive
1212,There is so much to see that you could easily spend the full day You can learn all about the history of Korea and the museum is very well maintained I found it to be very clean and well organized,Positive
1213,I learnt so much of Koreas history from this museum Everything is extremely easy to follow the exhibits were amazing It is also such a beautiful building We had been there 2 hours and if had absolutely flown by You should allow at least 12 day for a visit,Positive
1214,the museum is epic one of the largest in the world the only thing that I found some what annoying was that I did not understand the full scope of the pieces on display The english part has only the title while you can see the Korean section is saying way more Other than it is a pretty cool place to visit especially if the weather is bad or your plans got cancelled or if youre broke since its free,Negative
1215,It was a good chance for me to find out more about Korean cultureI love Korea and this trip more cool than I expected,Positive
1216,While the collection at this museum is fantastic and offers a great overview of Korean history the building is equally impressive and a lovely place to spend a few hours Even the cafeteria is attractive and the food is pretty good The museum especially the first floor is laid out very well and walks visitors through Korean history  explaining the Dynasties and highlighting important events and leaders The collection of artifacts is impressive  my kids particularly enjoyed seeing the various types of ancient money  If you have children be sure to check out the attached Childrens Museum as well reservations may be required here,Positive
1217,An excellent collection of Korean artifacts which are well laid out and displayed A visit here will give you an appreciation of the depth of Korean history and it is free You can wander around the extensive grounds and gardens outside and then continue your journey through the modern galleries within There is also a nice tea shop and good casual restaurant in the complex,Positive
1218,This is an exceptional facility with a very wide array of exhibits Korea is a very ancient land and this museum really helps you appreciate that It is well laid out and multiple languages,Positive
1219,Be warned it is closed on Mondays The National Museum is free and has a lot of beautiful artwork and artifacts If you are interested in Korean culture I would definitley go here If it is not raining I would take time to walk around the park in front of it If you have time and are studying Korean the hangul museum is really interesting It has exhibits on the creation of the hangul characters,Positive
1220,Excellent museum with Free admission The exhibits are pretty comprehensive good in learning their history,Positive
1221,The place was large and had quite a lot of things shown however most of it felt like they sort of just placed it behind glass and gave it a description No real storyline or interaction on the exhibits Felt pretty average too me,Positive
1222,If you love history like I do you will love this place you will be able to see the development of the Korean culture from the cave tims to the futuristic present they are now,Positive
1223,The place is just off the Ichon train station There is an underground path from the station to the Museum entrance so look for the signs The museum ground is huge From the outside it beats any of the palaces in grandeur and scale A huge lake is in front and the back is the Namsan tower There are plenty of displays about Korean history Theres even a nearby museum for the Korean language Inside are good cafes and restaurants So anyone can easily spend a whole day here if you are ok with the peace and quiet I was there on a weekday,Positive
1224,A nice spacious museum Wonderful Celadon and other style pottery The collection of ancient Asian pottery and artifacts recently recovered from a sunken ship is especially interesting,Positive
1225,Make sure to take a halfday for it Huge neat wellorganized loaded with very interesting objects of Korean heritage We were especially by the wellpreserved neolithic skeleton and the big Buddha carvings Great audiovisuals too Close to subway station there is one exit that gets you directly there,Positive
1226,Most travelers will only visit one museum one place one well if you really only have time to go to one I would go to this one It is huge There is a lot to see and the English guide was very helpful The temporary exhibit is always changing so I try to go every few months It is a great place to explore and learn about Korean history,Positive
1227,Very easy to go just get off at Ichon station and follow the sign Therere so many things to see I wish I have more time,Positive
1228,Very nice building and surroundings but the exhibition is very ordinary Nothing really spectacular If you have limited time you can skip it,Negative
1229,we had a great time when we visited the national museum of korea there are lots of galleries where each has its own theme  the museum itself is informative and you will learn a lot ,Positive
1230,An acceptable attraction if you have a couple of hours to spare The museum is free and easy to get to it has its own subway station however I wouldnt put it at the top of my hit list if I was back in Seoul The displays are interesting up until a certain point but there is very little variation in what you see I saw a lot of pottery and weaponry but nothing interactive However the 12 story Pagoda in the center of the hall is worth seeing,Positive
1231,Great museum Apart from being free  the museum is a mustdo in Seoul The ground floor compromises the whole history of Korea beautifully explain from prehistory to the modern era You do not get the chance to learn much about Korea in the Western world so what this museum offers is quite unique,Positive
1232,A very nice museum with an extensive collection of artifacts from Korean culture A full day or more to see it all,Positive
1233,Quite boring as the exhibits are quite limited We spent about 1 hours and felt bored and decided to leave The plus is that it is free,Negative
1234,The English guide I had free was very good The museum has a good overview of Korean art and the guide was able to explain the historical and political significance of the pieces we saw,Positive
1235,Lots of beautiful artefacts but theyre not really presented in an engaging way If you have been to museums elsewhere in Korea youll probably see much of the same things,Positive
1236,The museum is spacious on impressive grounds There are interesting KoreanAsian artifacts from various areas recovered from a shipwreck large Buddha related sculptures etc Our audioguides did not work well but did not seem to be particularly informative when they did work,Positive
1237,I enjoyed the visit however not long enough There is so much to learn about the history of Korea here The grounds around are well maintained and a nice walk around,Positive
1238,This is a must stop for all tourists to understand Korean art in the context of Asian art Many of the national treasures are on display The temporary exhibits vary and are well worth it The cafeteria is a reasonable place to eat and the gift shop offers high quality gifts to take home,Positive
1239,The building is enormous and ugly and the collection on display is rather disappointing and small for such a huge space perhaps 5 to 6 times larger than the British Museum but less that 10 of stuff displayed there Too much space for so little stuff unless of course you are info Korean history there is a large section of the rest of Asia that does not follow any historical or geographical logic It has a lovely collection of Korean ceramics In fact this is the only think I enjoyed For other stuff of Korean royal history best to head to the Nationl Palace Museum which is elegant intimate and superb,Positive
1240,Very large campus I was there when they had a wing set aside for a special display on the Korean War If you are a military buff you HAVE to visit this museum Armored vehicles choppers and planes on display outside Even the entrance to the property with huge statues dedicated to the war will keep you for 10 minutes snapping photos I intend to go back again,Negative
1241,There are hour long tours of the highlights in English at 10 11 and 1400 which give you a good orientation I bought the museum book which helped me to choose the top sights Dont forget to look at the the building itself and to walk around the grounds there is a pagoda garden a small stream and waterfall and lovely trees,Positive
1242,A National Museum is a national showcase and gives a country the chance to really show itself off The South Koreans have really embraced the opportunity here with a massive imposing structure surrounded by a lake and manicured gardens with an air conditioned automatic walkway from the nearest subway station  The interior is no less impressive as is the collection of artefacts You could spend a whole day in here without question We took a guided tour which was provided free and hosted by a volunteer John our guide was an accomplished Englishspeaker who gave our small group of strangers a wonderfully educational and entertaining tour of what he considered to be the highlights of the museums huge collection It was a great way to get a feel for the place as well as getting some valuable cultural insights from a Seoul local  After the tour we wandered around a little ourselves then had coffee in the bright airy restaurant on the ground floor  The National Museum of Korea is worth a look; if youre pressed for time do some research and arrive in time for a guided tour Its well worth the effort,Positive
1243,Very complete museumfrom prehistoric era to Joseon dynasty with very huge and grand five story building They exhibit as well artifact from all of the world If you like art and history it is recommended to visit this museum Free of charge And dont forget to visit the artshop well more expensive but they have something that not sold in other places,Positive
1244,A very imposing building great architecture well laid out and the most extensive museum about the Asian continent esp Korea history Labels for art and display are in Korean and English Very easy to navigate and they way it was section was amazing Very good restaurant in the museum and lots of parking On our visit we were also entertained by the National Ballet of KoreaI highly recommend and certainly I will be back to visit S Korea again in the next 5 years,Positive
1245,The place is HUGE I arrived later than I planned and made it through maybe half in 2 hours Its free to go to the main exhibition hall so I didnt lose anything If I get a chance I may go back Another reviewer called it boring maybe it is This is probably not for everyone theres loads of artifacts from long ago and there is a lot of Korean history that can be witnessed but if thats not something youre into skip this place,Positive
1246,During the past decade the S Korean government has really knocked itself out to upgrade its national museums and to offer most of the exhibits to the public for free One of the best examples is the National Museum  The museum is spacious appropriately lit depending on the exhibit often using multimedia with detailed explanations in English as well as Korean Furthermore some of the museum guides are multilingual and graduated from the elite of Koreas universities As such they are often more than competent to answer visitors questions  The museum also often hosts foreign exhibitions Those exhibitions only require admittance fees So one can easily spend a half day for free exploring an exceptional museum,Positive
1247,its was a great experience to visit this museum well articolated and pleasent to visit The rooms are very well organizated and the description is very well presented Shops are very nice to buy items and things for kids I will visit the museum again,Positive
1248,The museum might be interesting for koreans or people with knowledge about korean history If you have never heard of the different korean dynasties you will only find pottery and ancient documents with chinese characters without really understanding their meaning and context There is only minimal english explanation,Positive
1249,South Korea has very strong culture Its the best place learn about it with south korea History Huge Museum and very well Maintained,Positive
1250,There is so much to see and do here the Buddah statues on the third floor the three story pagoda inside the ancient artifacts local and abroad art gallery kids zone cafe large underground parking area friendly staff mostly clean and cool on a hot day performances etc really good place to just go unplanned you wont regret it No entry fee for general admission to museum exhibit 10000 for special exhibits,Positive
1251,This museum is huge This three story museum has so much to offer from prehistoric era through more current Asian art There are paintings pottery furniture calligraphy on scrolls things from architecture figurines and more  In the middle of the first floor is a large pagoda that you cant go in but its tall and impressive  As you go around it was nice that all the items had descriptions in English so you could really learn about what you were looking at Also there was information about what things were going on at the time period that the art is from such as during the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties There were some gold crowns which surprised me some and some cool paintings We particularly liked a cat painting some of the ceramic decorated plates and a samurai uniform  While its a museum of Korea they also had artwork from India Southeast Asia China and Japan  There were stairs escalators which my son thought was fun and elevators to get between floors There were restrooms on each floor as well There was a food court and a museum shop to buy souvenirs There was so much to see here you could easily spend many hours We actually got tired towards the end and skipped a few galleries,Positive
1252,The visit gave us some idea of how the people have struggled thru the recent past but it is a colorful experience to see how hard the people worked to survive,Negative
1253,incredible collection of pottery porcelainwith galleries by eraplus beautiful building and grounds with a bell tower and gardens,Positive
1254,Almost too big with too much stuff too repetitive I recommend going a few times perhaps a floor at a time It is not of the same level as the British Museum or the Smithsonian but certainly worth your time,Positive
1255,The museum is large and there is a lot to see; you can learn about of Korean history The main exhibit hall is free Their gift shop has some nice madeinKorea items,Positive
1256,I had just a couple of hours to spare so I focused on the newer  last 1000 years sections on the Goryeo and Joseon dynasties There are many interesting exhibits but I felt that the information was limited I had a Korean friend with me who provided excellent additional context on what I was reading so that helped a lot,Positive
1257,This is an excellent museum near ichon station The station connect underground to the museum There are some really wonderful displays of Korean Prehistoric and historic artifacts as well as neighboring countries Also dont miss the Buddhist sculptures theyre quite amazing The facilitates are very clean and modern You can easily spend most of a day here Also a small convenience shop out side the main building for snacks As with many sightseeing spots in Korea it is closed on Monday Its free to enter but there may be a small fee for special exhibits As soon as you walk in there will be a reception are for tourists maps and pamphlets in English Also they have storage lockers you can use for a small fee,Positive
1258,Walk from tour bus to museum way too long for and old person By the time I reached the museum which is fantastic I was really too tired to enjoy it fully,Positive
1259,Impressive building in lovely setting Collection of Korean art is unsurpassed Everything is described in English as well as Korean,Positive
1260,Good place to visit to whom is the first timer This place will tell you how korean people life This place is near to joseon dynasty palace,Positive
1261,This museum was a complete package of artifacts spanning over 34 millenia of Korean history Complete with prehistoric ones of course The flagship museum of South Korea offers a detailed look at the history of Korea and the Korean peninsula top it all off with artifacts from various regions of Asia A mustsee,Positive
1262,big museums and family park with toddlers  theres a convenience store 2 or 3 restaurants English narration by headsets in the museums  u can access there by walk directly from Ichon station if u have a stroller no problem theres an elevator,Negative
1263,We really enjoyed the museum The pottery was very interesting and we lost track of the time there We saw exhibits on each floor but had to selective because of time The building and grounds are beautiful as well The metro stop is about 50m from the grounds,Positive
1264,I love it It was really impressed me Where we can learn a lot on Korea historical and how korean mindset from historical knowledge,Positive
1265,Huge and beautiful This has to be the most impressive museum I have ever seen A must see You will know why I boast when you get there,Positive
1266,Definitely worth a visit when you are in Seoul Huge museum learned a lot and best of all it is free to enter,Positive
1267,It is quite big with a lot of things to see and it is for FREE I think it is worth a visit They offer some guided tour so better check the schedule in advance It seems the guide are volunteers I joined one tour and I had the impression that my guide had no deep knowledge but I might be mistaken,Positive
1268,This is like any big city museum  has lots of stuff but if you sign up for a guided tour we signed up for the English speaking tour you will have a much better experience The museum store also had some nice souvenirs if you are unable to make it to Insadong,Positive
1269,As other reviewers have mentioned the museum is large in scope and covers a wide swath of Korean history I spent half a day here but definitely did not have the time to look at everything in depth One could easily spend the entire day browsing artifacts from ancient to modern Korean history As someone who admittedly was not as familiar with the history of Korea I definitely got a better sense of the different dynasties and historical figures I had just come from visiting Buddhist sites in India so the large array of Buddhist statues was interesting to see how the styles differ between different regions The grounds outside are also good for walking and have a few statues and birds flying about Did I mention that its also free,Positive
1270,A lot of artifacts and history of Korea to look at I loved the Buddhist statues and paintings the most There was just so much information to absorb I recommend if you really want to absorb it all take two days to visit to be able to really look and read all the information that is given to you,Positive
1271,The museum is oversize a huge repository of Korean culture and history dating back to prehistoric times Its almost impossible to take so much The audio tour is very poorly done and not helpful however the displays are very well done,Positive
1272,This place is HUGE really really huge and very well designed too there were a lot of school trips around and was kinda crowded but yet not stuffy we enjoyed ourselves but had to skip a lot due to lack of time If you are interested in koreas history you definitely need to go there and spend at least a full day there,Positive
1273,We spent good time in this museum were very impressed with art collectionand surroundingsand got knowledge about Korean artand rich culture,Positive
1274,Very good museum full of all treasure from around Korea and Asia I really like the space and how they create the route to understand Korean History There are lots of interesting and inspiring objects to see,Positive
1275,Great museum and well worth the time You could spend a couple days in there if you have the patients English translations are pretty good Best and most comprehensive Korean museum Ive seen yet Everything else is just redundant and incomplete,Positive
1276,great w a curator the museum provided learned Korean history more than we read on the book amazingly more collections than we saw 30 years before,Positive
1277,This is an oasis in Seoul where you can calm down and learn the relatively short history of the country After the visit you will probably naturally understand the reason with Koreas homogeneity History is truly a mirror of today,Positive
1278,This museum was one of my favorite parts of my honeymoon in Seoul First we had the best museum tour from an Englishspeaking gentleman He was engaging friendly and his knowledge and love of Korean history and art were inspiring Second the museum and its grounds are stunning We mistimed our arrival to the museum and got there far too early This turned out to be fortunate since the walk around the gardens was so beautiful Admission is free except for the traveling special exhibits I highly recommend including this as part of your trip,Positive
1279,This museum is an architectural beauty and contains comprehensive exhibits of Korean history art and crafts Entrance is free and it is easily accessible by metro,Positive

1281,Temporary Exhibition permanent exhibition nice nice both of them But sometimes temporary exhibition ticket price was a bit expensive,Positive
1282,theres a paid and a free exhibition area the free area shares koreas history  that was quite interesting if youre into cultural and anthropological history museum itself was big and very well spaced out abit hard to get a cab from there though,Positive
1283,As with most things in Seoul this museum is new large and beautifully designed The exhibits are well laidout taking you through Korean history by the cultural artifacts,Positive
1284,Take the time to stroll the gardens before spending time inside The gardens are very neat and inside the museum is huge and well laid out to explore,Positive

1286,This is a very interesting place and every visitor must go Easy to go many convenient places around and nice weather,Positive
1287,I visited with a group February 18 To start the museum buildings are beautiful They are large well lighted and open The objects are beautifully displayed in large galleries I was impressed with how each gallery flowed into another There are 3 floor with stairs and escalators between each If you like museums plan at least 2 hours There were small Gift Shops on each floor but save time for the ground floor Gift Shop which had really nice things for sale,Positive
1288,Every era of Korean history was well represented All exhibits in Korean English and Chinese English headset for 3 was useful Well laid out beautiful building and grounds Contents of a shipwreck 600 plus years ago were very good Extra traveling exhibit of Pompeii added to enjoyment,Positive
1289,You can see korian history there Traditional house palace and lots more Arts andcraft works  there traditional life and historical back ground ,Neutral
1290,National Museum of Korea and Hangul Museum of Korea are situated in adjoining locationsHangul Museum is about origins of Korean Alphabets made by their King about 500 years BC well explained showing its ease  its importance in day to day computer age NATIONAL MUSEUM is much bigger in the foreground is a large oval mirror pond which shows the museum buildings outside are well spread gardens with Buddha Statues and a couple of Pagodas a family picnic parkMuseum has an art Gallery on Ground floor presently showing POMPEII Italian ancient cityOther three floors well connected by good elevators to go up and come down show ancient history of mankind and animals Sections showing history culture of India Japan China and KoreaMany ceramics tools paintings and statues are well preserved and documentedGuides availableA GOOD FEEL OF HISTORYA good Souvenir shop too,Positive
1291,Dont miss  Its a very huge museum in Seoul Many rooms and exhibition Should arrive in the morning and spend at least 3 hours here Food court is located outside the museum in the front as well as the convenience store,Positive
1292,Ive been to this museum a few times It is very well laid out and has a lot of different things It tends to emphasixe the artistic aspects of Korean history There are various Englishlanguage helps electronic and labels  Outside you can relax and contemplate which for me is great considering how hectic Seoul is  It might be a little confusing going in knowing whither to go and what to do with packages and cloaks but just ask,Positive
1293,Definitely lucked out and scored a tour with a super friendly and helpful guide who kept us all laughing and not getting to bogged down in details The golden crown is beautiful  there is loads to keep you interested for long after the tour finishes  Also check out the architecture huge building and very interesting to look at from different angles,Positive
1294,As all museum also the National Museum of Korea is very interesting Perhaps the section for the Paleolithic and Neolithic is a bit confused Very nice the private collections section,Positive
1295,It was well organized clean and had amazing things to look at The history was phenomenal I would highly recommend this as stop,Positive
1296,Worth seeing to understand Korean history and art there is also free englishspeaking guide who will definitely lift up your mood,Positive
1297,pay some of your time to this museum to introduce yourself to Korean history and culture Get their before noon to avoid crowds,Negative
1298,The building itself is very impressive and there is just SOOO much to see that you need to visit more than once to take it all in Free Englishspeaking tours by very good docents are also available and worth your while,Positive
1299,The museum consists of three floors and covers Korean history rather extensively Theres also a childrens section and special exhibitions The museum is easy to get to and in a beautiful location If youre in Seoul during the Pompeii exhibition its definitely worth the excursion,Positive
1300,Recently built this huge building is filled with tons of artifacts showing the rich history of Korea Its worth several hours BUT if you only have time for one such museumand dont mind payingthe Leeum Samsung is better,Positive
1301,This is a vast museum You can absolutely go for a few hours then come back another day for more fun Note to parents  theres a smallish but free kids museum inside Its worth a visit and you might be able to bribe your kids to behave in the ancient exhibits by promising they can visit it There are also traveling exhibits that come and go for a fee  the Pompeii one thats there until sometime in March is excellent and worth the won My only complaint about this place is that the signs in English tell the date the artifact was acquired by the museum  not the approximate date it was created,Positive
1302,Having just visited the War Memorial which was excellent the National Museum in contrast was a bit of a letdown There are some good exhibits here no doubt but most are largely minor dull items and not very informational I dont recall seeing much national treasures here as well  You have to be real students of ancient Korean history to really appreciate the details of the various dynasties We also thought it would have been more useful to have a more general overview of the dynasties from the start instead of just going in chronological order We didnt spend as much time here as we thought we would and would recommend you skip this if pressed for time,Positive
1303,Free as people have mentioned except special exhibits The space outside is nice too There are free lockers so you dont have to lug too much stuff around especially in the winter you put in a small amount and get it back when you return the key  Also for Running Man fans they have been in this museum at least twice so it will look familiar to you,Positive
1304,Wheather you are a korean or not you should visit here In huge territory buildings pond and small garden are here Except for some extra exhibition you can come into the museum free I think government has to make a entrance fee but anyway now its free From paleolithic age to modern of Korea you can see everything about tangible cultural heritage Parking lots are ready but i recommend a transport by subway 2 restaurants and 1 convenience store are in the museum but expensive If you can make a picnicbasket and visit here,Positive
1305,If you are a museum goers you should not miss this museum I came in Nov 2012 where there was some construction going on and it took me a while to find this museum and now you get to see the museum once you come out of the exit No need to search around absolute convenience The museum itself is beautiful and you can see the N Seoul Tower behind the museum The standard exhibition is free admission and it holds details of history of the country The collection is huge and if you spend time looking thru all items it easily takes a day This visit I do not have the time to view all the standard exhibition just like my previous visit Hence Ill be back ,Positive
1306,Historyfilled place  great place to know more about the history of Korea Accessible and located near the Citys tourist spots too,Positive
1307,This beautiful building has something for everyone The collections are well curated and can be visited quickly 2 hours for my husband and me or at length 6 hours for our daughter who lives in Korea Both types of visits resulted in total satisfaction and enhanced knowledge of Korean culture and art The restaurant was excellent and there are several options for dining on site The gift shop is outstanding,Positive
1308,Excellent half day tour  Take your time to read Korean history The facility is clean and full of learning kids that is A  to look around not just the past and also present time,Positive
1309,This is my fourth time to this museum in several trips Always something new to discover about Korean culture The first floor has nice graphics to explain the time periods three kingdoms etc The celadon ceramics rooms are always an important stop My wife and I enjoyed a visit to the third floor tea room  try the Sipjeondaebotang tea for an unusual and very tasty picker upper ten herbs including ginseng and angelica root Around the corner from the tea room are the very interesting displays of discoveries from a significant shipwreck Chinese and Japanese  There is a special exhibit on Pompeii a modest charge the main museum is free which was absolutely superb and includes more artifacts and information than you can currently obtain onsite at Pompeii  very well worth the visit  Easy to access by subway  take the Ichon stop on the light blue 4 line and it is right there,Positive
1310,A well laid out museum with very interesting exhibits clearly labeled with all the information you need to understand the exhibits Lots of water fountains and bathrooms that are easy to find,Positive
1311,Good place to learn about Korean history and relax away from the busy shopping districts Amazing that it is free especially because one can spend a whole day at the museum The cafe on the 3rd floor is great serving tasty traditional korean tea,Positive
1312,the building in itself is a magnificent work of architecture  utilising all electronic advancements that South Korea has to offer; the curatorial design is admirable the content less impressive; but then again  if museums are viewed more their presentation than content this structure delivers,Positive
1313,You may take seoul city tour bus drop you right infront of the National Museum the building is unique with lots of information in there,Negative
1314,Our family of three spend a whole day here The exhibits were interesting and the guided tour was very informative We got a glimpse into the history of Korean and its people and got to know them a little better,Positive
1315,This museum is arranged very well and each of the exhibits is extremely informational The main exhibits are also free as well as some of the childrens exhibits You also wont get any sideways looks for bringing young ones in the main area There were more than a couple less than well behaved children running around without issue Special exhibits will cost you Honestly though you could spend the entire afternoon there and still not make it through all of the resident exhibits It is also collocated with Yongsan Family Park so in the warmer months you are right next to another family attraction,Positive
1316,This museum is just the right size Not too small or too large Nice little ending to your visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace Has items adults  kids would like to look at Also check out the Chinese zodiac figures outside the entrance to the museum,Positive
1317,A nice place to look a koreans history and I must say they had done this quite well Very nicely presented Though I am not a museum lover I appreciated my visit here,Positive
1318,Excellent place to start to understand Korean history and culture The architecture is stunning so is the view Admission is free and as the place is huge with 34 floors of exhibit do allocate sufficient time min 1 hour to go through the exhibits without rush,Positive
1319,Love the layout of this massive structure and its surroundings   The permanent installation gives you a good lesson in Korean history culture and art  Cheap free if I remember correctly  Not to many people weekday  Not far from the subway   They have another building for temporary exhibitions to enter was much more expensive ,Positive
1320, Large comfortable museum Learned quite a bit about Korean history from the exhibits  Colection of Japanese Chinese and Indian artificacts was impressive as was history of each cultures impact on Korea  Worth the time to visit,Positive
1321,It is big building with lots of things from different Asian countries You can go there more and more If you like culture you will enjoy this place,Positive
1322,here showed all the historical stuffs beautifully so glad here like a place could escape from reality and take a rest and deep breathe,Positive
1323,This museum has terrific exhibits of historic items beautifully displayed We visited this as part of a field trip for the IMCoS symposium,Positive
1324,If you know nothing about Koreas history the national museum is a great place to learn a bit about it I spent around 6 hours there and enjoyed very much this museum It is very well organized There is a restaurant there with good food and not so expensive The outside area is also beautiful especially during autumn time,Positive
1325,Maybe in asia can be one of best modern architecture Mussuem  well made it and clean  great lighting  free entrance  Only negative thing  there isnt so many valuable items there ,Positive
1326,This is a splendid architectural building and the museums display shows a high degree of expertise I spent four hours there with not a single tedious moment,Positive
1327,I went early morning of 19th October 2014 to National Korean museum because I wanted to spend a half day there First of all I found building architectures beautiful I liked building outside decoration of garten plantpots pool and pavillon Museum entry is free Object and exhibited items should be varied and very interesting But there had been a serious issue with museum male employees who were disturbing me in every hall I entered because they were seeking attention At each time they walked fast towards my direction while making noises like coughing and that made me nervous So I couldnt concentrate checking exhibition items I entered museum at around 0900 am and almost no visitors were there I just sow a school class and another visitors group I unfortunately decided to break off visit and went to check interesting big souvenir shop,Positive
1328,When I went here I Im so overwhelmed about the Korean culture They really value and they are taking a good care of their culture and tradition,Positive
1329,Very direct and well informed describes this museum If you want to learn about Korean history this is the place to be Great info and many exhibits brings you back in time A great place to spend several hours learning about Korea,Positive
1330,loved the museum and have had a good understanding of the traditions and humble nature of the past and the present,Positive
1331,Its the best Museum in Korea You can meet treasure of Art and culture  located in Ichon Subway station on blue line hug park with so you can injoy go for a walk,Positive
1332,Thorough information on the history of Korea which I enjoyed Dont forget to enjoy the scenic view outside the Museum and snap lots of pictures,Positive
1333,We had not visited this place before but so glad we did this time Beautiful building and a stunning Korean pottery gallery that showed the most amazing collection,Positive
1334,National museum of Korea was transferred to the current location in 2005 It really includes a huge of cultural assets It takes one day long to view them in detail Many locals students and kids visit this place Nearby there are Yongsan family park War Museum of Korea,Negative
1335,We went early on Oct3rd which was a holiday Very few people when we arrived so had the chance to see alot in a relatively short period of time Exhibits were awesome and the building was bright airy and clean My wife was interviewed by two high school students doing a project on visitors reaction to both the Museum and Seoul in general Gift shop was well stocked and prices were reasonable The museum in spacious,Positive
1336,Admission is free Yes there is a lot of old pottery The crown of the Kings of Silla was on display as well They have one of the most beautiful collections of celadon in two rooms The open design of the place is worth mentioning too No overstuffed rooms here,Positive
1337,Take your time its beautifully displayed just magnificent We didnt have enough time to really see it all but what we did see was enchanting,Positive
1338,the collection and the building are impresive but 1 place is crowded I do not recommend going during weekends 2 To many kids taking photos of almost everything 3 skip the prehistoric part Also you will probably have to have one day for that museum is huge and there is also a big park where you can spend some time,Positive
1339,An extraordinary rich culture brought to life through art and history Enjoyed learning and especially the pottery,Positive
1340,Quiet clean plenty to see We were with a group so we didnt get to explore on our own If I had the time to go back I would,Positive
1341,Loved this museum Give yourself 34 hours If you are English speaking be sure to take the one hours english speaking tour in order to get acquainted with the museum,Positive
1342,There were not as many artifacts as I had hope for Most of the items on displayed were rather recent; from 19th century onwards,Positive
1343,A good starting to know Korean Culture The admission if free why not have a visit if you have time to do so The atmosphere of the museum is great I spent the evening there by just sitting on the park after the visit,Positive
1344,I thought it was strange that this place is free for a museum Though it gives you a better understanding of the Korean Culture A definite must visit place when you are in Seoul,Positive
1345,Its huge Its almost as big as an airport terminal The exhibits were well curated although it would be nice to have a diorama exhibit to show how the early Koreans lived Would love also to have a replica Hanok village as a light and sound exhibit,Positive
1346,Learned a lot of stuff from our tour guide when we went here There were 4 areas in the museum and we only went to one as the place is very big and may take most of our time in our tour There are small descriptions on each of the displayed artifacts but hearing things from our guide made more sense The place is pretty huge but their are signs and stuff so you wont get lost You can learn a lot here about Korean history so it is a must go,Positive
1347,Dont get me wrong this museum is decent The only thing is that it pales in comparison to the brilliant art museum and war memorial  both of which have good collections of historical items themselves  So I would give this one a miss just because other museums  locations are better  Even if you had time to see ONE museum I would go to the war memorial,Positive
1348,nice city map big museum and nice garden you can spend there easily 3 hours outdoor and indoor nice and friendly staffs,Positive
1349,I am not a museum goer but bowed to the pressure of my friend I enjoyed the museum both inside and outside  architecturally its great It has lots of little nooks with vistas of the beautiful landscaping where one can process what one has seen The early Korean artifacts are particularly worth the visit,Positive
1350,I really enjoyed visiting the National Museum of Korea It is a very popular attraction for Koreans as well  it was packed when I went there over a rainy weekend Beautiful collections although no detailed information in English Still super worth a visit,Positive
1351,We went for the Korean history of ceramics Their collection goes back two thousand years and shows the development in ceramics very beautifully,Positive
1352,Good location Very accessible Place is well maintained Toilets needs more maintenance Staffs are ready to help out Enough sitting areas to accommodate visitors who are overwhelmed by the place,Positive
1353,If you love most museums then youd probably find this one pretty good However I think its a bit boring there are no spectacular or particularly fascinating exhibits I love science museums and natural history museums to give you an idea of my interests  but this one was too dull A lot of the exhibits were the same and I think you can enjoy Korean culture more by visiting temples and palaces However the paleolithic section was interesting  purely because of the age of the artefacts and not the Korean history,Positive
1354,I guess it depends on your interests but I found the set up very good but you can only see that much of pots until it gets boring Still well worth a visit but stay away from the food  coffee,Positive
1355,Given the brutal treatment of this lovely country through history it is go good to see how much they have from their rich cultural pastHuge building crazy cheap to enter you can wander here for a couple of hours and still not see it all A sophisticated very impressive devotion to all things intellectual and artistic Korean history comes to life here through the objects and you realise how advanced a culture it has been when you look at the dates of things like the art and written materials,Positive
1356,We took the subway Got off at Ichon on the Jungang line aqua It is a covered walk almost all the way to the museum entrance Main museum entrance is free It is a stunning building from the inside and all the displays are well signed posted in English We tried to get the MP3 audio guide but there werent any available at the time Apparently they can be booked on line at the museums website may be worth doing We spent a great 3 hours there on a drizzly day Well worth it if you get sick of just seeing palaces and shops galore,Positive
1357,If you are interested in history you should go and spend a view hours inside Read the signs otherwise plates swords and coins are not special If you dont like history see the museum from the outside amazing and huge building and visit the Family Park next to it Check out the homepage for free English tours through the museum We also really enjoyed the Teahouse inside You can taste many different traditional teas,Positive
1358,This museum is definitely worth visiting The architecture is amazing and very spacious The displays are of high quality and as usual in modern Korean museums well supported by audio visual gadgets The access is very impressive and you can get there from Ichon Metro Station through an underground walkway protecting you from becoming wet in wet summers,Positive
1359,A great museum to explore for a day With collections from many countries and especially the Ship wreck excavation The information about the porcelain and ceramic craftsmanship the yin and Yan method is quite interesting The architecture is grand the landscape is soothing Wonderful visit,Positive
1360,Its worth the trip to the museum It was free to enter and covers the evolution of the country culture  prehistory Be prepared to spend a minimum of 4 hours  There are also nice walking trails and areas for a picnic on the grounds around the museum They had a childrens museum next door and special exhibits which you need to pay for but we didnt have time to visit,Positive
1361,This is a museum with an extensive collection of not just Korean art and artifacts but from other Asian countries as well It was the last sight we saw before returning home and well worth it,Positive
1362,Beautiful part of town and a lovely walk through the complex  Displays however are quite poor  You can only get so excited about 2 and a half floors of potsadd a Buddha or two and you have finished,Positive
1363,The museum and the collection is huge We went on the weekend so there were some live performances which was nice There is a huge park next to the museum It is child and disabled friendly with ramps and elevators everywhere We were a bit disappointed as we could not go to the childrens museum as it requires prior booking Lots of options to eat and lovely museum shop Was not easy to find a cab back from there as it is on a highway kind of road All in all good fun for free,Positive
1364,It is a place where you have to be while visiting Korea Museum has a great structuredesign It is free to entry and give us a great lesson of Korean history and broad overlook at its culture,Positive
1365,Its an interesting lesson of Korean history There are also cafes and restaurants and many rest areas,Positive
1366,This museum is free There are special exhibits that require a fee I would recommend getting a tour guide to get a broader understanding of the art We used the headsets which did not help with navigating the museum efficiently or add a great deal more than the descriptions on the art I ran into a guide giving an English speaking group a tour She was entertaining interesting and brought a wonderful perspective to each piece,Positive
1367,The items inside are worth to see There is a funny machine to take photos but we cant receive the emails with the photos  Disappointed,Negative
1368,There you can follow the Korean history from start to almost nowadays Also they have a really nice collection on eastern art  I was really impressed by a Buda statue from PakistanAfganistan border it had an Helenic style probably because Alexander the Great being in that zone,Positive
1369,This museum is spacious and well laid out with great exhibits showcasing the history of Korea It isnt the Smithsonian so dont expect that but it is very nice It takes the visitor from the prehistoric ages to present through the many changes that the Korea culture has undergone I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in learning more about the unique and interesting history of this place While we were visiting there was a touring exhibit from the Musee dOrsey of France with beautiful pieces from the impressionists There is a small cost to the extra exhibits but the museum itself is free of charge If you choose to eat there the only food we found on offer was local food  be forewarned,Positive
1370,The building itself is a piece of art surrounded by trees and a pond Theres a free entry for the permanent exhibitions,Positive
1371,I was amazed by the quality of the free exhibition and gained so much new information about the Korean history and culture Theres overwhelmingly large collection of historical items and one day is hardly enough to see all the 3 floors The second art related floor was though not my favourite and skipped that almost completely  The acient history up to around 1500s was covered very well but theres some gaps we could say from 17001900m so perhaps thats something to imporove during the next years,Positive
1372,Firstly the architecture of this building will blow you away It is just a beautifully designed space that is a pleasure to spend time in The exhibits are fantastic Id suggest the guided tour which shows some of the main highlights and given some orientation then do some exploring on your own This museum has a great range of exhibits that will engage people of all ages There are also a few nice little places to eat and a great gift shop,Positive
1373,You would find scores of stuff and have a look at ancient Korea and why is it called hermit kingdom Ii worth one visit for Indians to feel proud of their rich heritage,Positive
1374,Given that this is the National Museum of Korea it seemed a little short on substance Entry into the permanent exhibitions was free  the current additional French Musee dOrsay display required a fee The galleries were well laid out and there was a good accompanying map of the museum in English Given our European background the Korean Calligraphy and painting gallery was too much for us but we did admire some of the marvellous ceramics in the Sculpture and Craft Hall Seemed lacking in atmosphere,Positive
1375,We were pleasantly surprised to see that a traveling collection of Impressionist Art from Paris Musee dOrsay was at the National Museum of Korea the day we showed up After enjoying that we toured the regular collection which features Buddhist art Korean ceramics landscape paintings medieval pieces and so much more that one day wasnt enough Best of all the regular collections are free admission so you can return another day to finish looking All the facilities are of an excellent standard,Positive
1376,Easy to go there with the subway line 4  Ichon station Majestic entrance and pond The museum is free Koreas history is exposed in grand rooms Visiting the museum helps understading the ancien way of life in Korea,Positive
1377,For those who have been to museums such as the palace museums of both Beijing and Taipei this museum may be slightly underwhelming However it is still the best place to start brushing up and understanding the history of Korea and understanding its place in both ancient and modern Asia  Entrance is free and its easy to spend at least half a day there,Positive
1378,There is so much information to ingest here that you really need to spread it out over a few days If all you want to do is walk through and look at stuff you could tackle that in a few hours but you really want to appreciate the history that is here The museum is huge and you need to allot several hours to get through maybe even three sections I had to come here several times and after 1yr in Korea did not manage to complete every section There are brochures in English and several other languages There are two sides to the museum and the right side is free The other side houses a concert hall and special exhibitions,Positive
1379,Korea has a long and intersting history an culture This musuem is a great way to get some basic understanding The bulding itself has an amazing arcitecture Especialy the interior Fantastic to have this free of charge,Positive
1380,We loved this Museum and we only covered a small part of it It is a spacious magnificent building and one that Korea and Seoul can be justly proud It is set out as a traditional museum with exhibits displayed in cases There is good signage and information in English You really need to allow several hours to do this place justice which we didnt to our regret,Positive
1381,Well only go if you are interested in the history But its rather educational and interesting to learn about Korea history ,Positive
1382,I wouldnt have gone here if I wasnt in Seoul for 10 days  if you are here for less I would recommend going to a Temple or another site instead unless you are REALLY into Korean history there are 3 floors which are free to see and numerous sections with art and collections  I really would recommend this if you are a huge museum and Korean fanatic  There are other exhibits which you must pay for but the general admission was free  The museum was so crowded  The museum itself and its location was nice,Positive
1383,The museum was architecturally lovely and had beautiful archeological findings Probably better if you know some Korean history We only made it as far as the second floor and liked the furniture section best Our group enjoyed even more the performance area outside where children were dancing on a Saturday afternoon I went to the Musee dOrsay touring collection of impressionist paintings across the patio and was wowd Dont know how long it will be in town but this was many gorgeous pieces with some littleseen and unfamiliar paintings by wellknown painters such as Gaugin Monet several Lautrec Pizarro Rousseau plus a few large realist portraits and a section on the building of the Eiffel Tower Well worth the 12 admission,Positive
1384,This was a great place to go to soak up the culture of the Koreans dating back to 1300BC It is an amazing building with three levels of culture and information It was also free which was not expected but great for the traveller on a budget like me  My only issue was that it was a museum and I personally do not find them that interesting I only went because a local suggested it  but do not get me wrong i do not regret it and would go again if given the chance If you are really into museums this is for you  you could really spend an entire day If museums are not your thing i still recommend you going to check it out as you can learn so much about the history of Korea,Positive
1385,This is an impressive building and collectionhowever you are only going to enjoy this visit if you have a deep appreciation of korean early historyartand sculptureif like me this is not an interest then dont botherit is some distance from the centre and you must take a taxi,Positive
1386,The museum is quite big with three floors and a garden They are having the Impressionism exhibition now You can rent audio guide with either Korean or English Nice trip,Positive
1387,A well laid out museum Entrance was freeFascinating insight into Korean history and culture We loved the pottery on display,Positive
1388,This museum is huge Anything you want to see Its also free We were there at the time of the great Impressionism exhibit which was wonderful it had a cost Overall a must see,Positive
1389,I first visited this place with my school As schools would they gave us like 15 hours a worksheet to complete and set us upon the museum like some unfortunate Running Man game without prize nametagsripping nor a scary Kim Jongkook  That was not how I wanted to remember this place  I went again with my mum We took 1 day for each level As a matter of fact at this very moment we have yet to complete Level 1 We walked 2 whole days for Levels 2 and 3  This museum has an expansive collection of artifacts both from Korea and from other Asian regions At the entrance of each section there are boards to explain the significance of each collection All artifacts are labelled in Korean English Chinese and Japanese There are also guided tours  However Please do check for grammatical and spelling errors of the displays They go not they goes; frog not flog Also  should be maple not cherry The mentioned mistakes were found in the paintings section but I cannot remember which level  My mums vegetarian and I would like to commend one of the museum staff for recommending us a vegetarian restaurant when he heard about her dietary preference Also the restaurant on Level 1 NaMu was willing to prepare Jeonju Bibimbap without egg However they served up banchan with egg rolls and kimchi which contained shrimp paste as ingredients So do make sure you explain your dietary requirements in detail  This museum is free allows nonflash photography and has a lot of benches for people to rest at when they are tired I recommend people to visit this if they have a strong interest in history as well as art  At the moment I have not visited the Childrens Museum but kids might like that better than this,Positive
1390,Its a free museum in addition to being an awesome visit Not too many interactive exhibits but there is a nice outdoor family park Can be a great relaxing day to walk the park and then into the building during the hot part of the day Restaurant at the lake is pricey but the convenience store has all the necessities Easy walk from the subway Great views of Seoul Tower,Positive
1391,Free tours in English and an outstanding collection of art There is a huge stone Pagoda on the first floor that extends up through the atrium Fine examples of Korean art and culture through the ages,Positive
1392,A very good overview of Korean history and culture Also an interesting section on other Asian civilizations Very good museum shop to get fine quality presents at all price ranges,Positive
1393,What a fantastic facility Give yourself plenty of time and breaks The first floor ancient history section can take several hours; very well done,Positive
1394,beautiful building and free entry charge to the permanent exhibition  the special exhibit this time around was the Charles Monets collection of impressionism and it was amazing cause it was so close and some of them had no glass so you can see the brush strokes and smell the pain,Positive
1395,Yes i sound like a spam title But seriously they should start charging people Great collection of national treasures and historic artifacts and paintings Spacious and quiet if you are lucky enough to avoid field tripping schoolkids Wonderful garden Location is kind of tricky Use subway if possible,Positive
1396,If youre looking to learn more about the history and culture of the Korean Peninsula you will not be disappointed The collection is carefully presented in a detailed chronological timeline of the history of the peninsula in the past couple millennia The free touchscreen audio guides were awesome to get even more insights on the artifacts history The architecture of the museum and their beautiful surrounding gardens and park I think are also an attraction on their own The food court has several options Asian and Western and is actually pretty high quality It is no wonder is a popular attraction and all the praise they get is well deserved,Positive
1397,Its an wonderful experience  we have to give full marks to the Korean government All 3 floors are very well maintained It should be a model for the whole world Free entry is another plus point,Positive
1398,If you like ancient stuff and history This is a place to come They keep thing very well Place is big clean and quiet Lots of thing to see,Positive
1399,Learn a lot of history and get to see a lot of collection Really nice place to visit Do consider coming here,Positive
1400,This was one of the hop on hop off stop I spent more than an hour here It seems to be far away from the town centre  I am not well versed in Korean history so I did not know what to expect The building itself is very impressive Huge buildings with large grounds But the exhibits seems to be lackingthere are some prehistoric exhibits of pottery etc artifacts from the Joseon era some private collections I could have missed some exhibits cos I did not want to miss my bus Somehow I thought there should be more from each era maybe the types of attire worn Anyway good for a quick visit  There was a lot of local students there on the day of my visit,Positive
1401,This museum is very familyfriendly There is a cafeteria with lots of choices both traditional and fast food The gift shop has many fun cultural items that your kids can take home and treasure for a long time Best of all there is a childrens museum attached that is completely handson We have been here several times as it is free and a fun way to spend an afternoon  Check out the extensive grounds outside as there is a playground pond waterfall and Yongsan Family Park is accessible by walking the path If you want other places to visit in the area grab a taxi to go around the bend to IPark MallYongsan Station where you will also find the electronics market Or take a taxi the opposite direction to go to Itaewon Its even feasible to walk there if you feel like having a stroll,Positive
1402,The National Museum of Korea is an impressive modern construction situated in a quiet quarter of hectic Seoul The construction is huge and impressive attesting to the love and respect of Koreans for its past cultural treasures The interior is spacious and allows easy access to visitors However one wished that it would contain more cultural treasures of the rich artistic heritage of the country Statues porcelains and paintigs are quite representative but they lack some outstanding references like the Monalisa in the Louvre or the Elgin Marbles of the British Museum It is to be hoped that more important cultural heritage masterpieces are brought to this magnificent space in order to fill up the avid artistic interests of the visitor,Positive
1403,This is definitely more popular with the women as many of its best exhibits are ceramics The best feature is the very modern structure which is the reason I gave it 3 instead of 2 stars This was part of a tour and I am sure they took us here because it was free,Positive
1404,This place is awesome simply recommenadable for foreigners visiting the countrybecause it has a free entry in main hall and whole lot of beaituful sceneries especially in spring like in May or June of the yearlot of good sceneries and that it has good connetivity using subwayand city tour bus one thing it lacks is that it is still expanding in its contents and attracts whole lot of peopledue to which your valuable experience might go unpleasant,Positive
1405,This is a beautiful and very large museum The pottery is magnificent Entrance is free and the food court is good and inexpensive,Positive
1406,if you appreciate art of all mediums and enjoy fine art museums this is the place to be both on a rainy day and a sunny day The grounds are stunning as well Theres a wealth of exhibits and a separate childrens museum as well Very familyfriendly or perfect for singles and couples  Allow yourself time here as its a largescale museum,Positive
1407,This museum was definitely huge and full of artifacts but it wasnt my favorite place to visit Maybe we should have taken a tour instead of just walking around on our own but I found it long If you enjoy history this is the place for you There is a lot to see so be prepared to spend quite a bit of time here The building is impressive and very modern,Positive
1408,This is a huge building The exhibitions gave us a good understanding of the history of the emperors era of korean Good place to kill half day time,Positive
1409,We had a lovely and informative visit to the National Museum of Korea The tour guide was an incredibly knowledgable volunteer who spent extra time explaining areas we were interested in and answering many questions It ended up being a very personal tour experience since only the 3 members of my family were on the tour She mentioned that winter is a slow tourist season and so many of her winter groups were very small The artifacts were incredible While the posted signs are all in English and it is easy to enjoy this museum without a guided tour the background and stories she provided really helped provide a cultural and historic context So much more meaningful that just reading the signs Her English was incredible and her passion for history was evident Be sure to check the schedule and arrive at front desk right at the time the English tour is offered It is free and starts punctually so you dont want to miss it We stopped in the museum cafe after the tour which was supposed to last 15 hours but she asked if we wanted to extend it and we spent 25 hours together There arent many restaurants in the area outside of the museum The food in the museum was ok Not great but we were happy to support their service since the museum and tour were free Also they have a cute coffee shop and lovely tea shop in the museum The tea shop seemed quiet with few visitors The coffee shop was lively and delicious for a quick snack and warm up VERY easy to get to museum from subway Just get out the stop and follow the signs A subway tunnel walks directly to museum entrance,Positive
1410,Toom the english guided tour Learned a lot about buddhism and the differnet images of buddha Buddha statues actually looms different from japan korea china and india and it looks similar to the local peoplw,Negative
1411,Its a very big museum filled with the history of Korea but also other sections It is a good way to start a trip if youre interested in Korean culture and history it helps to understand better many things and will help you to get a historical starting context at other important cultural locations in the country during your trip I thought it was really interesting and definitely worth spending a day ,Positive
1412,This museum tell you story of korea Also near with the palace an blue house So if you go here you will see all of them in one time Better come in the morning You can hire the voice gude for 1000 won or use your smarphone as voice guide,Positive
1413,Pretty standard museum The best part was a video animation of a traditional Chinese painting that changes with the seasons It was so good we watched it twice Unless you are very historical you probably wont get much out of it We didnt visit the childrens museum at the same location but I imagine it is more entertaining for families,Positive
1414,The foodcourt is excellent so come hungry the giftshop has some unique and well priced arts too  so its worth stopping by here too The museum itself is above average and has some good displays,Positive
1415,I was happy to visit this museum for the fact that it is one of the top ten museums of the world and rightfully lives up to its reputation with so much artifacts and exhibits that makes your jaw drop The only problem I had around this place was that they had a very limited amount of information in English and rest everything is written in Korean and whatever small amount of information was written in English didnt even suffice to make you get the point of the whole display I was fortunate enough to actually get a guide with me that made me enjoy the place and appreciate it much more effectively The palace also has a good restaurant that has a good quality food and a good ambiance to relax after all the walking,Positive
1416,Walking up to the Museum you could see the extensive details placed in building the museum with gardens pillar of poles with a reflecting pool and a pagoda with celadon tile roof as the focal point really awesome to see Being interested to know how Korea came about we went directly to the prehistory and Ancient history gallery I am fascinated with all the artifacts they kept that it tells the story of all the periods so dramatically We went also to the third floor to look at the collections of celadon vase and other blue and white porcelains Overall I enjoyed our visit here and if we happen to be back in Korea will surely visit again,Positive
1417,This museum is very comprehensive with good rental audio commentary I think it is a must in Seoul The museum building is also impressive,Positive
1418,So many teenagers behaving terribly  running around yelling It seemed like they were using this free place as a hang out,Positive
1419,Admission is free with lots of interesting and varied displays in a large airy modern building Worth the hours to take in the historical and cultural exhibits But beware they r closed on Monday We went on a mon n had to return the next day ,Positive
1420,I am absolutely impressed by the incredible amount of care detail and thought that went into creating this space starting from its modern architecture created particularly to showcase some of the most important relics of Korean and Asian history without overshadowing them  The surrounding gardens incorporate the outdoor exhibit into nature while featuring many trees and flowers that are native to the region and known as symbols of the country and culture  The collection is presented as a long chronological story in a very accurate and sophisticated way They offer a guided audiointeractive touchscreen tablet tour free of charge with in depth descriptions and information of all the works on display which I recommend  It is a large space so depending on the pace it may be from a half day to a full day to visit especially if visiting the gardens  They do also have a food court decent for being fast food There is also a formal restaurant we didnt have the time to try  Worth the visit for those that would like to learn more about the culture from a historical perspective,Positive
1421,This relatively new addition to the Seoul scene offers not only beautifully displayed exhibits about Korea and other parts of Asia but also stunning architecture and exquisite landscaping The 3story building is immense with exhibits located in more intimate rooms off a huge main hall which is open to the thirdfloor ceiling  Admission is free and Englishspeaking staff wait to answer questions on the first floor Items are for sale most are a bit pricey in a large gift shop on the first floor and in smaller areas throughout the building There are also a traditional tea room at least one cafe and a restaurant in the building The garden holds a large restaurant too with mostly set menus of traditional food Though expensive we found the fare here to be delicious  It is possible for museum lovers to spend hours in the museum But many may prefer to pick and choose from the excellent floor plan and simply get an overview of what is offered We visited for the first time three years ago but only had an hour to spare We found ourselves impressed enough to return to see more a few days ago  The museum is easily reached by metro,Positive
1422,Certainly value for money with lots of interesting and varied displays in a large airy modern building Certainly worth the hours itll take to truly take in the historical and cultural exhibits,Positive
1423,The museum is very modern and items well displayed It is very large and plan what you want to see as it would take many days to see it all,Positive
1424,I visited the museum for the first time a few days ago and was very impressed First of all its free I joined an English speaking touralso freewhich lasted 90 minutes The tour was just ok since the guide was sort of soft spoken However this is an impressive place The building itself is gorgeous and there are three stories of exhibits I especially enjoyed the calligraphy and painting exhibit as well as the large display of Buddha statues I took the tour had lunch visited the store and then went back to see more exhibits In total I was here 3 hours Since it was raining all day this was a nice alternative to the many outdoor sites in Seoul,Positive
1425,It is well worth the visit Great and extensive collection  amazing in its richness and very fascinating as well well worth the visit,Positive
1426,I went to this museum in late afternoon and while the landscaping and architecture of the building were great I really dont care too much about vases from 1100 AD  I was expecting more on the history on Korea and all I got were a bunch of artifacts Dont get me wrong I thought the Buddha castings and calligraphy was very cool but I spent about 30 mins just quickly browsing,Positive
1427,It was nice to be in a museum that is filled with Koreans learning about their history and artefacts  It is a nice spot to sit outside on the steps and watch the world go by  Easy transport links from the subway system,Positive
1428,A lot to see very clean very big a lot of kids running around from school groups If you like history and other countries culture pay for a guide and tour through this museum many levels and many sections on each level which separates each time in the history of Korea,Positive
1429,This museum showcases Korean artartifactssculpturespaintings from ancient times to the modern area If youre into museums you could easily spend a day here Admission is free and there are multilingual guide services available for a nominal fee If youre inclined the Yongsan Park is close by where you can take in some of Koreas natural beauty,Positive
1430,The Seoul National Museum was the first stop of the City Tour that we went into It was nice and educational but not really compulsory if youre not into history,Positive
1431,An excellent institution Very focused on Korean and SE Asian art and they have done a fabulous job in display as well as collection We spent 5 hours and have seen everything on every floor It is big bit not nearly as big or overwhelming or versatile like Louvre or Met Start on the third floor with excellent SE Asian and Central Asian collection Nowhere else in the world I have seen any better Central Asian artifacts One point I have noted that the entire SE and East Asian collection was done in last 10 years or so Curious me asked where they have purchased their stuff from The staff at the front desk did not know the answer but in a few days NY Times answered my question by publishing an article about the rich thieves in India who have been selling the national treasures to museums and private collectors world wide Nevertheless it is a great collection The Japanese section was weak but nice Try the Tea House at the end of this gallery Wonderful setting and inexpensive for a museum tea shop  Rest of the third floor and most of second was Buddhist art and Korean ceramics and porcelain Yet another fabulous Celadon collection First floor was pre historic artifacts and Korean history This is the most crowded floor and for me was the least attractive one but it is my personal taste Everything and I mean EVERYTHING has English explanation Yes there are more Korean explanation but the main points were explained in English for every single object  Avoid the restaurant on the first floor It is inexpensive but only one place in Seoul where we had really BAD food  We are planning to go to Korea next year and yes we will come back to this museum again,Positive
1432,The National Museum of Korea got a lot of beautiful sculptures calligraphy and old artifacts but for me the most impressive was the building it is very modern with at huge hall made of glass so beautiful,Positive
1433,This is a real treasure to visit From the architecture of the building itself to its many rooms filled with amazingly beautifully displayed artifacts it is well worth the visit if you are in Seoul But plan to stay for at least a few hours as once you get inside you will not want to leave And there are 2 gift shops with some tastefully done souvenirs ,Positive
1434,3 floors organized into period rooms of history Especially intriqued by the Chinese ship artifact room highlighting trade items from centuries ago,Neutral
1435,For a national museum youd expect to see a lot more of Korean culture on display This museum was more about Korean history and government Since its free admission if you have time this museum would be a good time filler Otherwise for a more cultural insight into Korea check out the National Folk Museum or the National Palace Museum,Positive
1436,They have done a great job in capturing the dramatic and traumatic history of a country that has gone from a third world country to a modern economy in less than two generations,Positive
1437,This was free when I went there and I could learn a lot about korean culture and history so this is one of my top 3 museums in Korea,Positive
1438,The building is stunning and it contains artifacts to give you an idea about the history art and culture of Korea And it is free Look for the brush paintings Silla Dynasty gold crown pottery oldest calligraphy scroll huge stone pagoda armour for horses too  alos enjoyed a Korean meal in the cafe for a reasonable price,Positive
1439,You could spend the better part of a day here if you like museums Korea has a rich and long national history So much to see I liked it all,Positive
1440,I chanced upon an enthusiastic volunteer tourguide during my visit to National Museum of Korea Spent 3 hours there and he could not stop talking about different pieces and their history Time well spent,Positive
1441,Nice location  catch the subway  metro here Alot to see but most articles have none or limited english information We joined an english spoken tour and really enjoyed the volume of information about Korean history that we gained in the 2 hoursl 230 pm they had the english tour,Positive
1442,This is a very impressive building and not only were there Korean artifacts and history there was bits and pieces from all over Asia as well as a special exhibit on Islamic art and the history behind it The museum is free but the special exhibitions cost about 13000 won which I feel is a little overpriced but I really enjoyed every minute there  Note Going to a museum in Korea is not like going to a museum in any other country Ive been to children run around people talk very loudly and will block an entire exhibit If you struggle with that you may want to do what I did which is listen to music to block out the sound Doing that made it much more enjoyable for me,Positive
1443,Im always excited with the prospect of visiting a museum or any other informal learning institution for the first time There is a tingling sense of anticipation when you first see the building from a distance and as you walk up to the lobby you begin to visualise the wonders to be experienced within The National Museum of Korea was no different except that the walk to the entrance was so long that by the time I reached the building itself after being deposited at the main road by bus I was physically spent  To call the museum sprawling is an understatement Its a massive footprint and ranks among the top ten largest museums in the world Just walking from point to point including within the building will take you hours Though I never expect to finish a museum experience in one visit or however many since the experience always evolves the National Museum of Korea is particularly draining although there are some gems in the expansive collection  Its worth noting that the outdoor experience is worth checking out too but I did wished for more leisure friendly facilities like an affordable cafe Theres enough seating and water dispensers but the restaurants I stumbled on were a little pricey including the premium gift shop However I didnt have a chance to fully experience every area so perhaps I may have missed some of the facilities I was looking for  In general the museum is free to visit but special galleries may have additional charges Theres a childrens museum and the main museum consists of significant permanent galleries with changing ones too Its not too far out from downtown Seoul took me around 30 minutes by tour bus and I believe its also accessible by train do check the website The museum is somewhat sterile inside  hushed not too welcoming and ohso serious but well it is a national museum after all Even though there are lots I missed in my half day visit I really wouldnt need to go back,Positive
1444,Nice place to visit if you are interested in Asian culture The architecture of the museum is also pleasing,Positive
1445,Very spacious museum with many artifacts However not all the explanations were in available in English some videos were only in Korean,Neutral
1446,Excellent musuem for an understanding of Korean history particularly the Goreo and Joseon dynasties Beautifully laid out with some priceless treasures such as a 10 tier pagoda wonderful ceramics metal work and Buddha statues,Positive
1447,This museum was amazing to me lots to see lots to learn I was mesmerized by the level of culture that they have to offer Is extremely clean easy to navigate For those of us who do not speak Korean they have guides in several languages Go visit is free and you will have a good time I highly recomend this museum,Positive
1448,The building was just lovely But sadly not many significant artifacts here Display cases and descriptions in both Korean and English are presented beautifully and well planned Cafeteria food in the museum is good and affordable Theres a room for nursing mothers Long travelator from subway was helpful for our tired feet,Positive
1449,A bit basic and the English captions were often missing or confusing The building is very beautiful though,Positive
1450,Its a nicely laidout museum with helpful maps and some interesting items However there is FAR too much of the same thing over and over again I have a particular fondness for museums but in Korea I would recommend cycling around Gyeongju Its the best museum Korea has to offer and no walls ,Positive
1451,plan to spend at least half day and take the English tour as they explain in detail plus I spend time walking around just looking myself great history knowledge,Positive
1452,The main thing is when you travel to this end of the world you must forget about being British and relax and step into there world it turns everything magical The building is beautiful lots of storys to be told but I found it hard to understand but this was only due to me being English and not having there way of thinking but I love this country love it If you like history and have a deep understanding of it this is the place to visit,Positive
1453,museum was lovely with its massive and modern structure but information about some artifacts displayed were not too informative The food court was great offering different cuisine from italian indian thai and korean food,Positive
1454,A most wonderful introduction to this great country Spent 2 and a half hours here every minute worth it,Positive
1455,They have tours in English on the weekends and they have auto tours that you can buy for less than 2 dollars if you you want to be on your own This museum has so much to look at that you can spend hours in it and not notice Each time I visited there was always something that I had not seen before This is a great place to be when it is rainy or hot outside I would recommend this museum to people who are visiting or are staying in Korea for awhile,Positive
1456,The space is spectacular Highly recommended The exhibits are laid out imaginatively This is probably the best museum in Seoul,Positive
1457,The museum is very nice with plenty of exhibits and English explanations The museum provided an excellent description of Korean history with plenty of art and sculpture throughout the different periods of Korean history,Positive
1458,This museum contains many artifacts of Korean Life It is arranged in order of life experiences starting with early life progressing to midlife and finally funeral rites There are many displays of typical Korean clothing,Negative
1459,Lots of world class art and artifacts that give a great introduction to Korean culture The building is spectacular and its all free,Positive
1460,We never made it off the ground floor bu that is where the bulk of Korean history is displayed Easily a whole day experience or more Definitely visit,Positive
1461,This place is huge Not only does it have signs in English as well as Korean but theyre actually grammatically correct We only had time to see the first floor but it goes through the history of Korea from the Neolithic period through modern day via artifacts really interesting,Positive
1462,Very impressive museum and its free entry Vivid displays 4d video sessions and many exhibits Most impressive was the Korean War room giving background on ww2 and Korean War Ship and war planes displayed out front Dont miss this one,Positive
1463,Exciting  a school group listening in awe to a teachers story lots of placenta jars and free A really nice introduction to Korean culture In the same grounds as a palace so the full Korean experiance,Positive
1464,When you do have time to travel the whole country a visit to the Museum will provide you a good understanding of SKorea history and culture The Museum is very modern and well designed It is worth a trip there,Positive
1465,This museum is large wellorganized and has information in Englishbut I didnt find it as interesting as other places in Seoul I learned more about the culture by walking around parks visiting the Korea War Memorial Museum going to nonverbal shows in the evening and talking to folks from Seoul It was not very interactive like the War Memorial but still a great way to learn about the Korean culture and history And its free so it you dont like it you didnt lose out on anything,Positive
1466,Above average museum as they allow limited photography and their permanent exhibits are free I especially enjoyed the first floor Prehistory and Ancient History Gallery A free phone app is available that discusses the origin of Korean culture from ancient times to the Unified Silla period to the Balhae Kingdom Compared to other Seoul attractions this museum was not crowded at all,Positive
1467,It is a very interesting and valuable place to visit it not only shows their history but also a lot of excellent selection of exhibits provided by other countries and it is totally free of charge except the special exhibition in the Special Exhibition Gallery and the staff are very nice and friendly they saw my mum with the wheel chair the staff always checked us out to see whether we need help The DigitalAudioguided Tours PDAMP3 is very convenient The whole building is big and clean too it is worth to visit I did spend a whole day inside and the food inside the museums restaurant is quite expensive but the food of the little cafe outside  near the subway station is delicious with reasonable price It is a must visiting place when you stay in Seoul,Positive
1468,i love its design its a clean big and free admission museum never had kinda stuff in my country not for museum but its kinda boring if you take more than 3 hours,Positive
1469,Fascinating historical museum Excellent selection of exhibits  the sections on prehistory of Korea and Buddhist art particularly so  I also recommend the museum food court Good value and delicious Korean dished are available Useful as the museum is not close to restaurants and you could spend many hours at this museum as there is so much to see,Positive
1470,the size of the building itself is astounding if one had to see the whole collection it is 4 km of walking so it is impossible to see everything great collection of paintings and sculptures nicely spaced ut so not crowded tall pagodai in the lobby nice museum,Positive
1471,My family enjoyed their trip to the museum very much there was nothing I disliked about the place and particulary liked that there was lots of info in English for us foreign visitors,Positive
1472,The exhibits themselves are a bit thin on the ground so you dont get a very full picture of what Korean history was really like Unfortunately the Korean peninsula has often been invaded and many artifacts were stolen or destroyed by the occupiers Id still recommend the place though because is is a very nice environment to be in,Negative
1473,i like it you can see all history of korea in hall with beautiful building and easy to go there by subway to Ichon station from subway you can exit to meet to National museum of korea,Positive
1474,National Museum of Korea used to be small and not worth a visit when I was young and still living in Seoul But that has changed 180 degrees The new museum is incredibly well organized and FREE to enter for the part that is most interesting to me at least the Korean collection Just to see the Korean side Id suggest devoting at least half a day and suggest frequent rests in between as theres a lot to see The food inside is a bit on the expensive side but the Korean fast food outside the museum before the stairs to the museum building is affordable and quick if you want to eat a bite before entering and after exiting,Positive
1475,We took the Metro from down town to the Museum The museum has beautiful grounds and beautiful buildings Well worth a visit when in Seoul,Positive
1476,Weve come here on three separate occasions  one visit for each floor There are that many artefacts This is not just about Korean history either  there are pieces from all over Asia and you relaly get to see how spiritual movements and civilisations moved and changed through history There are lots of information boards in surprisingly welltranslated English as well A wonderful free excursion for a few or many hours,Positive
1477,The building and area around it is quite interesting and the collection takes you through a history of the Korean peninsula and includes some other interesting artwork and artefacts Its also not far from the centre of Seoul so worth the trip if you have any interest in history or ancient art and culture  I particularly enjoyed the free English tour The tour guide used to work for Samsung unfortunately I cant remember his name He was very friendly and provided lots of interesting information,Positive
1478,This museum covers Korean from the paleolithic period to the 5th Joseon Dynasty on the 1st floor then paintings and statues and donated works on the 2nd floor and more statues and asian art on the 3rd floor  Depending on what you liked theyve got everything covered  And a reflecting pond outside,Positive
1479,This is a serious museum for historyloving types but even for everyone else the buildings architecture alone with its soaring ceiling and the handful of massive artifacts will surely leave some lasting memories First bit of advice DONT try to see everything in one visit Simply too big; youll get tired Second if youre here for more than two hours make use of the cafe for a muchneeded break As for the exhibits be sure and see the large Buddha statues if anything; they are a nottomiss exhibit From there it all depends on you  paintings old maps ancient hardware pottery you name it you got it If youve made it all the way to Korea Id stick with the Korean exhibits especially the real ancient stuff Koryeo dynasty etc and take a good look at the National Treasures as they are the big shots in this place Otherwise as they say take in what you like and be prepared to skim past some displays cases if you come on a busy weekend hint winter weekends are popular as are childrens school holidays On your way out be sure and stock up on some memorabilia at the nicely stocked gift shop,Positive
1480,I guess you should judge a Museum by its contents primarily but it must be said that the building is quite stunning Free admission English tours and English language guide maps make a visit very easy and enjoyable I found the antiquities from Neolithic through to Silla period very rewarding some superb gold royal regalia and the usual array of stone and iron weapons and implements Large pottery display An uninformed guess would be that Korea may well still have a lot of archaeological work still to come Excellent video explanation of the construction of the funerary mounds I had just seen in Gyeongju over the previous daysMore audio visual stuff we did not explore on a short visit I did not have time to check out the arts and crafts and painting on the floors above A restaurant onsite which looked good but we patronised the food courtcoffee shop which was fine Lots of staff usual Korean courtesy and welcome,Positive
1481,A wonderful modern museum with the relics and treasures that were saved from various distructions the perfect display to get to know Korean history,Positive
1482,The building is huge and grand It is relatively sparse inside There is a comprehensive display of Korean history and artifacts from various periods It is interesting but nothing extraordinary perhaps the best thing is that it is free,Positive
1483,We loved the building  it is so large and spacious However the displays were not so interesting If you like Korean pottery and ceramics you will enjoy it We had a nice dinner in the cafe that was good value,Positive
1484,If you want to have an overwhelming experince visit the National Museum of Korea Some of the best antique gold work in the world are on display at the museum There are atrifacts from paleolithic times to the present Plan on a full day there  have lunch or dinner at one of the restaurants on site,Positive
1485,sections were neatly organized it gracefully combined history and heritage in a series of rooms clean landscape and tourist friendly,Positive
1486,Free entry and a large panorama of Korean fine culture from stone age to contemporary time via middle age \xc3\x80 must go ,Positive
1487,Im amazed with everything inside this museum Clean well organized and nice setting Most displays in Korean but thanks to the front desk guy who provide me small device for translating Korean displays,Positive
1488,Knowing a nations past and seeing how their ancient culture was provides a glimpse of how they have evolved to the culture they have today They had a well lit facility with a variety of departments to walk into They had a vast amount of artifacts that you could take pictures of and as well headsets in case ou needed a guided self tour This is definitely a must if you are a history fanatic,Positive
1489,beautiful museum in nice setting but it was ok Most of their displays were in korean so I lost interest when I got there If they want people to know about their history or culture they should display in multiple language I guess thats just me,Positive
1490,It was a very nice museum But it would have been even nicer if there were more English explanations for those of us who dont read Korean,Positive
1491,the historical artefacts the beauty of the way leading to the museaum and the museaum itself caught my fancy it is very educating,Positive
1492,Beautifully displayed objects from medieval through modern periods Delightful restaurant for lunch,Positive
1493,My husband and I made it around Seoul to see quite a few museums and this one ranks at the bottom of our list The size of this museum is the most impressive thing about it The other main positives are that its free and that there is a fair amount of English throughout it I would recommend spending more time at other museums rather than coming here,Positive
1494,dont miss this museum when you go on city tour using city tour bus one of the must see building one of the biggest museum i enter so far,Positive
1495,Our family visited the museum and found it to be exceptional historically educationally and highly accessible I recommend that you set aside an entire day for the museum,Positive
1496,very nice place to know Korean history like the architecture design food court is not bad if you want to have audio guide take your passport and credit card with your printed name,Positive
1497,History of Korean people is displayed for the people who are into anthropology this would a gold mine ,Neutral
1498,I really enjoyed this museum and learned a lot of history about Korea It will be really boring if you are not interested in museums I think its a great place for tourist and expats to spend a few hours The food court is really nice too with a variety for options and its pretty affordable You dont need a tour guide but get the electronic guide thingy,Positive
1499,As far as museums go this one is worth going to but keep in mind they are closed on Mondays You can park underground or walk from Ichon Subway Station The architecture of the building is incredible and the exhibits are wonderful There are also special exhibits which charge although the main museum is free,Positive
1500,Although a history major I do not know a lot about Korean history the museum brought me up to date with lots of artifacts with well written if stilted English descriptions Worth a look and its free,Positive
1501,Easy to spend all day here Very modern building Most of the exhibits have descriptions in English Easily accessible by subway,Positive
1502,This was part of our tout and I thought here we go But there is so much to see I was surprised I totaled enjoyed it it was great,Positive
1503,A great way to learn abour Korean Royal Dynasties history and art largely neglected in the West Beautiful view of Seoul from the plaza in front of the museum,Positive
1504,its an amazing place to see that builds so much respect in your heart for the Korean people What a nation,Positive
1505,This museum is one of the largest in the world with comprehensive displays of Korean Art and also other types of Asian Art,Positive
1506,They have a lot of stuff on exhibit since Korea has a long history The place is big but i thought the exhibits could have been presented in a more creative manner I think it was too boxy and too conventional It doesnt do enough justice to korean history and culture,Positive
1507,The building itself is impressive  I also loved the monuments outside But the museum itself was ok Its free so if you have lots of time go for it unless of course you are a history buff My boyfriend was really excited by the planes guns etc exhibits,Positive
1508,The technology used the presentation and the well kept archives Too many things to see and you need at least a day to truly absord and appreciate the displayed,Positive
1509,This is a huge museum that has something for everyone The location is a bit difficult to find without a tourist map However on arrival you could easily lose yourself inside This is one of the few places in Seoul that preserves Korean culture and doesnt exploit it,Negative
1510,Good example of interactive museum very well organised and interesting I had an afternoon before boarding the return trip may well take 1 days ifnyou have time and interested in Korean culture,Positive
1511,Its free and something to do on a rainy day which was our plan but some of the early historical halls were closed for renovation,Positive
1512,A really great museum very well organised and set out Some wonderful items Staff very friendly and helpful,Positive
1513,We were waiting to go on a DMZ tour from USO which is not far from this museum so we really were only filling in time Sadly we would have liked to have spent much more time here but what we saw we liked  a very well designed Memorial Hall Battle rooms were full of information and lots of reading to do,Positive
1514,We went for an English guided tour and found to our amazement that we were only 4 to be guided So we had an almost private tour It was very interesting to see the Crown from the Silla period the pensive Bodhisattva The museum is very open spaced and modern We give it our best recommendations,Positive
1515,The National Museum of Korea has only come into existance about three years ago but the government has done an excellent job of promoting it to the public Located on the grounds of the former 9 holes gold course of the US Army Yongsan Garrison the National Museum is well layed out and vast Many special programs take place there on a contunal basis You could easilty spend a full day there and not able to view all the works of art that are on display Rather recommend selectiveley enjoying a handful of exhibits and making several trips back in the Spring Summer Fall and Winter as the gorunds give you a different aspect to enjoy based on the seasons Well worth a trip once a quarter Enjoy,Positive
1516,The building itself is something to look at  its a no nonsense marble edifice the whole of Korea should be proud of The exhibits are well laid out The Maya exhibit is eerie but beautiful The KoreanBuddhistSilla halls are breathtaking Seeing the actual Silla crown is an experience The Asian Exhibit is really worth the 3rd floor climb The artificial lake in front is beautiful specially now in Autumn A must visit when in Seoul and its just a ride away via subway ,Positive
1517,This is the biggest museum Ive ever visited and the night I came in they also had the Mayan exhibit so it was an extra treat I like the animated Autumn \xe2\x80\x93 Autumn in Art Exhibition Movie Check out the Garden pagodas pond and waterfall before going in You can spend a good few hours here without knowing Expect to spend at least 4 hours,Positive
1518,I was guided with a very well English speaker He explained everything clearly and really it was veryvery interesting Especially if you enjoy watching Korean historical drama This museums design is also very good The collections also are amazing Especially the Buddhist sculptures Totally worth it spending almost whole day here Oh Visit the museum market too They sell historicalbutcute things Not really expensive too You can get stuff there as souvenir,Positive
1519,I spent an entire day walking through this museum If you like art history or free stuff this place is for you,Positive
1520,This museum is truly worthy of being called the national museum The setting is excellent and the design really incorporates the building within the citys landscape There are good snack and dining options and great views abound The collection is top notch and the venue is one of the best sight seeing opportunities in Seoul It is a short walk from a subway stop so it is easy to get to and it was free and open late the night we were there,Positive
1521,Not too large a museum unlike the British Museum in London But gives a fairly accurate and descriptive picture of Korean history And being located next to the palace has its merits  you can combine both vsits in one day Advise visiting the museum first before heading to the nearby palace,Positive
1522,This museum located in the Yongsan area is beautiful inside and out You can learn a lot about Korea just by visiting The museum is one Koreans take a lot of pride in and want visitors to enjoy Entrance is free for all,Positive
1523,Has only been opend a few years Be prepared to get lost 3 floors Beautifully done Found the food court a little daunting,Positive
1524,Brand new museum of amazing architecture  360 views of the city unlimited source of historical and cultural knowledge  Very well airconditioned  which makes it a great place to be in hot and moist climate,Positive
1525,It a nice walk from Myeongdong to the NMK but the exhibits were rather dry and mundane If you are interested in studying Korean history in depth its probably a ideal place but for a causal visitor it can be repetitive and confusing,Positive
1526,What a fabulous museum But be prepared to walk a lot even though there are escalators We spent 34 of a day going through the museum Before we started a 3 week long tour of S Korea we wanted to know a bit more about its history We started in the Paleolithic gallery and moved on from there It did our hearts good to see school children in the museum on field trips  there were hundreds of them We found the videos of archaeological finds and palace complexes particularly impressive plus they offered a place to sit The traditional tea shop was also very welcome a nice view overlooking a small garden along with tea and cookies  The 3rd floor is devoted to objects donated to the museum by various collectors We found those as interesting and informative as the regular exhibits  Although there is public transportation to and from the center of Seoul we took taxis which come by the outer gates of the museum frequently I would highly recommend this museum for ALL tourists,Positive
1527,We were amazed at the extensive array of artifacts at this museum Beautiful building with much to see,Positive
1528,I thought it had beautiful scenery and there was a lot to see There are different floors of the museum that have different things on each floor One floor was Korean art the other one was the rulers I would definitely go again,Positive
1529,Excellent museum highlighting cultural artifacts clothing food and historical objectsdisplays This was my favorite of the 10 or so museumshistorical sites I visited in South Korea,Positive
1530,The building which houses the museum is modern bright and well designed The museum is divided into sections on various levels and there are some coffee shops both inside and in the external part of the building,Positive
1531,The building itself is impessive and imposing The permanent collections are extensive but not overwhelming and give a great overview of ancient Korea,Positive
1532,I love national museums and have seen some truly fabulous ones This is now in my top five Beautiful modern huge complex with the various Korean themes and arts all so well presented and displayed If you want to really learn about Korea and its people this is a must visit,Positive
1533,Worth visiting just to see the building architecture Superb collections Free 2hour English tour was fantastic,Positive
1534,Free entertainment for the day and also get culturally educated at the same time The National Museum of Korea was a quite place to relax and stay warm during the winter months The layout of the Museum was logical and show cased each item clearly,Positive
1535,Firstrate modern museum covering many aspects of Korean culture Easily reached via the Seoul City Bus Tour a hop on  hop off bus Huge building with extensive historical displays as well as Korean arts and crafts Good Buddhist statues on top floor too Certainly worth a visit,Positive
1536,I only had a couple of days in Seoul but I put this on my itinerary for sightseeing in Seoul You could spend a few hours there but it is worth visiting as it offers insight into the history of Korea,Positive
1537,Make sure you reserve online before going PDA guide was great for kids,Positive
1538,But heed others advice A couple of hits and you will be antiquitiesd out Particularly enjoyed the treasures from the shipwreck on level three 30000 artifacts discovered in the 1970s off the southwest coast of Korea from a trading ship going between China and Japan  Also the museum has apparently never heard of museum pricing wonderful gifts at regular prices  The Childrens Museum was attached and while we didnt head in the familywatching at the food court between the museums was pretty interesting as well,Positive
1539,I have been here 8 years ago and I find it still very interesting They are all kept in good condition Well managed Very informative,Positive
1540,The building itself is very imposing and the collection inside is truly of national standard The various provincial museums of which I visited several in five weeks in Korea pale in comparison and a visit here almost saves you the bother The collection of porcelain especially celadon is very fine and rivals something like the Shanghai Museum but in a narrower field There are many things like recovered tumuli treasures which are appropriately presented here in the National Museum although also elsewhere Some of the donor collections tend to be fairly narrow roof tiles etc but nevertheless valuable for their dept Unmissable if you visit Seoul but not on the handiest subway line,Positive
1541,You can see ancient people living with their habbits and clothes,Neutral
1542,This is a big complex so give yourself plenty of time to visit The buildings are situated in a lovely park area refreshments are available in a cafe We used the audio only guide in English but we think the audio plus visual would have been better The exhibits are good lots of English and the audio was very informative Learnt a lot about Korean history As the museum is a far distance from the centre it is located close to a train stationbut taxis in Seoul very cheap so both methods of transport good to use,Positive
1543,The architecture is as fascinating as the exhibits and the museum is laid out very well allowing you to move through time periods sequentially The permanent displays are free and there are food facilities inside and outside One down point  there doesnt seem to be the same peaceful museum etiquette in Korea as there is in the West So expect loud adults and children alike the sound echoing around the halls with the curators doing nothing about it,Positive
1544,Nice place to get to know of Koreas History culture and see the artifacts Great collections to see,Positive
1545,It is very big museum Reserve at least two hours for this Very teaching about Korea and its history There is possibility to have some snacks and a cup of tea on the top floor,Positive
1546,Must see when in Seoul Well arranged and has a great coffee shop for a break Good museum shop too,Positive
1547,It definitely is the National Museum of Korea with relevant displays and exhibits but it is rather lackluster unless you are really fascinated with Korean Culture It is quite big and spacious and the outside of the museum is almost like a park where you can just enjoy a stroll along the pond during the late afternoon  I recommend taking advantage of the free museum guides who volunteer at certain times of the day rather than spending your money on those audio guides unless you really want to,Positive
1548,The museum was very huge and there were a lots of exihibits Those were not only from Korea but also from many Asian region Those are very interesting and I learned much about Asian history When I visited they seemed to have a special exihibition too but I had no time to enter becuase the permanent exihibition was so much I should go again,Positive
1549,The collection is very easy to visit The reasons for including artifacts is carefully explained in terms of building the Korean culture,Positive
1550,It had been recommended to us to visit the museum early in our vacation to get a taste of Korean history and culture There were absolutely right The museum was awesome and make sure to walk around the park after,Positive
1551,Once you intended to visit this place then you should spend at least two days to see most of the things in this place though this place is significantly smaller than any other museum in big countries Before plan to visit check event schedule You can watch traditional dancing or reenacting of the traditional event Its awesome and sometimes breathtaking,Positive
1552,An amazing building full of interesting facts set in a lovely park,Positive
1553,This place is huge and takes a long time to go through if you really want to see everything An afternoon is not enough to see it all Its a very interesting place and well worth the visit,Positive
1554,one or two days a week open until 21 Lot to see and good souvenir shop and food area,Positive
1555,I was surprised to read that some felt that this was a boring trip with lots of historical artifacts and nothing else Its a museum Thats what a museum is all about   I took the English tour provided twice daily with a nice man who told us about the religious history emphasized the importance of the movable metal type that they have and showed us the gold crown and gave us a detailed history on it Along with his 1 12 hour tour I spent 4 hours there and it was well worth it Go only if you are expecting history you know because it is a museum ;  Oh And it is free for the general exhibit D,Positive
