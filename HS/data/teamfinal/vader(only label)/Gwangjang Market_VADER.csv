3, 35 The price is not too expensive and it is delicious Very busy but the staff are friendly I like Yukhoe Bibimbap the most but since it has a strong seasoning I didnt notice a big difference from other ,Positive
4, Recently Netflixs program called Chefs on the Road was introduced to Seoul Gwangjang Market which is a crowded place with more foreign tourists ,Neutral
5, Food and traditional items are really cheap Much cheaper than Insadong and lots of fun ,Positive
6, Its wonderful that all the restaurants are gathered together and the atmosphere of the 80s can be seen but its too hot ,Positive
7,Will visit this market every time I come to Korea Very interesting place with lots of fantastic food options Try their traditional toast and mung bean pancakes,Positive
8, It was a happy day because there was so much variety and so much good food ,Positive
9, happy time with family was ,Positive
10, Gwangjang Market Bindaetteok is also delicious The combination of yukhoe and flavor is also excellent Im a little sad that Im going to eat more ,Positive
11,The atmosphere! Go early evening. Buzzing. Feast your eyes on local delights. Have fun with the locals. What an experience. Be prepared for your clothes to smell after! It was fun. Not the cleanest but it was all about the experience and food.,Positive
12,Probably the most memorable spot in our trip - the bowl of freshly made noodles in piping yummy hot soup is simply heavenly for a cold morning in Seoul. Plus the very friendly & sporting owner posed for a bright and cheery photo!,Positive
13,"A fun and memorable experience to go while in seoul. Tasty confort mama food. All with its unique and traditional recipe, a good food market with a lot of variations. Good prices and kind people",Positive
14,"A favorite place of ours. We go often and try new places to eat each time. You can find everything from A-Z here. Busy, crowed place. Just sit on an open chair and feast. Great prices. Once COVID a goes away things will get back to normal hopefully.",Positive
15,"This place was nothing special from other markets around South Korea.  Still worth a visit, just to take in the atmosphere. Most of the food is typical street food, recommend finding a place that has a lot of people. This usually indicates it’s a pretty good place.  There are a few Netflix famous spots, but don’t let that be your deciding factor.",Positive
16,"U can enjoy a lot of korean street food and Korea souvenir , gift , snacks , fruits are available here!",Positive
17,This traditional market is the best way to know more about the local food culture. The aroma of the korean delicacies surrounds the area where most of the food vendors were concentrated and you will be spoilt for choice at the market. We feel like a local when we sit in front of the stall to try the famous mungbean pancake which is freshly made on the spot and it taste not too bad. There are also shops that sells korean snack and souvenirs that are cheaper than the ones sold at myeongdong shopping street.,Positive
18,"Delicious netflixfamous Mungbung pancakes, steamy hot knifecut noodles from the netflixlady, dokkbokki, soondae, soju, streetfood between locals at its top with heatwarming seats",Positive
19,"Unfortunately on the second day of the lunar year, apart from the street food stalls and restaurants, only like 5 fruit stores and stores selling souvenirs and other things were open. We managed to get some probably overpriced kitchenware.  Amongst the four streets in the market, three were on food. The vibrant food stalls were interesting to visit. And yes, the benches were “hot”. The ladies and men serving were nice and there was menu in English, Chinese and Japanese. We also saw Chinese translators seemingly from the Tourist Associations standing by.  Should visit",Positive
20,"A true treasure in Seoul. I miss this place more than anything. The people, be it vendors or those who sit next to you, are incredibly welcoming and friendly. The food is incredible no matter where you go, pick what you like, but also take the advice of the friendly vendors beckoning you to their booths. Love this place dearly and you will too.",Positive
21,Loved the market as they are primarily run by local Koreans. Definitely recommend to eat at the makeshift stores like a local - the seats are heated and many sell local dumpling noodles which make it so satisfying to have during the winter.  This is also the place where you can visit the store which appeared on Netflix’s “street food”. Recommend to have the mung bean pancake and beef tartare.  Should definitely visit this place as it is near to Dongdaemun as well so you can always head there after this market,Positive
22,"Lots of stalls selling common street food. Extremely crowded and be prepared for lots of shoving and pushing. Found a stall selling fish shape pancake or waffles. The couple manning the stall were very organised and thoughtful. Their pancakes had only three types of fillings - red bean, custard or pizza. Tried all three and would personally recommend the custard filling. They were very generous with the filings.",Positive
23,"From Dongdaemun subway station, it was approx.15-min walk to market. We went on Jan.1, and the market was busy, packed with people. There were some stalls closed, but many were still open. Market has lots of food options, and things to buy, so you can spend hours there!",Neutral
24,A local market where you can find many authentic Korean food and shops selling souvenirs and snacks. Price are affordable. Sellers are friendly. Love it!,Positive
25,We went on New Year’s Day so only the food stalls and a few snack and clothing stalls were open. The oil stench was strong from all the mug bean pancakes and there are dozens of stalls selling pretty much the same thing but we were too I adventurous to sit down especially when we have just had lunch an hour before that. The last thing you want is to horde a couple of seats and not consume enough.,Positive
26,"Great place to have lunch. If you want to try transitional cuisine, that’s the place. There are plenty options in a super affordable price. Loved it, specially the dumplings!!!!",Positive
27,"The street food at this market is amazing, weather was cold when we were there but still great to eat at one of the street stalls, seats were heated, so many different stalls with so many different street foods, tourists everywhere taking photos, this is a great stop for tourists and locals a like.",Positive
28,"C ( 19.11.29 ) Though Kwangjang Market had various item, but there was famous for Korean street food, Korean-style raw beef, mung-bean pancake, gimbap, and so on. If want to eat Korean street food, there was very good market to enjoy it. The inside road was small and many people was crowded. The price was nor expensive for trying food. The gourmet traveler must visited there.",Positive
29,Don’t miss this place as you will find all the flavors the food and the Korean atmosphere! You can shop and take away or eat inside on small casual tables it’s so genuine!,Positive
30,"I think it is the beat food market in South Korea!!! So much great food you need to try, I would recommend coming here more than one so you can try everything",Positive
31,"If you want taste authentic Korean foods as locals eat, you must go to Kwangjang Market. No where can beat this place for its variety and price. I ate there siting on narrow bench in very crowded center aisle. It was quite an experience. Fried sweet rice pancakes are very good. If you see many local people waiting in line for some food, just try it too. You have to visit this place when you are in Seoul because it is very difficult for tourist to find those traditional Korean food else where in the city.",Positive
32,This is a very cool place to visit. Lots of different things to see. I recommend it! Just walking around is neat,Positive
33,"I love this place because there are a lot of Korean food here. I ate bibimbap and teokbokki, but the taste was not really good. Somehow I still love the place because you can feel the traditional of Korea and how the local interact with each other.",Positive
34,"Kwangjang market is a really good cultural experience of Seoul - it's busy and noisy and a bit smelly sometimes and the food looks like nothing you would ever see in Europe! It's a great place to wander round even if you aren't brave enough to eat there - and yes, you can see the lady from the Netflix series...",Positive
35,This market isn’t as busy as Namdaemun market but is fully enclosed. The stalls are pretty repetitive but variety of food is still good nonetheless.,Positive
36,The market was an interesting experience to see and try out the korean street food! It is a bit crowded especially around lunch and dinner time but I think it’s worth visiting. Make sure to try the food there!!,Positive
37,"As food markets or night markets go, this one is no more than average. It is part of a larger produce, fish, chicken and meat (and some clothing) market.  Its obvious advantage is that it is covered and so a reasonable destination even in inclement weather. It also has two clear disadvantages: 1- the variety of food served is very limited. You have stall after stall serving the exact same thing. 2- the aisles are narrow. We were there late afternoon on a weekday, and there were spots where passage was difficult. I wonder whether passage becomes more difficult in the evening or on weekends.",Negative
38,"Anyone who saw Netflix street food will recognise Yoonsun Cho. The lady who makes and sells knife cut noodles and Mandu in Kwangjang Market Seoul. Since the show she’s busier than ever but still make and serve the most delicious food. We loved the kimchi in particular. The green kimchi was fresh and different, delicious.  We learnt that some of the market traders are jealous of her fame, they need to grow up as she attracts more people from around the world.  The mungbean pancakes was also absolutely outstanding. The market is large and offers plenty of choices. Lots of blood sausage, bibimbap, gimbap and plenty other extraordinary delicious Korean specialities worth trying.  The market is also well know for steak tartar. The soy sauce pickled crabs are delicious.  The market also offers clothing and homewares but definitely worth visiting for the food!  It’s a bus place, be patient and go with the flow you will have an amazing time!",Positive
39,Whole long stretch of street food where u find live squid as well. Egg pan cake is a little bit oily but is very delicious. This place is very special where u can order food and sit in front of the small stall to eat. Price is reasonable. Next to the main food street there are some stalls selling cloths and sports stuff.,Positive
40,"We can’t get enough of the mung bean pancake. We had it twice during our visit. We also loved the mini kimbap. Their bibimbap was also quite good. If we go back to south korea, we are definitely including this market again in our itinerary. piannskitchen.com",Positive
41,We visited by subway station Jongno 5-ga.It is 50 metres from the station.There are lots of food stalls selling multiple local dishes.We chose a family run fish restaurant that was popular with local people.We had kimchi chilli and cabbage starters and spicy pollock roe stew which blew our heads off much to the amusement of the Koreans.We communicated in sign language.Luckily they sold cold beers.A great experience.,Positive
42,"Was initially a bit confused and intimidated by the setup but eventually found it be a very way to discover new food. Not sure who is buying the clothes on sale but the food stalls definitely attract lots of customers. Just need the guts to sit down at one of the places and give the offerings a try. Seems to be segmented a bit by seafood, noodles, etc. Ended up having delicious food for very little money. Food stalls were closing up fast at 3PM when we were there so get there early enough to have options.",Positive
43,"We went there as part of our ""explore Seoul"" trip and it was worth it! The atmosphere and energy were unmatched. The ox head meat made it worth the hassle!",Positive
44,"My family sat at a stall that was empty at the time (but as we finished our lunch all the empty chairs were almost full). Tried the great spicy tteokbokki and shared some mandu (dumplings), gimbap, fish cakes and bibimbap. Perhaps not the best food I ate during my stay, but very decent.  The issue I saw was that most food vendors seemed to serve the same dishes and although I can’t compare their cooking styles, this fact would make me think twice to return. When we went to see the Myeongdong Nanta show all the street vendors were offering their innovative cuisine in the streets (including lobster with cheese) and all the stalls offered something different. I wish this market offered that (or at least some type of) dish variety.",Positive
45,"One of our stops on the night tour was the Gwangjang Market where some of my family members were brave enough to try eating live octopus. I was not even brave enough to sit at the same table with them. I did try their famous pancakes from one of their vegetarian stalls and was mildly impressed. The best find for me in this market was their donuts. The line was long but moved fast. They could not make them fast enough. My family went back for seconds. If you are ever in this market go for the freshly made donuts (its soaped long instead of round), the taste is worth every calorie. You can watch it being made as well. Priced moderately.",Positive
46,Easy to find from subway exit 9. This market is busy with food stalls & lots of variety. An excellent way to try a little of different korean foods. Other stalls for a whole range of products & goods. Various lanes of stalls spread out so you come back to a central point then take the next avenue.,Positive
47,"We watched Netflix show about street food of Seoul and it was a must do and see for us when we visited Seoul last week. We managed to find the stall from the show which makes the famous mung bean pancakes 🥞. The market was so big and it felt like it wasn’t ending. You can find anything there: food, clothes, fabric, sea food ... it’s definitely a must visit in Seoul as you will experience a real Korean culture.",Positive
48,"The Kwangjang (sometimes spelled Gwangjang) market is a real foodie heaven. Many resources on the internet say it closes at 6PM and this may be true for many of the shops, however the food scene seems to be going strong at least until 10:00 PM. Here you will find many street food classics such as mung bean pancakes, Korean blood sausage, dumplings, steak tartare, fresh octopus and many others. All menus are in English, I don’t see why you would book a tour to come here to eat - read up on the Korean street food dishes and venture out on your own - I met several nice Koreans as I was hoping from stall to stall who was very friendly and wanted to share their food culture and their Soju with a total stranger. Geonbae!",Positive
49,"Came here for the knife cut noodles and mung bean pancakes. Loads of shops selling hanboks, traditional decorations and snacks.",Negative
50,"Street food markets always represent the beating heart of a country. Here, in Gwangjang Market, you can find the true traditional korean food. There is a lot of attractive food; try as much as you can in order to have the most genuine experience possible!",Positive
51,Street food in abundance. Live fish for sale and local delicacies (unidentifiable to me). Sitting at a stall or one of the rooms is probably better than getting a take-away as the 'to go' option involves a lot of plastic and polystyrene packaging.,Positive
52,worth a visit to check out the food. didn’t spend that much time here but my favourite stall was the kalguksu (knife-cut wheat flour noodles in soup) and mandu (dumplings) stall made famous by the netflix street food show (happy to report that it is worth the hype and the possible wait for seats as it’s now a hot spot for foreigners thanks to the show). it’s also a good place to shop for fabrics if that’s what you’re looking for!,Positive
53,This market is more about food than other stuff. You can try a lot of diffrent food. If you are around you should try to eat there!,Neutral
54,Big markets. Lots and lots of stalls. Dry goods. Cooked food. Textiles. Linen. Toys. Souvenirs. Korean craft. Good to explore especially during rainy day since it is covered. The textile sections on ground and upper floor is enough to make you lost. All good price. Don’t miss out the food stores. We had the noodle and dumpling at one of the Netflix street food featured stores. Not disappointed.,Positive
55,Went specifically because I watched on Netflix. Found the noodles and dumpling stall and the crab stall. Both amazing. Really good food from wonderful hardworking people.,Positive
56,"Fantastic market with heaps of small street food stalls. Pretty big area covering the block, heaps of stalls to walk around and can sit down to each at eat. Heaps of variety, catering for truly Korean food. Very tasty and fresh.",Positive
57,"Gwangjang market is a traditional Korean / Asian market. Lots of stalls selling all kinds of edible products, some raw some cooked. A great Street food location or buying some fresh fruit.",Positive
58,"You are spoilt for choice in the market for eateries. The centre food court has many small stalls that offer pancakes, noodles, rice rolls, live octopus, and more pancakes and more noodles. You can also purchase fresh vegetables, seafood and other raw food for your own cooking as it is a market. Another interesting thing to buy is cloth. Rolls and rolls of colourful and beautiful cloth are for sale here with many shops owners trying to make a living.",Positive
59,"Gwangjang market is the place to see the locals do their daily marketing. Besides the usual tteokbokki ( spicy ricecakes), you should try the fried mungbean pancakes, served with a delicious soy sauce onion dip. This market caters to the locals, so it is as authentic an experience watching Korean people buy and sell. A food paradise for people who love to eat or cook.",Positive
60,"Lots of great shopping and a huge center food court. Great fun, clean, reasonable prices. Loved the clean bathrooms.",Positive
61,"What a colourful and sense evoking experience with so many things to eat, smell, see and be a part of! A fabulous market. The kimchi dumplings and mung bean pancakes were amazing! Some good options if you are vegetarian.",Positive
62,"This place is a must see to in my book. I had a Seoul Korean native who lived in the States for 25 years give me a tour after moving back to Seoul for the past 11 years. Took me places that tourist would NEVER see and many Koreans don’t even know about it. This was one of his stops and gave me the history of the Market and how it grew and expended over decades. This is the largest traditional Korean markets and is known for food, silk and anything you want to find. You can also book a tour through TripAdvisor",Negative
63,"Went with my brother to have a good experience as seen online. One of the food stall owners was very pushy and persuaded us to sit down after saying she'd give us ""service"" (free food). We ate some and asked if we could take the rest of the food away as we wanted to leave quickly, still thinking it was ""service"". Also important to note I spoke Korean though I'm not 100% fluent. I was quite naive, and at this point she added more food that we didn't ask for. I then asked how much this would all be(as it was a lot for free food) and she told me it was 16,000won. I then felt pressured into paying because she purposefully gave us a lot of food without asking. The stall owner was very old and our Korean wasn't good enough to argue with her. My brother was also feeling sick. At the time, there were a lot of people as well as the weather being very rainy and humid, so we just wanted to get away as soon as possible. Make sure to be very firm with what exactly you want to eat and always ask straightaway as to how much the food will be or make sure that the food is still ""service"" if offered.",Positive
64,"Great Market Place to experience local culture & food. Many tastes of local Korean food like the Korean pancake, noodles, kimchi, gimbap, seafood & etc. Dry preserved seafood can also be found there. The other side of the market is fabric area which closes in the evening after the food market comes alive. Walk around Jungno-gu you can also find fruits & flower markets.",Positive
65,Tried all the 3 shops that were featured on Netflix. Loved the experience.  Netflix 1 Dimsums @ 5000 KRW were delicious 2: The raw crab in soya (very expensive 20000 KRW) for a small crab. 3. Pan cake (average - nothing special)  the experience and the atmosphere is super.,Positive
66,"This one of Korea’s largest traditional markets, with one section selling authentic Korean street food. It is crowded with tourists as well as locals along the narrow alleys. For some stalls, there are some seats for customers who ordered pancakes, Korean dumplings, braised pig's trotters, gimbap, seafood, etc. If you are adventurous, you can try the raw octopus tentacles.  There are also stalls selling fruit, vegetables, meat and fresh seafood. I purchased some apples and peaches, which were rather expensive. Suggest you buy fruits from other places.",Positive
67,"No, this is not an upscale, ultra-clean chain department store where credit cards are king -- it is a market with numerous food stalls are centered along the walkways and sellers of fish, produce, silk, souvenirs, kimchi, housegoods and junk line the walkways. For me, all the food looks alike but obviously some are better than others as they are very busy and others have no customers. When in Seoul, one really has to visit -- not necessarily buy, but at least visit.",Positive
68,"If you want to taste local street food easily, Gwangjang market should be one of your stop in Seoul. Easy, tasty and cheap.",Positive
69,"I went there with my korean friend and we tried raw beef dish and korean pancake, which is the popular dish of Gwangjang market. Both were delicious especially korean pancake. I loved it really. It is worth to mention that the vibe and atmosphere there was amazing. It was a bit crowded but that what you should expect to be in local market. There are many things for you to try there, so it is better to go with friends so you can try more dishes.",Positive
70,"It is really just a market solely focused on FOOD! Wonderfully authentic and delicious Korean Food! The shop keepers are very friendly and welcoming and can speak a multitude of languages ranging from english, chinese and japanese, so communication really shouldn't be a problem no matter where you're from. All the food is fresh or made on the spot and you can see them prepare it. You can either take away the food or sit down at the stalls themselves to enjoy the food items. Price wise, it isn't expensive at all and you are utterly spoiled for choice of what to eat at Gwangjang market. There is a lot to see and observe and is a definite must-see location when in Seoul. I'd personally recommend ordering the kimbap, japchae, jajamyeon, pumpkin porridge, tobeokki and the kimchi pancakes!",Positive
71,It's like a food market where you can buy street food and walk along the street to find more food. Nothing special unless there is a specific food stall that you want here.,Negative
72,"If you love traditional Korean food, this is your heaven. Don’t miss the kalguksu stall owned and operated by Yoonsun Cho, covered in Netflix’s Street Food. Yum!",Positive
73,"It's a nice traditional market to look and walk around, but the food section is very crowded and the food selections are actually very similar although there are many stores, and the food vendors would keep trying to sell you their food and may come off as pushy and aggressive which I really felt uncomfortable with. The food selections are mainly street foods such as tteokboki, mandu, fishcake etc, the mung bean pancake I tried was average.",Negative
74,"I was brought by my friend to see this local market. There are a lot of food stores, selling a variety of products. In the east side of the market, there are a lot of food vendors selling mungbean pancakes to cold noodles. On the second floor (or first floor if you are British/European), there are vendors selling traditional Korean wedding dresses (similar to Hanbok) and also second hand clothing.",Positive
75,Mung bean pancakes for lunch - yum. Shame you have to find a corner to eat them. This market is a food heaven as long as you can stand the crowds. There are some alleyways around - go for a wander and you will find some hidden treasures.,Positive
76,"5 sectors in this market: 1) food 2) clothing 3) Daily necessities 4) dried food and titbits n fruits 5) wet markets for seafood. Love the dumplings from one stall right at the end of the food alley. Many aunties are selling similar food but depending solely on each skill to attract patrons. The other alley are stalls selling korean costumes and modern clothings. You should bargain, but not too much. Another alley has stalls selling daily necessities, like towels, scrub towels, etc. And another alley has stalls selling the different types of titbits like seaweed cracker, seaweed, almonds. There is also another alley like wet market, selling seafood and dried fishes.",Positive
77,"We came here for lunch and entered on the textile entrance of the market. About halfway into the building is when we finally started to see the food stalls. The first stop was a fish cake stall where we ordered two, each W1000. Both came impaled on a stick along with a cup of broth. Both types of fish cakes were decent and the soup was flavorful.  We were still on the hunt for a good lunch spot when we came across a stand with a large photo of Netflix on it. It turned out to be one of the vendors, Yoonsun Cho, showcased on an episode of Street Food. It was food stall #70 and had one of the largest seating areas which was a stand-alone stall surrounding the cooking and prep areas compared to all the others we walked by. We had to wait about ten minutes before a bench opened to accommodate the whole family. During the interim we watched her make some of her hand cut noodles and prep a number of bowls. Everything we tried was very good from the kimchi mandu to the hand cut noodle and the cold buckwheat noodles (we ordered spicy but it didn’t pack much heat). Overall they ran a very efficient operation for the lines of people wanting to eat here and the food was reasonably priced at W5000 each for majority of the menu items.  There also was a mung bean fried cake vendor featured on Netflix but we were too full to give hers a try.  The market was crowded and together with all the frying the temperature got a little warm inside.",Positive
78,"The food section of the market was still buzzing at 7 pm on a Friday, other sections were mainly shutting down or closed. We stuffed down hand pulled noodles by the Netflix celebrity, washed down with rice beer, gimbap, tteokbokki and live baby octupus. Would definitely visit again and allot more time for discovery.",Positive
79,There are a lot of Korean local food and I'm not surprised that they are not that hygienic. The market itself is too crowded and I don't feel comfortable with it.,Negative
80,"Many stalls selling the same things, so pls read up or watch Netflix before going over. Have to try the mung beans pancake and knife noodles and dumplings. Go where the locals eat!",Positive
81,"The food here was great, I had the mung bean pancake. Apart from the food, this place is super crowded and the shops are pretty much the same shops you see all over the city.",Positive
82,"Although I hadn’t seen the Netflix special about this market, I loved the food and the fact that it’s not a tourist market. Well not yet 😳 Yes we ate at the now famous store and had dumplings which were amazing.",Positive
83,You can find lot of street foods here. These are the korean traditional food. Recommended to visit to have a good experience on the street food.,Positive
84,Full of local korean food like real live octopus!! A must try in Seoul!  This is also the best place to buy food gifts to bring home. Bargain!!,Positive
85,"I came here for some souvenir shopping which was very successful, but my mind was blown by the food court. I wish I had been as careful as I was with the souvenir shops, not buying at the first store because the deeper I got into the food court the better looking the food got, but I was already full! The fried pancake filled with pork, sold right in the crux of the market was delicious. My daughter and I had fruit slushes out on the street side, but had we stayed toward the middle there were many more flavors available. Great atmosphere and great prices. Not much bargaining going on.",Positive
86,"A MUST visit if you are into following media tracks such as KD drama and other popular places. We went to this market to try NETFLIX handmade star :)  The noodles were springy and yummy! The entire process can be seen right in front of you. dumpling and noodle making. As simple as 3 cauldrons to cook everything to serve people who would wait in 3 layers behind the stools.  We had the handmade noodles (5000Won) and the mixed dumplings (5000Won) Both simple but for some reason we ended up going back the next day to have it again. Simplicity at it's best  Note the stall is near the south gate (stall # 70). If there's something worthy to add, try to find the place along the middle of the walk way as everyone practically sells the same thing but it is only this stall who the overflowing customer (the magic of media). this means the other stalls are not so keen in helping out find her.  before you leave, don't forget to buy some of the local KR crackers (Yummy) and kimchi - ALL TYPES! There are a lot of souvenirs too for giveaway though price is not that different from Myeongdon...maybe 100 to 200Won cheaper.",Positive
87,"Local market full with various local food. Price is not cheap but not expensive. Reccommend to walk around before make your decision because almost shops there have same food but some different menu. Not only food but have others like cloth, souvenir, etc.",Positive
88,Lot’s of good food and too crowded also its one of korea’s old market thats why its a landmark tourist must visit when they go to seoul south korea.,Positive
89,Good for street food but way too crowded.  The markets in Japan are so much better and well organized.  Worth the visit tho for the food. Try blood sausages and pig foot.,Positive
90,The market is full of snacks and other items that can be great souvenirs. It also has things for the home if your living in Korea. The best thing about it is its delicious traditional Korean food. Definitely try the knife cut noodles and mandu. The mung bean pancake is good too. It tastes like a thick hashbrown. I would definitely recommend this place in the spring or fall,Positive
91,I came here directly from the plane. It was a very nice visit. I bought a few packets of snacks and had wonderful food that were freshly prepared and piping hot. Price-wise : very very reasonable. I would definitely come here again. It was really nice and vendors are nice and not at all pushy.,Positive
92,"Very nice train station and very accessible. Busy market with lotsa local food, go there with an empty stomach to try the local food. Sells fresh fruits and kimchi, also local souvenirs and snacks to bring back as gifts. Many stalls selling similar snacks and food though. Must try the mung bean pancakes and chilled vegetable gelatins.",Positive
93,"When we visited, my husband and I were looking to buy hanboks. We entered a building where they were selling hanboks and the first stall didn't have the style I wanted. But she motioned for us to follow her.  She left her stall and ran (with all 7 of us following her) to another shop just to help me find the hanbok I wanted. We ended up purchasing from the shop she took us to, then we went back to purchase my husband's hanbok from her shop.",Positive
94,This place sells all kinds of korean local traditional food. Tourists and locals frequent this place.,Neutral
95,You will find ecerything from this market. It is all cheap and you can find also the traditional things like hanbuk their traditional clothes,Positive
96,"Gwangjang market was our go to brunch destination. They offer things from spices to fresh seafood, pickled food to textiles. But let’s be honest, my only reason for going there is to eat.  So many rows of food stalls and so many things to choose from. We had to come back twice to sample all the food we wanted. I love the meat/mung bean pancakes, the kalguksu with mandu. You can also get the live octopus (sannakji) here. Oh and don’t forget to try the hotteok (honey pancake)👌.  Get off at Jongno 5-ga station or Euljiro 4-ga station  Happy eating!",Positive
97,Come early to soak in the busy market sounds & smells. Great range of merchandise from socks to hanboks. Interesting restaurants selling live octopus & raw beef. Supposed to be a local delicacy. Good range of banchan to buy home as edible souvenirs. I love my pickled sesame leaves.,Positive
98,Well as they say it’s a must try so at this market you will have many chances to try  We tried it at this place and although not my favourite I can say I’ve had it  Lots of snacks and pancakes to try too,Positive
99,"We went to Gwangjang Market in the morning. Lots of food stalls selling similar stuff. Tried the mung beans pancake and it’s delicious. We went in a group so that we can try a bit of this a bit of that as portions are big.  There’s also live octopus... but we didn’t enjoy it so we didn’t order this time. Overall, good place to spend an hour or two.",Positive
100,"Gwangjang Market is very busy and now it seems the owners have learned to take advantage of this.  I went into an accessory shop to buy my niece a few things for her first birthday. The ahjumma quoted me a price of 46,000₩. While she went to the back to get a plastic bag for me, I placed a 50,000₩ note on the counter. I turned to look at a few more items while she was packing my things. My back was turned away from her, and she tells me I gave her 5,000₩ instead of 50,000₩.😲  I know for certain I had two 50,000₩ notes with me because I had just gone to the ATM and withdrew them.  I asked her if she had CCTV in her store...and of course, she didn't. Her ""friend"" another ahjumma store owner (conveniently) walked up and said she was watching the entire time and a money switch was not possible.  The whole situation was sketchy and it seems like these ladies do this as often as possible.  I suppose I could have called the police, but without CCTV, I felt I really didn't have a choice but to leave....without my 45,000₩.  So....shoppers beware. NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU'VE LIVED IN KOREA and even though you believe Korean people don't steal....never, ever, ever....leave your money on a counter.  In my 10 years here, I never thought this could happen....glad my lesson only cost me $45.🤷‍♀️🤦‍♀️🙅‍♀️",Neutral
101,"As I left the Shilla hotel I thought to check my walking itinerary for the day with the concierge and she recommended that while walking from ddp plaza to cheeong stream that we stop at this popular market. It did not disappoint. There is a gorgeous inner 2floor market for custom made Hanbok. This would be the place to go! We got to eat all of the night market street foods, did awesome souvenir shopping and we wanted to eat all here in this one market too.",Positive
102,This is a hugh marketplace selling all sorts of goods. If you are looking for affordable Korean souvenirs and gifts then you may want to pay a visit here and the kimchi prepared and sold by the ajumas (in sealed bags of 1/2 or 1kg packs) taste so good. There are also plenty of delicious traditional Korean food stalls lined throughout the entire place. The Hotteok (mugbean pancake is a must try here!),Positive
103,It’s crazy in a positive way by walking through the food market on weekends. The live cooking looks so amazing and the food is so fabulous!,Positive
104,"Basically a market that has everything you need to see, to buy and to eat. All under one roof. A good stop before heading home. Buy all you need, pack and say see you again Seoul!",Positive
105,"I love markets, and have been to many all over the world. This one might be my favorite. Spend an hour browsing, then pick the spot to eat that you think looks best. Order some food and Soju. You will be happy.",Positive
106,"The two markets I visited in Seoul were Namdaemun and Gwangjang, both on a Saturday. I enjoyed Gwangjang the most. It was more crowded, especially in the afternoon. The street food style eating is much better than Namdaemun. There is everything you could want. We ate bimbap and tteokbokki while seated on a heated bench; 3000 won each and generous. At another stall, we ate a honey pancake. Delicious! Walked around for a couple of hours, including across the street where there are many climbing gear shops. Expensive, but fun to browse. One even serves beer and coffee. Look for the one called “mygear”. Vas’s beer in a 16 oz glass is 3000 won. Coffee made to order. Very nice host. I would come back again and would recommend to friends.",Positive
107,"Abundance of food, price very reasonable. this market also sells clothing and household stuff. Must go!",Neutral
108,"The market is one of the oldest and largest traditional markets in South Korea, with more than 5000 shops built around 1957 and 1959. Sells all food, house hold products at a very reasonable price.",Neutral
109,This area is frequented by locals.  You get to feel to local atmosphere in this market than the other markets in Seoul.  Traditional Korean food is must to be experienced here.,Neutral
110,Checking off my bucket list of eating live octopus... this place is filled with delicious made to order food.,Positive
111,"This place is accessible and offers several Korean food at affordable prices. The aunties are nice too. The market also sells other things than food, but I believe most tourist go for the food.",Positive
112,"We were so looking forward to this. It did disappoint. May be because we were there in Feb, but we found it a bit lame. There is nothing special at this market that we can get anywhere else in Seoul. There is nothing really that would make us go there again.",Negative
113,"It's a huge market, fill with hanbok and clothes selection. Venture to the other side for hundreds of store selling the same thing. Pick your favorite auntie or lady and enjoy the food",Positive

115,"There are many stores offering local food. If you hope to have some Korean food, it is the best place to go. However, the environment is quite worrying since the market is quite dirty and lacks enough cleaning facility. I am afraid of the tableware is not clean.",Neutral
116,"A great place to sample the culinary delights of Korea. A must visit but it can be hot in the summer, which is why then the Juice stands are mandatory. Highly, highly recommend. Be brave and try the live octupus, we wimped out!",Positive
117,"We went on a tour with a local guide and found the market to be lively on a Sunday night. There was plenty of food and drink to choose from. I recommend anything fried & try something you might not have eaten on a regular day - mine was a kimchi mini crab! You can sit on the heated seats and enjoy the company of other travelers or take your food to-go. The smells will remind you that you are in old school Korea, and probably that you're hungry! Plan to spend at least two hours here eating and touring the shops. Take cash as it's easier and quicker to pay in won.",Positive
118,"Whether you like Korean food esp Korean street food or not, you will still enjoy this place. I recommend weekdays than weekend esp Sunday. some places closed on Sunday yet still lots to see and try.... be aware of crowds on Sundays, the market has very narrow street due to heaps of stalls there.  hustle and bustle for sure and heaps of street food and traditional Korean rice wine as well.",Positive
119,Loved this market where you can get chicken feet and octopus:) The vendors were nice and it was tasty.,Positive
120,"I like this place! You can try many local foods here with affordable price. My recommendation is Dakbal (boneless chicken feet) it’s VERY delicious! Ah, and a little bit spicy but not too much 😊",Positive
121,"Took bus from MyeongDong to market for lunch and bought Korean snacks e.g. rice crispies mixed with honey and nuts, fresh rice cakes. Ate gimbap, raw octopus, crispy fried pancakes in one of the stalls. Squatted like a local to eat blood intestines, liver, lungs etc. Market specialised in selling blankets, fabric and winter blankets (which I was told can be vacuum sealed back home).",Positive
122,Excitement in the air as this place is bustling with lots of activities. Good food as well! Highly recommend this place. A stall with a sign that says ‘Best Millet pancake in Korea’. Got to try .. locals Q for this food. I guess they can’t be wrong. stall is at the North 2nd gate. This is just one of the many good food in this place....,Positive
123,"Absolutely loved our experience here. So many food options including dumplings, mung bean pancakes fish, doughnuts, red bean crepes, soups and everything in between. Go hungry! Would highly recommend",Positive
124,"My partner and I had an afternoon free while in Seoul, and after checking some possibilities decided that Gwangjang Market appeared to be within a decent walking distance from our hotel on the western edge of Myeongdong.  Using our trusty Google maps we set off... and what a journey that turned out to be. For some reason we found Google maps (normally very reliable wherever we travel...) tended to get a bit confused at times around Seoul...) to take us on a somewhat weird path to Gwangjang Market... down a variety of minor streets and laneways... on and on we walked, and walked, and walked... until FINALLY we located Gwangjang Market, and what we THOUGHT was a main entrance, off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street, so we entered.  It is an indoor market, BUT... all we could see were aisles and aisle of what seemed to be mainly fabric, bedding, manchester, linen etc. shops and stalls, AND... they were almost all closed! What a disappointment, after having followed Google for maybe 25 minutes around strange streets. This certainly is a large market, somewhat along the lines of Chatuchuk Market in Bangkok. We checked down various aisle/passageways/arcades, but just more of the same, and virtually nothing open. But they weren't the types of stalls/shops we thought we would find here anyway.  After several minutes of checking out various arcades, we were about to give up, when we decided to checkout way down the other end of a very long aisle of shops where there appeared to be some kind of a food shop open. And Hey Presto...!! Here was what we were looking for.  It turns out the Gwangjang Market is more huge than we thought, and that there are apparently two main areas. The first being the more commercial area that we had encountered (off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street), and then at the other end of this huge complex, AND... with its own main entrance off Dongho-ro Street, was the market we thought we were to be visiting. Lots of unique food stalls and street food, bric-a-brac, fruit and vegetables, a huge variety of drink and ice-cream shops and stalls etc. etc. This part of the market is a huge market in its own right. And this part of the market was VERY busy when we visited. It appears to be more popular with the locals, with families buying treats, food, ice-creams etc. for their children, tourists sampling the street foods etc.  From what we could gather, the more commercial part that we initially entered into is apparently only open certain hours or days of the week, whereas the part we now found ourselves in is apparently open every day. Eureka...! It wasn't a wasted day after all.  I love to sample street food items in whatever country I am visiting, so this section of Gwangjang Market certainly provided a wide variety of options.  Gwangjang Market is definitely worth a visit if you have a couple of hours to spare, excluding your travel time to get there. You could probably get away with an hour there, or you could easily stretch it out to at least two hours.  Oh... and regarding travel time... We departed Gwangjang Market via the Dongho-ro Street entrance, and THIS TIME Google maps presented us with a much more direct, and more obvious route back to our hotel, which we could have done in almost half the time on the outward journey... except that we dropped off in the Myeongdong shopping streets for another look around, and to get dinner.",Positive
125,"When we were there, the locals definitely outnumbered tourists, which is a good thing. The buffet breakfast in our stomachs allowed us to take our time watching what eateries the locals were patronizing. They know what's good, so I'm following them. Obviously, we can't read Korean, so I just took pictures (see attached). The best pancakes seemed to be the one with the orange sign (says since 1994). We sat in front on the benches with tables, enjoyed our 4000 Won pancake while watching customers go in & out of the dine-in restaurant. Plus, many locals were buying takeaway plastic containers of uncooked pancake mix. Amazing, it's that popular! Then 2 different stall owners told us to eat the 2500 Won Japchae (transparent noodles with sesame oil and soy sauce) from this lady at stall #41. We just sat on stools holding our plates and watched this endless line of folks buying the 3 things they sold. We were also impressed how the 2 ladies left their money sitting in 2 bowls for all to see and everyone stayed honest!",Positive
126,"Great market with many interesting selection of food although most sell the same items. You have to be here with empty stomach else is like walking in casino. Hope you can get the most yummy store! Please note that sun a lot of retail stores is closed, but crowded for the food alley :) Yum!",Positive
127,I went to Gwanjang Market for the local food and I was overwhelmed by the choices and the crowd (both locals and tourists). Better decide what you wanted to eat before going there for dinner since this seems to be peak time. Take outs are possible though so you can just buy to go.,Positive
128,"I love this market. It's with full of nice yummy food. You just can't decide which stall that you should sit and eat. But, it's all the same on every stalls that offers. The food is super yummy and fresh.",Positive
129,"This is a good stop to finish your day, try some local food (and by this I mean what koreans eat everyday), and, in the meantime, do some bargain souvenir shopping.  The place is crowded and you’ll have to navigate yourself trough people and stands, but, all in all, if markets are part of your interest, it’s worth a short visit.",Positive
130,Gwangjang Market near to Ihwa Mural Village. Lots of local foods here and the taste is quite good. I bought kimchi from here because the ajumma let us try n the taste is good.,Positive
131,"Great experience for tourists visiting Korea. Various food stalls located in the middle of the market, do try them, the food there is generally tasty as well.",Positive
132,"Gwangjang market is one of the oldest traditional markets and is is fun to visit. It is packed with many food stalls selling street food, fruit,vegetable meat and fish shops and also shops selling kitchenware, textiles, clothing and more. One of the popular items sold in the food stalls is the mung bean pancakes. These are deep fried and cut in pieces - making it easy to eat with chopsticks and you can dip it in soy sauce. I thought it looked greasy but it was delicious!",Positive
133,"Well, basically a covered local market, where you can buy everything you need and don’t need ;-) However, it is also a place with many small food stalls, where you can get local meals for a reasonable price. Many locals Fettheit lunch here. Everything looks perfectly clean, so we had no concerns at all to sit down on one of the small benches and get something to eat, it was very good.",Positive
134,"If you are looking for local food, this is a must visit place. There are plenty of food stalls in the market and you will be spoilt for choices here. The Korean pancake is one of the more popular choices of food here.  The other point for this market is definitely its fabric shops. This is literally the place to shops Fabric especially the famous Korean Silk. You have to walk through the market to find the best bargain and I can tell you its gonna be a long walk coz the market is so huge.  Its open in the morning and to go here, you can take subway Line 1 and alight at Jongno 5-ga Station and use exit 7 or 8.",Positive
135,"At first, I walked around the fabric section of this market and then ended up in the food portion. I am a big foodie and instantly my eyes widened! Vendor after vendor, of seafood, fried food, vegetables, street food, etc.. I was in heaven. The stalls were pretty repetitive, but there is still a huge selection. I tried a few fried items first, delicious. After browsing the stalls I sat at one and ate a bowl of fresh Bibimbap. The bowl was filling and very affordable. The market itself was crowded obviously in the evenings, but there is plenty of room to look, sit, and eat! I recommend coming here for lunch or dinner at least once during a stay just to sample a variety of food items.",Positive
136,"This gwangjang market was inly 8minutes walk from novotel ambassador seoul dongdaemun , and offer so many variant of korean food , love it !!! And the price is even cheaper and open until midnight.  Beside food, also selling so many things, something for house and all, great to explore korea in this way",Positive

Pa-jeon, Nok-du-jeon, bin-dae-ddeok, ma-yak-gim-bap, etc.  Oh, and inner side of the market offers many stores that offer beautiful traditional korean clothes for you to wear at very billiger price! Try them!",Positive
140,"Nice to walk around the market place for city folks, but food wise nothing fantastic. Most stores sell almost the same food under the same section.",Positive
141,This is a bustling market with may stall selling traditional South Korean dishes. It was a good experience. I realized though that the price per order are no cheaper than eating on the other restaurants that we've dined in.,Neutral
142,"This enormous market is an absolute must visit when you’re in Seoul. The market sells goods and foods and this review will focus on the foods. First, it would be impossible to do this market justice by any single review. One could spend a month here and still not discover all that it offers. I was interested in trying Korean beef tatare. I found my way to “raw beef alley” and picked a place. The beef here is delivered each morning and is of the highest quality and freshness. I tried my dish with a chopped live baby octopus on top. Most westerners may balk at the dish when they see the chopped tentacles moving about on top of a mound of bright red raw beef. Break the egg yolk on top and dig in! I guarantee it will be one of the most delicious dishes you have ever tasted. If you eat sushi and like your steak rare, then it’s not much of a step to eat Korean beef tartare and live baby octopus.",Positive
143,"We were spoiled for choices for the many food stores. Wet market to buy condiments and kimchi. Also there are many knick knacks and snacks to bring home. If you are interested in hanboks, there are many shops that sell them.",Positive
144,"The market is huge - there are sections selling clothing, textile, bedding, kitchenware; but most people congregate at the food stalls. Be sure to eat kimbap, tteokbokki, mandu and all the other Korean delights. I loved the bibimbap and bindaetteok or the mung bean pancake a lot. The shops also sell souvenirs like roasted laver, honey butter almonds - all at a cheaper price than bigger retail outlets. It's a wonderful place to visit indeed!",Positive
145,If you don’t like being around a ton of busy people don’t go! It was fun and we saw so much! Plenty to eat and walking. It’s a must do.,Positive
146,"We came to Gwangjang Market for lunch & loved it so much that we came back for breakfast on our last day in Seoul. We had the gimbap and bindae-tteok/mungbean pancake that the market are famous for. Both were great, we especially loved the mungbean pancake, with it's crisp golden outside & soft inside. We also had kalguksu/knifecut noodle soup with mandu/dumplings. It was fantastic! Would recommend Gwangjang Market to anyone who visits Seoul.",Positive
147,Eat eat eat! All kind of banchan ( Korean side dishes) ! First time trying out raw marinaded crabs. The taste is very flavourful! Must eat with rice !,Neutral
148,"We went there to experience different kinds of Korean street food. The place did not disappoint! Upon entering the market there are already few food stalls inviting you to buy their food but we kept patient and strolled more. Then we saw these lines of food stalls in the middle of the market offering different kinds such as dumplings, noodles, pancakes, chicken feet, rice cakes, and a lot more! We weren't able to try them all but our tummies were really satisfied. We will surely visit this again when we go back to Korea!",Positive
149,"Authentic traditional market. Many local food to try on. Reasonable price. You can get many other things here beside local food. Clothes, daily groceries, hanbok, etc. Highly recommended.",Positive
150,We had a nice cheap soup noodle dish with dumplings here. Very lively and busy. A lot of the stalls serve the same thing. Worth a visit!,Positive

152,"The market is very clean and easy to Find. The specialty is textiles, clothes and street Food specially mungo cakes and bibimbap. There Are a lot OF cheap winter jackets and bed warmers with rows OF stores selling different kinds OF textiles. But The highlight is The fresh lay cooked mungo cakes, bibimbap and to die fish soup. There are also live octopus sashimi but we didnot try IT.",Positive
153,"A market where locals shop is a must-visit on my list everywhere I go. Although I am not sure I think I got a feel of that at Gwangjiang ( or Kwangjang) Traditional Market. You can find anything you can think of, from food to household items. A section of the market is dedicated to street food capably managed uniformly by older ladies who do not shy from fighting for your business. 3 items are ubiquitous— Korean sausage made of pork blood and sticky rice, japche stir fried yam noodles and vegetables, and rice cakes. A kiosks sell nothing but fried mung bean cakes. I cannot say they are the tastiest food I’ve had but try them all, if only for the right to brag you have done it! Then walk it off along the very pleasant Cheonggyecheon Stream nearby.",Positive
154,"If you like Korean street food, this is the place to be. There are dozens of food stalls serving yummy Korean dishes like noodles, dumplings, bibimbab, raw squid, hundred types of kimchi, etc. It's fun to walk around and try different food. Souvenirs sold here are also cheaper. Behind the market is Cheonggyecheon stream where you can take a nice walk to burn all the calories from those delicious food.",Positive
155,"Nice atmosphere and lots of things to see and eat, but sadly smells like 🐟which can be offputing overall it was good",Positive
156,"After visiting Insadong, my friend and I went to Gwanjang Market. It has many things to offer but what I like the best is the variety of 🥘 🐙 🐠 🐟 🌶 to try. I enjoyed trying different street foods especially the octopus marinated in chili 🌶 (I forgot the name) I will go back to enjoy their food again. It was late when I saw the bedsheets and different comforters. I think the prices of cloth and bedsheets are cheaper there than in other markets I visited. I need to bring larger suitcases next time so that I can buy things I want in that market.",Positive
157,"As you can imagine, at the food street this is extremely touristy; however it’s a great one pit stop to try all the different kind of snacks!  What we loved about it was it’s variety, though you can find almost the same food at each stand... it’s a nice atmosphere to soak in!  We had the braised pork intestines, tteokbooki (not sure if I’m spelling this right), japchae! Also bought a bag of mandarin oranges from JeJU!  We came around 1pm and it was bustling! Easy to get here on foot from the subway!",Positive
158,I enjoy the crowd but the food I ate was pretty so-so. I had Korean pancake and it was too oily for me. Even so I would like to give it a try again with other stall. The sidedish stall looks yum. The market was clean but some vendor might be a bit aggressive.,Positive
159,"Lots of vendors selling fabrics, clothes and food. Pretty intense and overwhelming inside. Food stalls were all the same. Sellers were very pushy. If you stop to look, they automatically try to hand you a menu and make you sit. We had to keep on walking so that we wouldn’t feel pressured to buy, which didn’t allow us to focus much. Once we decided to stop at one of the stalls and try out the pancakes, they brought out 2 when we only wanted one so we ended up having to pay for both. Felt a little tricked because we’re foreigners. Wanted to look at fabrics, but every time we would stop to check them out, we would get harassed by the sellers and when we’d decide not to buy, they’d get upset and start becoming unfriendly. It got frustrating a bit. We did checked out one souvenir shop where the seller was a very nice sweet older man. Overall, it was an interesting place to see. I would still recommend it.",Negative
160,We having a dinner here. There are some food is famous at the market and must try. You may buy some Korean snack there as it really cheap compare to other market.,Neutral
161,Good way to see Korean local culture. Lots of opportunity to eat local food and shop for Staples. You can find some shopping for tourists but basically a place to immerse in a culture. Worth a few hours of your time,Positive
162,"This market has become a trap for both locals and tourists. It used to be a place to get some mouthwatering street food, but after it got popular, they no longer accept credit card and became super expensive. Not to mention unhygienic and rude atmosphere. You might want to try out just a little food there, but do not plan to have a whole meal because that will cost more than fine restaurants in the city. The quality has been falling for the past few years. Even for Koreans, this place is tough not to get ripped-off. (Oh, and the government actually protects shop owners from doing those kind of things because they consider them as being ""vulnerable"" compared to corporate-owned restaurants. Accordingly, there will never be an improvement)",Positive
163,"The Mung Bean Pancake is a Must Try. The Japchae (glass noodle), the pig's trotter and some other dishes are all over the food alley. Those stalls selling the Korean snacks are willing to go on bargains, esp. if a relatively huge amount of stuffs are bought. A friendly couple of this store even offered free yoghurt drinks to my kids and were happy to reduce prices with small free packs of snacks like seaweed in the bag",Positive
164,"For a foodie like me, this place was like a foreign haven. It has all sorts of Korean food. Absolutely worth the extra pounds I gained!",Positive
165,This is a fabulous place to come and try some great Korean food. Snack your way around the market and leave stuffed and satisfied.,Positive
166,"Seriously, I really though Seoul is all about hiphop, high end, classy stuff, but after my week long stay in Seoul, i realized that Seoul is really rather people city than the classy nature I thought previously.  Gwangjang market is truly a gem of what like really living in Seoul like, and how they enjoy so much in here as the food is good, cheap and come in huge variety.  Please do come here early to start enjoying, as the crowd keep coming in endlessly...  Have fun, its worth visiting and is FREE to do so .. :D",Positive
167,"Spent a couple of hours wondering around with my family, stopping at various stalls to try the foods. Soups, dumplings, omelettes, noodles, fruit juices - and a variety of sometimes recognisable meat products. We saw most of it cooked before our very eyes. It was so intense and jam packed with new sights and smells. Absolutely worth a visit.",Positive
168,"Went alone one afternoon, had Kimchi Dumplings and a sweet Cold Noodle dish with ice cubes. I’ve travelled across different parts of the world and found Korean food to be quite sweet, as well as pungent. It was cool to sit in the market and l got talking to a girl from Taiwan.  Only downside is that a lot of the stalls are very similar, but still a cool place.",Positive
169,Gwangjang Market is a great way to experience an abundance of Korean dishes from sweet to savoury. There are so many stalls set up in the middle with some normal and weird food on display. Walk around the different areas to see the clothing and textiles too!,Positive
170,"Huge market for foodstuffs, clothing and FOOD! Popularized by Runningman, celebrity chefs, and more, Gwangjang market gives a glimpse into what Korean food culture is like.  Simply put... so much food! Bring enough cash! ...skip the dumplings",Positive
171,It’s definitely a place that has abundance of food. Come in the morning and try the variety out. There’s a millet cake with red bean that’s really famous but personally I don’t think it’s the best. There’s a lot of textiles as well as plants. A lot of fabrics to make coats and shirts and many shops sells souvenirs and Hanbok (Korean traditional dresses). There’s salted fishes as well as raw octopus for consumption.,Positive
172,"Lots of food and wholesale stuff to buy. I am unsure if the prices are any cheaper but its a great experience. We bought some local snacks from the snacks stores. The hanboks there are really pretty, even for kids too. Worth the trip if you have something to buy.",Positive
173,"Coming from the US to Korea has shown us many things we never knew existed, and many things done differently than we ever considered. Gwangjang is one of those. It is densely packed maze of little tiny shops and street vendors that is wonderful to explore. The food vendors offer a wide variety of novel foods, prepared right in front of you. The traditional clothing stores are dangerous to those of us with little will power and a love of cultural garb.",Positive
174,"You got to visit this market if you are in Seoul. It shows you what things Koreans buy for their kitchens. From various type of chilis, veggies to ginseng and silk cocoon. But the best part is the food vendors. Huge huge huge numbers of them. Good food but inexpensive price: best.",Positive
175,"One of the Korean traditional market where you can see and taste the local foods, experience the local shopping, to see the local foods, vegetable, fruits, Korean traditional side dishes, seafood, Korean Hanbok, etc.  You may go to the Majeongyo underground shopping centre, they sold handmade traditional souvenirs and it is a little bit cheaper from the one in the market.",Neutral
176,"I went there only for the the street food and haven’t been disappointed. I had chicken feet, tteokbokki, maiak kimbab and kimchi pancakes. I loved every single bit of everything I ate. Attention though because they have 2 separate menus for locals and foreigners and if you don’t speak or read korean at all you might pay 2000 or 3000 won more than locals for the same food.",Positive
177,It is very interesting Korean traditional market where you can taste local street food. There are also a restaurants in the market where you can sit down and have a little more formal meal. The pity is that nearly all the food vendors are selling exactly the same traditional food. It would be nice to add some variety of modernized Korean food like what you can find in the other part of the city.,Positive
178,"Gwangjang market is good for ladies shopping. as variety of clothes specially ladies wear you can buy from there at reasonable price compared to other malls in Seoul. There are food stalls, one can enjoy Music which is playing on streets. People are enjoying there all the time. Good people. Good Place.",Positive
179,"Loved this place. Sights sounds and smells really make you come alive. The food was the main attraction for ourselves and this is in the centre of the market. Make time however, to take in the fish, spice, kimchi and textile stores on route. There is a massive choice of places to eat, with each type of speciallity seeming to have the same location with different stall traders servicing the same option in each area. Prices are clearly shown and standard across the piece. Not as cheap as I expected but still much better than western prices. We chose to have just one type of dish (portion ) at each stall so we could try as many things as we could before getting full. Mung bean pancakes were our fav!4000 a portion. Bibimbap 5000 was really good. Fish cakes in a soup were nice at 3000. Sundae a blood sausage filled with spiced sweet rice were fantastic, they are served with cooked liver which reminded me of my child hood 6000. Bottled water is provided free - one central bottle from which you fill your own cup. Alternatively look for stores on the side selling Cass beer in small cans for 2000. Kimchi as usual was served complmentary. Didnt try any fish stuff as off to Busan later. Deffo a great place to try most of Koreas fantastic food in a great atmosphere.",Positive
180,"Big food market, crowded with a confusion of sights, sounds and smells. I was wandering from my hotel looking for somewhere to eat on a sunday evening when many surrounding restaurants were closed and suddenly came across this market with an over-abundance of choice of street food. Common format was to have a cooking stall at the front onto the street with some tables in a room behind. Sitting at the tables was a bit less frenetic. Not much english spoken, but got by fine with 'point and smile' as menus have pictures and an english title for each dish. A meal (a sort of half pancake, half omelette with green beans and seafood) and a beer was 16,000 Won. On a sunday evening I seemed to be the only tourist among thousands of people, many buying a take-away in metal foil containers. Going to the market for a desert of deep fried sweet pastry with a dipping cup of sugar also seemed very popular.",Positive
181,"Great place to try all the different Korean street food, not for the people on diets. Also lots of good Korean products",Positive
182,This is my favourite market on earth. A lot of delicious street food all over the market. It’s the true part of daily life in the city. I highly suggest visiting the market for a true local experience.,Positive
183,"Gwangjang is na interesting place to visit. Big, chaotic, full of people, varied business. We had a great sushi in one of the small booths. Definitely worth a visit.",Positive
184,The market is very big full of street food and small restaurant. Visiting in the afternoon is very hot in summer. Visiting at night to taste the street food will be much more pleasant.,Positive
185,"Love this market! Apparently, this market is divided into sections, there is bibimbap section, hanbok section, etc. Market is clean and nice. If you like traditional market you must visit this place. They sell a lot of things, varieties of fermented goods (their fermented octopus kimchi is to die for), beautiful hanboks, korean cookware (that ramyeon pot you always see in k-dramas, stone pot for bibimbap,etc), food stalls (dumpling, pumpkin porrridge, mung bean pancakes, barley rice bibimbap, etc) and many more.",Positive
186,"Spent an entire morning at the market...you can get fresh produce, freshly blended juices, freshly made ice-coffee, ice cream, the mung bean pancake and for us Malaysian women, go crazy for all the pre-cut various different cloths available at USD10 each. There is Korean Silk, cotton, washable silk, linen, etc...Bed-linen of various sizes and shapes and styles and makes, Oh Man...decisions, decisions.",Neutral
187,"Large local market provide food, gifts and Korean dress. Best place to see local things if you first visit Seoul.",Positive
188,"Very nice visit; however, I wish I knew how to tell the street food ladies to only give a half portion or small portion. Many were confused when we were just sampling different foods and not finishing. We wanted to leave room for the next stop.",Positive
189,"Gwangjang Market Is known to be one of the first permanent markets in Korea and is a popular tourist destination. The market is famous for its textiles; there are hundreds of stores that sell silk, satin, and linens. The stores here usually supply fabrics to the different market like in Namdaenum, Dongdaemun, and department stores. Aside from the fabrics, this place is also known for their food. There are many food carts in the middle aisles selling different local dishes like bibimbap, dumplings, mung pancakes, live octopus, rice cake, blood sausage and a lot more.",Positive
190,"This is probably the biggest and best food market according to the media, went there 1st thing in the morning, very disappointed. Lots of stalls but majority are the same food. Tried to cover each stall, unfortunately I couldn’t eat that much. Went there in winter, and the best thing was the seats were heated! Yes they were heated, how good was that for winter and an open space! But the food ... pretty average, nothing special. I was actually quite disappointed after my trip to Korea overall. I tried all the famous food I saw on the Korean drama, none of them were good. I was very keen on Korean food before, loved everything from the Korean restaurants here in Australia, but since I been there and tried it? I would say the Korean food which’s not from actual Korea is lot better. Korea is quite expensive compare to other Asian countries. Was there for half month and traveled from Seoul all the way down south to Jeju island, the only thing I felt good was the green tea waffle from Jeju island . So if u ever go on food trip, go to China, best food ever on the planet",Positive
191,"Visited Gwangjang 2 years ago and really liked it and went back this year. It didn't seem as impressive as before and the stalls were quite repetitive. We had some bibimbap at a stall then had some japchae - I ordered one portion and was served two miserable overpriced portions by the corner stall. Then we had mung bean pancakes. Interesting array of Korean street food, some of which are less common like the seafood dishes. It's a tourist trap so beware of upselling and some badgering.",Negative
192,"It's a big market (or really collection of markets as there are other markets in the area) and there are some really great bargains to be found.  There are tons of food stalls, but sadly they seem to all have mostly the same items and the ones I tried were ok, nothing more.",Positive
193,"We heard great things about the market, went in the afternoon on a weekday. Lots of offer with loads of stalls but it’s all the same. Fish, vegetables and juices, or bedding. Depends what you like but I have been to much, much better markets unfortunately this one just wasn’t worth the train ride for us. If you like to take photos it’s a good spot I guess.",Positive
194,"Having seen the Gwangjang Market written up many places as somewhere you had to visit in Seoul, my family went for dinner. We were very disappointed as it was much more intimidating than expected. We had already been to many places to eat in Seoul and to various markets. Gwangjang was among the most frenetic, crowded and dirty of them. We were not inspired to eat there. Instead, we were more comfortable with the street food in Myeongdong. I'm sure this is an instance of a difference in Western and Asian sensibilities, but I feel that Western tourists should be made aware that Gwangjang is not like anything you would be used to in the West.",Negative
195,Easily to access via metro. Love the food here such as mungbean pancakes and other. Is full with tourist and foodssssssssss.,Positive
196,Must visit this local Korean Market with varieties food and daily items can be found in this market. You can experiences changing stall by stall tasting different local delicious as most stall have limited seating area.,Negative
197,"A variety of Korean street food sold there - mandu, bibimbup, tokpokki, pancakes, noodles etc. Price is not really cheap though. Other sections sell textiles, snacks, souvenirs,hanbok etc. Interesting place to visit.",Positive

199,This is a great place to buy gifts for family and friends as well as enjoy delicious and traditional street foods in Korea. :),Positive
200,"Most markets in Seoul offer the same stalls and after being to a few, it can be tiresome... except for Gwangjang Market! The food is real and local! The Mung Bean Pancake here rules its all! The Live Octopus is acquired taste but kids liked it!",Positive
201,"The market has different sections selling different items so we went only to the food street to try their local delights. Had the mungbean pancake, famous donuts and also live octopus! Alot of their locals eat there, tourists were browsing more. Great local experience! Donuts were freshly made, located at the far end of the street. This stall is made famous as it has appeared on TV prog thrice! Be prepared to queue, but queue moves pretty fast. Go there n try for the local food experience and korean food culture! I went with a local guide so i did not have problems ordering food. But I realised that the hawkers are really friendly and welcoming unlike some local markets in other countries when you don’t speak their language. If you have time, do visit this food street!",Positive
202,"Lots of stalls here selling hanbok, hanbok fabric and other stuff.  Came here for the food. Food selection was varied and also very affordable! We sat at an ahjumma's stall and ate small kimbap, tteokbokki and jokbal. All were delicious! We loved the jokbal :) This ahjumma also serves live baby octopus and other food.  At this market we also got to eat sundae, as well as fish cakes.  We left with our tummies full! Definitely coming back here on my next visit.",Positive
203,"A market serving Korean cuisine, selling Korean titbits and traditional costume. Came here to really enjoy the authentic Korean food. Don’t expect clean and nice restaurant. If you expect that type of standard then this is not a place for you. It’s really the sit at the streetside-hawker style of eating. There are plenty of tit bits to buy, ranging from ginseng sweets / dried seaweed to chocolates. Also ginseng and other products for making Korean soup. There is a segment with traditional Korean costumes and selling Korean textile and pillows/cushion. The market is structured with a few streets branching out from the Center. Each streets covers their on specialty too. This is also the place I had my fresh live octopus! It was yummy and fresh. Tried the raw beef too! There are also plenty of stalls selling noodles etc. You can also bargain at the titbits stall and costumes stall.",Positive
204,Nice market with foods to choose from and textile and hanbok to choose from. There were many stalls that are selling same kind of foods around there.  Lovely place with good food and some snacks or clothes to shop around.,Positive
205,We did not have enough time to enjoy the sights and tastes of this local market. There was a wide variety of food on sale and the sight of the old ladies selling their wares was insightful about what an active lifestyle would do to add years to life. Definitely worth a visit.,Positive
206,"We came mainly for the raw beef and octopus. There are many small restaurants selling the same thing. We picked one with a good review and it is actually a Michelin Star restaurant, how surprising! The food tasted so good and fresh.  There are also booths selling pancakes, fish cakes, tteokbokki, kimbap and other snacks.",Positive
207,"Despite being a market, it was clean and feels very comfortable.  Great place to have a simple meal. Would recommend the greenbean pancake, gimbap and bibimbap there! Stalls there were very friendly.  Went around 4pm on Friday and there wasnt a lot of people. Great time to eat and buy souvenirs & tidbit/snacks.",Positive
208,"For a break for a lunch or just for discover the Seoul street food I just ended up here randomly ! It s not a big market but the food alleys are really interesting, the weird things like octopus, the smells of the potato bread , etc etc Colorful, full of live , smells , spices Good place",Positive
209,"I felt that this market gave a true Korean experience. There are plenty of stalls (all serving slightly the same meals - bibimbap, gimbap, rice cakes, fish, etc) and you just take a seat and they serve you! Easy as that. It's a great place to meet locals, expats, people watch, and drink. It is complete chaos and super super busy but it is a really cool environment. I came here two nights in a row and will 100% be back. Truly authentic.",Positive
210,"visited this place around 5 pm and some of the textile shop already closed and replace with food street. However, not very much diversities - we only found dumplings, fried chinese style egg with pork and vegetables.....plenty of stall selling the same food",Negative
211,"Traditional or modernized? It's a mixture of both as there are stalls that remain tradition selling traditional stuff while some furnished their shop with air-conditioner selling Hanboks. They are divided into sections just like other markets in Seoul that makes it very clear which section you are in. There is a section selling food, which, normally patronized by tourists more than locals. The food stalls there selling identical food stuff so tourists can just choose any stalls to eat them. There are also shops surrounding the food stalls selling food items too, perhaps slightly more expensive as they dun seem to be crowded unlike the stalls outside. You can get most the stuff you need from this market, from raw food to cooked side dishes, cloths, mattresses, blankets, Hanboks to cooking wares.",Positive
212,"We took the Seoul Metro to Jongno 5-ga Station. From there it's about a 5min walk to Gwangjang Market. The market has clothes and food merchants - we arrived just before lunchtime which enabled us to walk/explore without any issues. Once lunch begins, you will see workers from nearby offices/businesses flock into the market and sit at the various food stalls - usually a shared bench/table which surrounds the vendor stall. There's all manner of Korean food which caters to all different palates. The market also has a large number of Hanbok clothing stores which line the alleyways as well as stores which provide jewelry for the Korean weddings. There's also many men's suit and clothing shops where you can buy suit material or ready-made shirts if you desire. As you explore the many areas of the market, there's even live seafood shops which have produce available for purchase, as well as traditional Korean snacks. We had lunch at one of the many vendors and tried the bibim naemgyeon cold noodle dish and my wife had a noodle soup that had wide rolled noodles (made in front of your whilst you wait). If you love exploring, visit Gwangjang. It's also about a 15min walk to Dongdaemun area. Highly recommend visiting this market.",Positive
213,"Eating from the stalls is a must. The food is good but the whole experience is what I like, it reminds you of where you are as it is very ‘Korean’. I had lived in Korea for 3 years and I really enjoyed being in the bustle of the market.",Positive
214,I like this place but never thought I like it enough to write a review until my most recent visit. I found myself naturally drawn to this place. I came to realization that you can find comfort in the food here. Some bread and butter shops may seem unexciting but it tells of the locals' life. Very interesting food options and excellent for the mini explorer in you.,Positive
215,Our guide said most of the goods here were lower end. Liked seeing the fresh produce and fish for sale. I was extremely surprised to see English translations of the offerings of the street food at many stalls.,Positive
216,"Gwangjang market located a stone throw away from Jongno 5-ga exit 1, is rather overrated. When I visited, it was packed and although there were many stores, they mostly served similar things. Price wise, I would say it's rather reasonable. My friend and I ended up buying our food and walking over to Cheonggyecheon Stream to enjoy our food away from the crowd.",Positive
217,"Usual food they sell here are seafood pancakes, kimbaps and noodles. Cheaper prices but limited variety of food. There are more food choices outside the market for a dollar or two more.",Negative
218,"Our guide mentioned that if we say Gwangjang Market, he gets hungry just by remembering how good their Korean pancakes there. So we got curious and went to see the place. We took the bus and it's very convenient because it stops right in front of the market. We ate their Korean pancakes (pajeon) of course. There's a lot variety, vegetarian, or with meat or seafood. The place sells a lot of other things, food stuffs. It's a great place for people who loves to eat!",Positive
219,"The market is covered with shops and stalls of food, souvenirs, utensils, cloth, handmade products. They basically sells same and similar stuffs. You can large range of street food here though. From mung bean pancake to porridge to kimbap to bibimbap to mandu to live seafood to raw beef and etc. The market is very convenient too, it is right in front of a metro exit.",Neutral
220,No very impressed at all... same kind of food in every stole ... was interesting to came there... but I wouldn’t came again and I wouldn’t eat in here again .... not worth it,Positive
221,"This place was recommended to me, but I thought it was just okay. If you're in the area, I would check it out, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it. There are a lot of markets in Seoul, and this one didn't seem special to me.",Neutral
222,"I always enjoy visiting traditional markets wherever I visit. Gwangjang market is one such place definitely worth visiting in Seoul if one wants to have a true local experience different from upscale markets Seoul has to offer. Great place for those who want to try Korean street food delicacies. Good place to pick up few souvenirs too … we found a good shop where we picked up colourful silk bojagis - Korean wrapping cloth, which make a cool gift. There are several shops selling textile and we bought some Korean silk cloth for dress. Rest of the time was spent exploring all the local food and vegetables on sale all around! Very nice atmosphere to enjoy.",Positive
223,It is a traditional market where you can find all kind of local products where the local would go. There is even a eatery place where you choose and eat.,Neutral
224,"Gwangjang Market is the place where you can find any Korean traditional food with reasonable price. Open till late around 9pm. Have visited it twice during winter, the hot topokki and japchae, plus soup for the drink, just warmed my body as I needed. One of a popular places to visit in Seoul, no wonder the market was quite dense by tourists during lunch.",Positive
225,"Lots of great street food and friendly vendors. It's a great market also for hanboks, Korean bedding, and housewares. And there are some souvenir shops at the ends as well. Definitely itinerary-worthy.",Positive
226,"I went here suuuuper hungry and I was not disappointed with the food! Tried mayak kimbap, sundae, odeng etc etc and yukhoe (raw beef) which was really goood! I don't even eat raw food, but when I had this... It was just good and did not taste raw at all! They also have fruits and other stuff, but the highlight is definitely the food the serve. The price is very reasonable and the place is very easy to locate.",Positive
227,"Huge market, many different things to try. Prepared right in front of you, it's difficult to choose at which store you want to sit down to eat... so I've been here a couple of times already haha.",Positive
228,"The market visit was an interesting one as sellers where anxious to have you sit down and eat the food that they were cooking. Local people ignored us tourists and enjoyed their meal. Some of the local dishes were not for the faint of heart. Our guide took us through a factory where costume jewelry was being made for retailers through out the world. There were several hundred little shops with one tow two people working. Nothing was for sale to the general public, It was amazing to see how nimble the workers could put things together and how quickly they could do it. A nice experience.",Positive
229,"Lots of food stalls in the area. However, there are sections of various but similar food. For example, one area was for the korean pancakes, another for seafood, and another for pork feet and blood sausgae, etc... In addition, there were shops for traditional wear and Korean snacks. You can use the Seoul City Tour hop on and off service to get here or arrive via other modes of transport.",Neutral

231,"This is one of the oldest traditional markets in Seoul and is considered one of Korea’s largest traditional (and most beautiful) markets. I was recommended by the hotel’s Concierge to visit Gwangjang market if I am interested in authentic, local street food and window shopping for silk items and kitchenware (including utensils and cookware). At first sight, the market will look a mess but as you enter the maze of inviting stores.  The food section of the market was further north with some food stalls entertaining snaking lines of up to 10 patience customers. I found myself a small seating spot and had the following for breakfast: Topokki (Korean Spicy Rice Cake) Japchae (Korean Glass Noodle Stir Fry) Janchi Guksu (Korean Warm Noodle Soup)  This is definitely a place I would live to re-visit if I was in Seoul again. Smelling, hearing, seeing, tasting and just being there in the middle of Gwangjang Market; doesn't get any better than that.",Positive
232,All the stalls seemed to be selling the same type of street food. Not much of a variety. Left the place after trying out some of the food and purchased some kimchi.,Neutral
233,"We had an amazing experience at the Kwang Jang street market. They have authentic Korean street food, a plenty of different small shops to explore and the atmosphere was great.",Positive
234,I really had a good time at Gwangjang Market. The food that they offered here was scrumptious. I really do enjoyed having a Hotteok and a Raw Octopus which is we eat it alive. The souvenir here was a bit cheap compared to Myeongdong and has various choices. What I can suggested if you guys go to this place please empty your stomach before you go here and try all the food in this place. It’s worth it.,Positive
235,"It's a traditional market with a mix of prepare food stalls and shops with areas to buy raw ingredients. A must see for anyone coming to Seoul wanting to taste of traditional Korean food. The shop and stall owners can be a bit too friendly trying to get you to eat there, but its all part of the charm. It is jam packed at night so if you want to visit, I recommend going for lunch and sampling food as you walk through. There is some variety in types of food you see but generally encompasses: kimbap(Korean seaweed rice rolls), Tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), Jeon (battered pancakes with fish, veggies and meats). Food is cheap and non pretentious. Bring an empty stomach and an open mind to try a few new things.",Positive
236,"Lots of food vendors option for you, taste is pretty much the same around here (it taste good) we didn't choose to sit at those vendors outside as there are too many people walking around and it bang our back. So we chose one of the restaurant with heater which we can rest and get warm with good food. They also have live octopus (Sanakji) at the Market, there is a shop located at the beginning of the street which i will not suggest you to go (sorry i forgotten the name, we went for the Sanakji randomly). Service is bad, there is no table for us and they ask us to sit outside with no proper table to eat, the octopus was stated 6000 won and they say they have, once we sat down they say that they don't have it. We felt cheated.",Negative
237,"This is just one of those MUST DO items. A great selection of local foods prepared right in front of you. There are at least 100 vendors here with a great array of food, items and treats.",Positive

240,"This market is mainly fabric, linens, Korean Hanbok outifts and housewares. The food vendors are in the center of the market. There is row of all Bibimbap with heaping bowls of vegetables. Then there are rows or vendors serving chicken feet, rice cake, kimbap and soup. The prices were reasonable and the food was hot. We tried just about everything. You could probably find just about any fabric here, even for suits. Bring cash for the food.",Neutral
241,"This market offers both foods and garments, you'll realize most of the food vendors here offer almost the same food, and when you're here there's a few food you must try here, that is the beef tartare and live octopus cuts.  for beef tartare, go to that restaurant that slices their beef fresh, you can see from outside the window, this restaurant serve live octopus as well.",Positive
242,"Tourists would be able to find some local, delicious and cheap Korean style food here. However, the stands in the market basically all sell the same thing and it's lack of variation.",Positive
243,A market for food and fabric incredible large area be ready to walk should you arrive by bus!  The food choices are huge good quality but like often before street food does not mean cheap in Seoul! We had some of their famous mung bean pancake' was ok but tasted better before' plus rice cake on slice sauce' same comment for that dish' the area was busy and the staff was a little short on temper at the first location!  We moved on to sample the blood sausage and a spicy stew of offal meat both brilliant' one dines on small wooden benches out of plastic cups' we stopped with this the dumpling and noodle soup will have to wait until we return,Positive
244,"Great place for Korean local foods. Lots of stalls all selling similar food items. Aside from that, not much is worth visiting and I believe most tourists come here just for the food, as we didn't see people checking out the stores that're lined around the whole market.",Positive
245,"This is a wholesale market. You can buy really beitiful traditional bedding, fabric, Hanboks that are the traditional Korean Dresses. The color are incredible and beutiful. You can savor cheap street food, loke gimbap, jokbal,bindaetteok and more.",Neutral
246,"I asked the hotel for a market to see and take photos and they recommended Gwangjang market. The market has food shots - seafood, beef, pickles etc. But the best part is a the center it has many food stands where you can get various Korean dishes - spicy rice cake, fish cakes, pajun pancakes etc. It was super cold when I was there but the benches are heated. It is all open air. I had a good time there.",Positive

248,Nice food and souvenir shops. The souvenir shop owner is very nice to let us try everything before we buy. The price is fair. The most popular snacks is the green bean pancake and rice roll. Worth to try. 手信店可以試吃後才買，價格便宜。值得一試的小吃有炸綠豆餅和麻藥飯卷。,Positive

251,"It was so cool place. I've been there for a while. I love there foods and vibes : ) I think there is perfect place to feel the traditional market of Korea. I've visit Gwanghwamoon, insadong and Gwangjang market. those Foods are pretty cheap and delicious. Acually I've been visited few years ago in Summer. It was so hot ....... so it would be better to visit in Winter. you can also buy so many kinds of Souvenir in there. Have fun and enjoy that place",Positive

Be sure to sit on their stalls and point the menu that you want to eat. Otherwise they will give you a lot of foods, including the things that you don't order. To enter the food's section, you can take exit 8 from Jongno 5-ga station.",Positive

255,"There were so many stalls to choose from, but honestly they all look about the same. We choose 2 stall that had some locals sitting down, and ordered quite a few dishes including blood sausage, narcotic gimbaps, japchae, bibimbip, and mandu.  Everything was delicious except for the japchae (which was flavorless). Be sure to double-confirm what you order with the ladies manning the stall though, as we were half-forced to eat something we didn't order in the first place (apparently she asked us in Korean, and we had unknowingly agreed to).  If you are a foodie visiting Seoul, Gwangjang Market is a must-visit!",Positive

There are so many souvenir shops. There are also plenty of cheap textile shops but quailty seemed poor to me. If you want to go where locals go, this is your place",Positive
258,"Took the subway to this place. We enjoyed our visit here so much. We ate with the locals, we ordered Bibimbap rice , korean ramen and mandu and ate it in a crowded food stall where you sit side by side on a long bench. It was fun. We bought from every vendor we saw like the jap chae, mung bean cakes, gimbap, strawberries and rice juice. My daughter fancied the Korean made comforter and we ended up buying one. The korean ginseng is cheaper here so I bought some as well. If you are determined to buy yourself a hanbok better buy it here. They have different designs and sizes. Surprisingly, this market smells good and is not filthy for a fact that fresh and cooked food is sold at every corner. Our tummies and our shopping bags were full on our way home.",Positive
259,"Long for eating from food stalls but it was way too cold to eat in the market. It is not a covered market and it was under minus 10 degrees.

A lot of local food by korean aunties, that are super nice. Many stalls actually sell the same stuff, but you can just try randomly. Not necessarily the stall with more people is the best! You can just walk and wander around while you eat different food!",Positive
263,Most of the stalls were closed when we went on a Sunday morning around 10am. So it was rather quiet and didn’t really get to experience the real market atmosphere.  The food stalls were open so we tried their mung bean pancake. Seems that different stalls sold different kinds. Try the Gimbap too!  There were some stalls that sold kimchi that you can vacuum pack to bring back to your own country:),Neutral

266,"This is one stop I really enjoyed, the market was quite extensive with lots of stores selling Korean dresses, souvenirs, trinkets, food stuff and lots more. And a great thing happened!!!! There where English speaking tourist aids in the market to help you figure out the lay out!",Positive
267,"This is as authentic a market in Seoul as it can possibly can be. That it has become a tourist attraction with its own dedicated team of official guides is proof that this is no ordinary place despite its very ordinary setup. Plenty of stalls to get your food, drink, souvenirs, fabrics and, our favourite item, the almond nuts. The shopkeepers are a pleasant bunch, and they'll even throw you a special off-the-shelf item if you buy a lot (which we did) and they are, surprise, open to a bit of bargaining. But I suppose its because we're tourists.",Positive
268,"There are various markets around town, and you should visit several to see the differences. This one has lots of authentic food stalls and fabric stores selling hanbok fabrics. You can purchase clothing and coats here (be sure to bargain), as well as quilted slippers, bags, and vests. Worthwhile to see!",Positive
269,"Great market, we went there to grab some food (kimbap/ bindaeteok etc.) and had a great time - you basically sit in front of the little stalls and eat and go. After that, we walked around and there were many stalls selling souvenirs (seaweed/ honey butter nuts/ ginseng extract) and bought a few things. The stall owners don't really speak English/ Chinese, but communication was alright. The price of honey butter nuts here was definitely cheaper than in Myeongdong",Positive
270,"This is one of the oldest traditional market in Seoul, and best place for tourist to come here for the korean street food. Bindaetteok (mung bean pancakes), Hotteok (pancakes with brown sugar filling), Tteokbokki (stir fried rice cakes), Gimbap (rice roll), Sundae (Korean Sausage) are few “must eat” food in this traditional market which you should not miss. It’s a place for you to experience local eating culture, and it’s conveniently located Exit 8 or 9 of the Subway Jongno-5 station.",Positive
271,"It's amazing to get lost in the stalls of this market! So many food options from exotic to tame. The stalls are mostly run by ladies and most make the same thing, with a few that serve other stuff like seafood. Lots of tteokbokki, soondae, gimbap, pajeon, etc. It's a bit overwhelming to decide which stall to go to, but try to look for one with locals eating there, usually a good sign!",Positive
272,"Pretty much only came for the food. Many to choose from! I had to have the sundae, kimbap and bindaetok which were all amazing",Positive
273,"If you are looking for a traditional cultural feel, this is the market to go to! Lots of interesting food stalls n food produce. Local Korea n products too! There are quite a few food stalls selling live octopus dish! Fun place to visit n experience for all ages!",Positive
274,"I always stop by Gwangjang market whenever I'm in Korea (which is every year for the last 4 years.)  Koreans are more reserved than friendly. So don't expect smiley vendors. To some, they might come out as rude. Out of the blue, I had one old lady server who stopped by my table, grabbed and poured my 1/8 cup of sesame oil/salt and pepper on my dish--without a hi/smile/nothing. It might look rude but it's more motherly. She's just showing you how to eat it.  You can sit on any vacant seats. Order up. It's not expensive. Beware of the boneless chicken feet. It's seasoned like fire chicken/불닭. It will set your mouth on fire. This market is also famous for bindaetteok/빈대떡/mung bean pancakes--crunchy, savory, and delicious with rice wine or beer or soju. I also tried fresh octopus. They wiggle and might get stuck in your throat, so chew like a mad man. Have fun!",Positive
275,Got to this place to look for winter wear. We ended up with a big bag stuffed with winter wears all for just less then $200!,Neutral
276,"Please try not to rush through. Enjoy the sights, sounds, people, and atmosphere. Found this excellent booth with snacks to bring home. Sorry, I can't help you find it. The ahjumma was the bomb.",Positive
277,This place is for people that enjoy traditional Korean dishes in a street style dining style. My favorite is cucumber kimchee but they're are many unique dishes to explore.,Positive
278,"This place if absolutely a must see for food lovers. Enjoyed by locals and tourists, this place is always swarmed. We enjoyed kimbap, odeng, bibimbap, fresh made noodles, bindaetteok (at the center of the cross roads). Many locals were additionally queuing for hotteok, so we decided to get that too. Absolutely loved this place; research youtube for the best stands.",Positive
279,"It is a market frequented by locals and tourists, I was told. There are many food stalls to try many types of Korean foods, which is a good thing if you are travelling solo. There are also stalls selling Korean snacks and souvenir.",Positive
280,We went there during lunch time and we were surprised for a number of hawker food at there. You can try the famous live octopus here if want.,Positive
281,"This is a ""tourists"" market with tourists prices to match. You see mostly tourists eating at the many food stalls ( & buying at the shops).  Food prices here in particular are indeed Expensive & taste not that great - although it is supposedly to be a local market. And the environment & stalls areas are not very clean/ hygienic.  The food prices here are about the same or higher than those in the various nicer shopping streets cafes/ food outlets. Considering this is a humble market setting & environment , prices are without doubt expensive.  Come here for the experience if first time. We come here in every visit - not to patronise the expensive ""local market food stalls.""  But to buy delicacies like fresh Kimchi & anchovies. Freshly made Kimchis are very different from those sold prepacked in supermarts.  An elderly lady stall specialises in making this fresh Kimchi. A vacuum-pack of 1kg cost W10,000.",Positive
282,High quality korean silk. go straight to Hyun Woo Silk. bring your credit cards and cash. splurge. it's cheaper than in KL,Positive
283,"An impressive market and well worth visiting if you want to get the feel of a real Korean market, or are looking for souvenirs of any description.",Positive
284,"We took subway to Gwangjang Market. We love this traditional market cos you can sit right in front of their stall enjoying foods, beer & atmosphere. Majority of their stalls selling same foods like pancake, live fresh octopus, blood sausage, Korea traditional fishcake & a lot more. They also have restaurants there too but I still prefer stalls in the middle of the walkway.",Positive
285,Went to try all the food. Got pulled in a restaurant offering korean pancakes. Mistake letting the staff choose the stuff. Large portions and charge the earth. Think they pretend they did not understand when we ask for small portions. Eat at the stalls.,Negative
286,We went here to eat dinner. We were surprised that the area is dirty. It smells as well. We had to go around several times to find a clean restaurant. Food was not to our liking.,Positive
287,"This is another well known traditional market but the goods offered are much the same as any other market. the real draw is the food which will be quite exotic to most - I saw ""drug octopus"" and ""Dog Meat Soup"" amongst the very big emphasis on seafood.",Positive
288,"Subway to Jongno 5-ga Station (Seoul Subway Line 1), Exit 8 OR Euljiro 4-ga Station (Seoul Subway Line 2 & 5), Exit 4. There will be tourist guide personnel in red outfit patrolling the place. Stop them for directions if you need. There will always be 2 walking together; 1 speaks Mandarin and the other English. No need to worry which entrance or gate you are going in, as the one place is not really that big and it's interlinked. We visited the 2 famous stalls highly raved for their Gimbak (rice roll aka japanese maki) and Bindaettok (fried pancake). You can get bonchan or side dishes there. They help to wrap them in boxes and triple wrapped in cling wrap. Prices is quite competitive and varieties are quite standard. If you want more varieties, can get from Lotte supermarket and prices are quite close.",Negative
289,You can get all sorts of Korean local street food here. We bought snacks and souvenirs at pretty low price in this market. Recommended for those who would like to get some Korean souvenirs for their loved ones.,Positive
290,"This was by far the best part of our trip. It’s an outdoor market where you eat local food, drink local beer, and have soju.  The food vendors are lovely, friendly and fun. We tried almost everything and it was all amazing.  The market has little souvenirs you can buy around the center as well as fresh food market. The other side is purely textiles.  The food vendors are right in the center so you can’t miss them.",Positive
291,"I think this was the most traditional market but I was quite disappointed. I went on a thursday night around 6pm but 75% of it seemed to be closed down. There were vast rows of food stalls broken up into sections where they all sell the exact same thing. For me, I enjoy going to a market so I can see a vast variety of foods and try different things like at a buffet. I had one of those fried mungbean cakes and then left.",Negative
292,"There are many shops in this market, fruit stalls, vegetable stalls, clothings, bags, dried food products, traditional Korean wedding sweets, kimchi, shoes and culinary. There are also food stalls selling traditional Korean food. Most of the shop owners speak very limited English, food stalls menu has English translation on them.",Positive
293,"It's a great bustling market and in a central alley has loads of places to try street foods. I'd been meaning to try Soondae (a kind of blood sausage with glass noodles in it and served with liver) and got my chance here. It was okay if you're into black pudding, which I am. Aside from that there is every other well-known street food on offer and it's a great place to get a feel for these. There's an excellent juice stall at the southern entrance which did an excellent kale, apple, banana, and pineapple smoothie too.",Positive
294,"We came to the market primarily for street food. There are many food vendors selling similar things: mung bean pancake, rice cake, pork leg, octopus snack etc. The place was very crowded and the space was quite tight. A lot of the owner seem to be able to speak very little English and some Mandarin. We just picked the stalks with most people, assuming that they were better.  Food was ok, and on the spicy and salty side. Mung bean pancake was good. It was greasy but we shared it among 4 people, so no big deal.  We also strolled along the alleys. Most of the stores sell textile, seafood, kimchi and some traditional Korean food.  In the middle of the market (not the food area), there were 2 people wearing the red uniform with an ""i"" bag. They were the ""information center"". They can answer any questions about the area.  I don't see any public washroom there. If you see the information dual, you cna ask them.",Positive
295,"For those of you who are looking to buy cheap snacks and souvenirs, this is the place to be. The famous honey butter almonds only cost 5,000 Won here VS 7,500 Won in Myeongdong. I'm so glad I went here because I hoarded snacks and was able to save a lot of money. The food was good too!!!!",Positive
296,"This huge market gives a traditional look at Korean foods, clothing, fabrics, notions---so many items that one can spend an entire day at Gwangang or other markets in Korea. Go hungry so you can sample a variety of foods. This market had beautiful hanboks--traditional Korean dress. The children's clothes and adornments were especially charming.",Positive
297,"Other than a few overrated street food stores, the rest is just shops selling traditional Korean food, such as Kimchi and dried seafood.",Neutral
298,I'd try all the food there if I had the stomach capacity. Quiet in the morning and not crowded at all so you can enjoy a meal in peace.,Positive
299,"Interesting to see the crowd if you dare to brave it. We managed to find seats at a stall that sold seafood. Very cheap! Sine we were not into shopping, there was nothing else except to expert the place and eat something from there.",Positive
300,Seriously it was as if they were all selling the same thing. Very cramped and busy. Some of the food stunk. It was however a unique experience. But I feel there's far better food markets in Seoul.  Metro exit 7,Positive
301,Wow what a great spot. The variety of food was great. I had Bibimbap and a cold beer. Apart from food there are so many other stalls there as well.,Positive
302,many kinds of streetfood to eat. Really crowded at weekend. Should go a bit early. Really close to Cheonggyecheon Stream.,Neutral
303,"Perfect for some late night food delicates, the usual market is open just till 8 pm, but the food stalls are open much longer...",Positive
304,There's alot of food! And it is pretty delicious. Most of the stores there can speak chinese. The food portion are pretty big too. So it might be better if you go in a large group and order a variety of dishes. There's only 2 of us so we didn't manage to order alot as we are afraid that we couldn't finish it. Love the food. Would love to go there again.,Positive
305,"This place is impressive if you're up for some super traditional hawker style food set ups. Very fun to see people sitting around eating noodles and different dishes. We went when we weren't hungry so we didn't eat anything, but it was interesting to see none the less. I would recommend to check this place out for a meal, otherwise, I'd pass. The fabric was nothing to see unless you want some dress made or something.",Positive
306,"We love visiting the market - with all of the stores, food vendors, and people. One can easily get lost in the market (my companion who had been there several times just got lost after using the rest room), so best to have a plan if you get separated. If you are looking for kitchenware, hanbok, clothing, souvenirs, bedding, or just some great food, this is your place to experience some great Korean culture. We went upstairs into the Gwangjang hanbok market and ordered custom made clothing. We highly recommend this place. The smells of some of the foods might be challenging to foreigners. Just a head's up.",Positive
307,"Gwangjang Market, is a traditional street market and it one of the oldest market in Korea.Also,It popular market.Some area in this market dirty and with Awful smell .It is good place to buy korean traditional clothes Hondbok. Also,It contain food court.It tourist spot.The bad thing is Bad Smell in the market.",Negative
308,"Though this is well-known to tourists, foods here aren't that touristic. As most visitors are aware of, the highlight of this market is to eat. And tourists can easily have dishes sitting next to common old generations of local people. Having lots of menus in open spaces, foreign visitors are going to enjoy watching and won't have much difficulties to pick what to try. Prices aren't high either. In addition, there are volunteers ready to help.",Positive
309,"There is a saying if you wanted to know about one country, then go to their market. That's true. If you wanted to know more about Korean lifestyle, then go to Gwajang Market. You can enjoy all the traditional and daily food they ever have after work. Try every special dish while enjoying talking with the local.",Positive
310,"If you are travelling alone, or not alone, this is the best place to go to eat. Multiple food stands that you can just walk up to and point. Food is cheap and delicious. Excellent place to taste local food.",Positive
311,"This is a traditional Korean market that sells a whole range of items, from fabric to food to groceries. Highly recommend the Korean dumplings (mandoo), sushi rolls and especially the fried mung bean pancake! That is a must try! You can easily have enough food for your lunch/dinner there, so be sure to go there on an empty stomach! In winter, some of the stalls have heated seats, which is a nice touch.",Positive
312,"your head will spin at the sheer amount of food options in this place! it's very much alive and buzzing at night, with tourists and locals alike. the lovely ahjummas will try to rival each other to get your attention, walk around to decide which one tickle your fancy. loved the kimbap, look for a stall in a corner with Running Man poster plastered on the wall :)",Positive
313,"...and then nothing else! They're simply delicious but absolutely swimming in oil. If you're older than 20, don't try and eat one o your own. But just the plain pancake was excellent. Lovely place to wander round and look at traditional shops doing everything from metalwork, tailoring and selling fresh fish,.",Positive
314,"This is one of the more touristy spots. Lots of Korean friends and Seoul natives said they'd never been there before. There are dozens of food spots - friends told me to always go to/wait for shops that are packed, as those are often the ones with the best dishes. It's definitely easier to go with a Korean-Speaking friend (not as English-accessible as other markets and neighborhoods).",Positive
315,It is kind of dirty and always crowded. Most of foods are cheap. ($2-5) some foods are not. Don't expect clean dishes.,Negative
316,"Gwangjang market is the real local food market you can find in Seoul, Heart of capital!. The market is clean and well organize. 70% of the owner is the elderly people that can prove enough how long this market run!  Recommending : RAW Octopus, TOKBOKKI and else (many shop sells the same things)",Positive
317,"A short walk from out hotel, we wandered around here for about an hour tasting and eating many different foods. A great place for the food!",Positive
318,We entered the market from the west entrance and found ourselves in the real deep end of the local market. Got to see the shopkeepers having lunch in between piles of merchandise. Got a map of the Kwangjan (Gwanjang) Market from helpful guides for tourists stationed at the market. Proceeded to the section on the eastern side with food stalls and found a great bindaetteok eatery. Would love to return to try some more local fare the next time we are in Seoul.,Positive
319,an area full of little shops and smiling faces for buying traditional and touristy items. Plenty of eats as well.,Positive
320,"Went there to experience the local market and of course, food! There were many stalls are selling the same things and the ajummas would call out to you. Look out for the stalls with celebrity photos and visits by TV stations.  Best part was the mung bean pancake, so delicious! And sikhye which is a sweet rice punch drink!  Snacks such as honey butter almonds and seaweed are cheaper than in Lotte Mart.",Positive
321,"One of the oldest traditional markets in Seoul. Street food galore! They are famous for their mungbean pancakes & the mayak kimbap (minature sushi rolls). There is no other place I would go for mungbean pancakes. In addition they sell many In addition to food, they sell a large variety of inexpensive goods. Sometimes we found that the souvenirs are less expensive here than Namdaemun.",Negative
322,This is a great market in Seoul. You can basically enjoy a wide variety of Korean street foods in one place. It's not expensive and you get to see the most popular snacks in one place. The bindeteok is a Korean mung bean pancake which they grind on the spot and fry. The visual is amazing. Must go.,Positive
323,"Apart from being promoted as one of the traditional market you have to visit, this place is really worth your time! You can find Korean delicacies from street foods to a full course meal, Korean snacks, hanbok shops, clothes shops, medicine shops, wide ranges of Kimchi, seafoods, and Korean souvenirs at bargain price. Especially for food, you should try the market's signature foods including makjang kimbab, bindaetteok, tteokbokki, nakji, sundae, and red bean porridge. The best time to visit is in the afternoon. There are food stalls with similar foods but if you have time for some researches, you can try to find the best, the oldest and legend one among them to taste the best delicacies.",Positive
324,come here in the evenings and eat at the food stalls. It is an experience with almost no tourists and local food and next to no english speakers. I enjoyed it.,Positive
325,"Gwangjang Market is a short walk from Jongno-5 station. At night, it’s mainly the food stalls that are open. The market was really busy; many Seoulites out and about on a Saturday night. We were hoping to try the bindaetteok (mung bean pancakes), but the queues were incredibly long, so we selected a stall where we had tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), mayak kimbap (Korean-style nori rolls) and japchae (vermicelli noodles). The lady running the stall was lovely and the food was delicious.",Positive
326,"We came here later in the evening for some dinner. It wasn't very busy, as I think the shops and stuff are mostly only open during the day, but the majority of the food stalls were still going pretty strong. We walked around the whole thing (didn't take too long) before we decided on a place. Keep in mind this isn't exactly the ""grab and go"" kind of street food. You can move around and try different things if you want, but in these types of markets I prefer to just find a place to sit down and enjoy myself for a bit. The stalls are generally more like little stationary outdoor kitchens (kinda all adjacent to each other) with benches in front for seating. Unfortunately my Korean is horrible so I don't remember the names of what we had, but we sat down at a stall and had some dumpling soup and a spicy cold noodle salad which we'd had at a couple different spots around Korea. The stall owner seemed super concerned about our ability to handle the spice level of the salad, but it was similar in spice level to to a pretty spicy kimchi, so it wasn't too bad for us. If you like to eat a lot of Thai or Indian food (and therefore probably have a tolerance for a bit of spice), you should look for it and try it because it's delicious. It basically is cold rice noodles served with a spicy sauce and a bunch of veggies. The dumplings were good too, it was a nice soup to have on a chilly night when you're sitting outside eating. A group of middle-aged Koreans came and sat next to us while we were eating, and one of the guys was really friendly and shared his shochu with us.",Positive
327,Lots of stores however doesn't feel very unique. Just textiles and food stalls. Not sure if I would come back.,Negative
328,"I came to Gwangjang with a couple of friends in the height of summer (early July), and the atmosphere was everything you would expect from an Asian food market. It was sweltering with only the occasional fan; it was dense with people bustling by to get their fill of kimbap; and it was very local. The general sentiment was that you were one of only a handful of foreigners wandering the place, and the local ajummas (Korean old ladies) were constantly trying to herd you to sit down and partake in their delicious, sesame-infused offerings so that they could prove to other onlookers that they were tourist friendly.  Many of the workers and food purveyors spoke enough broken English for you to get your food and get it paid for without any problems, but it was kind of a moot point, because each little stall only had a handful of options, and they usually had their dishes set out so you could just point and ask for an order. There were little stalls that specialized in kimbap (some offer a tuna version, so just ask for ""cheum chi"" kimbap if you are tired of the garden variety), others ""japchae"" (Korean cold glass noodles with veggies), and others Korean potato pancakes with leeks (and a scrumptious onion sauce that you should ask for double portions of).  Overall, the food was good and some of the food purveyors were really friendly, but others weren't. I made the idiotic mistake of forgetting to ask a stall owner how much a handful of mandu (Korean dumplings) was before the lady plopped them into the steamer. She told me afterwards that they were $5 (the standard street price is between $1-2). Luckily, she was sulking about something and forgot to get the mandu back out of the boiling water while I was eating the rest of my meal, so I left just after I finished my other entree. She could overcharge another customer for those later.  Ladies like that are usually the exception. But, it's Seoul. It's fast paced, and people are churning out thousands of customers every Saturday night. It's not a perfect experience, it's just an experience. Sure, there are flies buzzing over some of the dishes, but this is what you're paying for. You could easily buy kimbap in a convenience store, or you could get the local atmosphere and eat your Korean pancake awkwardly while sitting over a plastic stool made for a toddler, surrounded by heaps of trash and excitable scads of locals. Just head over to Gwangjang.",Positive
329,"well, it's a subway stop and a traditional market. most venders sell similar products/food so this place won't take you a long time to tour. stop by, grab some korean street food and go. across the street, there are many restaurants that specialize in chicken soup and grilled fish, so make sure you save enough stomach space for that.",Positive
330,"This is the location where locals shop. Massive place for clothes, food, street food, restaurants, souvenirs, snacks, etc. I headed to the Yukhoe shop and loved it. This is more a local market and I could only find maps/signs in Korean. Therefore locating specific locations within the market could be tricky.",Positive
331,"Went there with my family when we were in Seoul during June 2017. The nearest Subway station is ""Jongno 5(o)-ga station"" on the Dark Blue Line 1, which is 4 stops from Seoul Station or 1 stop from Dongdaemun station. Right after one take Exit 8 of Jongno 5(o)-ga station, beside is the Gwangjang Market. There is a main local food street alley that cut across this large Gwangjang marke, selling lots of interesting local food/snacks, ranging from inexpensive & popular Mung bean pancakes, Korean Kimbap (similar to Japanese Maki roll) to mid range traditional Jokbal (braised pig trotters) and to more expensive fresh seafoods like live Octopus & Abalone to go with the Korean Shoju. But what amazes me the most is the ""Ganjang Gejang"", a Korean traditional disk that uses raw... (you read me correctly...) 'raw' crabs/prawns/fish roes lightly marinated with either soyu-based sauce, or more spicy bean paste sauce. As for rest of Gangjang market, we saw lots of shops selling mainly traditional Hanbok, beddings materials and some ladies fashions. For those who have plans to visit/ or have visited Dongdaemun (1 subway stop away), could perhaps consider sparing some time (around 2 hours) and some space (in your stomach) to check out this interesting Gwangjang market.",Positive
332,"Gwangjang Market is a traditional market in Seoul.you can go by subway till Jongno 5 ga,exit 12..and cross the road. In this market,they sell various food..but i think it's similar from 1 stall to another.. And you can buy snacks here..peanuts etc",Negative
333,"Came here Saturday evening with friends to try the famous mung bean pancakes. We ended up making our way around the market trying mini kimbaps, japchae, tteokbokki, and the mung bean pancakes from different stalls. Everything we tried was delicious.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is that other food markets I've been to have more variety. Definitely worth a visit though for the food and local vibe!",Positive
334,Locals come here for dinner and the food served here in the open stalls is catered to the local taste-buds. Definitely worth a try and the experience.,Positive
335,"Nice markets, it was huge and lots of entrance, you can find almost everything local. The foods abit on the pricier side.",Positive
336,"This market has everything but the food alley towards the eastern end is the main draw card for visitors which is vibrant and full of colour. A wide variety of fish, vegetables and meat on offer mostly deep fried. We tried the pancakes which were delicious albeit a little oily. Easy walk to either DDP or Jongmyo. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.",Positive

338,"This market is famous for delicious food street, especially raw meat. I enjoyed some foods here and everything is so affordable price.",Positive
339,I love to explore and experience the culture of the country I visit. This market was so so nice to visit. Not many tourists....lots of Koreans eating and chatting. Old women cooking korean food. You just sit anywhere you like and eat what seems delicious. If you love markets....food...and new tastes....this market is a must. I warmly recommend this market!! I lived it! I was a bit hard to find but that was bcuz I got lost. Ask ppl and they will show you the directions. It's near the canal and have metro near it. I was on the streets and was looking g for something else initial and got lost. But if you start with visiting this market it's easy to find if you follow the map,Positive
340,Indulge in delicious local food with the locals.  Indulge in shopping their local foodstuff and souvenir.  This is definitely a great place to absorb the Korean culture.,Positive
341,"Great place to go as they have many street food along the market. The only problem is, they might not be able to speak English and will be hard to order (pricing is not listed well so better ask before ordering).",Positive
342,"You can discover in this market many Korean street food such as mandus, kimchi, gimbap (Korean rice rolls)...",Neutral
343,"A busy Asian market: crowded, noisy, with unfamiliar items, but that's part of the experience of going! The highlight was definitely the mung bean pancake. The stall we ate at was in the middle of intersecting paths - yum",Positive
344,"When I was there, It's about dinner time (5PM). Shops on the main street were closed, but the food streets were very crowed with tourists and residents who were having meal with their familiars. Bibimbab, Gimbab, variouse fried-pancakes and more like to serve for everyone even fresh seafood (OMG). Just visit there in the afternoon, you will find thing are interesting than my experience",Positive
345,"If you are looking for a place for shopping, it may not be a good choice as it is mainly a fabric market, with limited shops selling seafood, snack, and fruits. However, near the Eastern gate, there are loads of shops selling traditional food such as the raw octopus, and traditional noodle. Some oof them provided English and Chinese menu. Better compare the price before sitting down as the price are quite different in different shops.",Negative
346,"A big market for bibimbap, pancakes, cut-noodles, japchae, Chilli rice cakes etc. English menu (small prints) are hung up at the front of the stalls. Be careful to read the menu.. we saw one that says dog meat.  The market is also good for getting souvenirs at a cheaper rate than myeongdong or namdaemun. If you like to get fresh ginseng or kimchi, you can find these there too. We bought fresh ginseng to attempt making samgyetang and the store wrapped it very nicely in baking sheets and then in plastic wrap.  There is a large kitchenware store run by an elderly couple who speaks English. He introduce us to different grades of metal utensils and warns us against buying cheap & poor quality utensils made-for-tourists that can be found in the touristy areas.",Positive
347,A must-see tourist spot. Go there for breakfast. Line of stalls for people to sit there and eat. Traditional market for tourists and convenient from the station.,Neutral
348,"Definitely worth a visit to this market even if you don't sew. Mainly sells fabrics, national costumes and great food. If staying in Seoul catch a taxi to the market, approx $8Aud.",Positive
349,A traditional market with almost anything you want to live seafood. At first I was wanting to visit this place as it was featured on many tv programs. Got there and was greeted with a full stench of seafood market and crowds of people gathering in the middle eating trotter or some type of offals. then in the middle of the market things got really crowded. I managed to find a good spot in the middle of the market where they have tteokboki and hotteok and the famous Gimbab. All is good but after a while at the market I was really missing the comfort of a modern place and not getting bumped by every passerby. Food was great but you will need to bear with the other aromas around you after all it is a traditional market.,Positive
350,"Get everything from hanboks to the most authentic Korean street foods such as jokbal, soondae and bindaeddeok. it's a wonderful throw back to the marketplace lifestyle that's been largely gentrified now in Seoul.",Positive
351,"Go early in the morning before the crowds appear! You will not be disappointed. It was originally a market for clothings and related materials etc, but in the centre of the market is the food stalls. There are so many choices. Go to whichever one you fancy, sit on the bench in front of the stall and order. Eat with the locals - though I must say there are lots of tourists too. A good experience.",Positive
352,"It is an everyday market where you can enjoy food, fashion and everything at reasonable price. It is open almost all day long, usually from 9am to 23pm. Famous dishes include Soonhee's Bindaetteok (mung bean pancake) and mayak gimbap (mini Korean sushi rolls).",Positive
353,"3-5 mins walk from subway (Jongno 5-ga Station-Line 1), Exit 8. The food very nice and not expensive, as it considers street food varieties. You can see a lot of fruits, hanbok, cooking utensils, etc over here. There is a big stall selling all snacks, candy just at the entrance of the market.",Positive
354,We went there for an evening meal after doing the Stream. The traditional mung bean cakes (Bindaetteock) are a must if you have tried them before. We sampled other pancakes as well but did not match the valour of the Bindaetteock. As other commenters have said there are arguments with some people but it would not be a market without this.  Pick a spot that has good sit down area - you will appreciate it after a long day and packed with Korean local. Be clear about what you want and there will be no problems. A kind thank you to the owner paves the way for next tourist.,Positive
355,"When I reached there about 4-5PM, almost shops were closed. so, I go directly to the food zone. Local food shops are available and so crowded.",Positive
356,"A long street of items, mostly food stalls, selling more or less the same items here and there. Pick a store of your liking and eat with the locals over there. Some stores are more popular as they may have feature in blogs before, thus you may have to wait for a short period of time. If not, you are choose the lesser crowded store for a simple meal in the local way.",Positive
357,"I went with my European friend who visited Korea for the first time to show him a Korean local market food. As soon as we got in the food section. people were luring us very loudly and kept forcing us to order. That was also quite annoying for us to decide the shop. My friend asked me a name of the food, so I just was watching without asking. Then the owner, understood English, said chicken and started to prepare the dish even we did not order nor seating, whatso ever. My friend didn't want to. So we walked. All of sudden, behind us , the lady started insulting, shouting us swering words in Korean! I was very very startled and offended. When we chose a shop nearby for a glass noodle, the owners were not nice either even if we ordered the dish. And kept us pushing order more dishes. It was around 10 pm after dinner, we went just for snacks, but most of ladies(owners) were rude, and very harsh! As far as I know, this spot has been quite famous and popular but with this kind of rudeness and ill-mannered ways, I have doubt about their longevity. When I tasted the food, it is below average taste. Of Course it is cheap food. I could also see some flies on the unwrapped food in the air. I wondered how these food will survive during the hot summer! They do not have any hygienic concept, I guess. I could see they do not clean their hands properly to serve after eating something. There are a few seating restaurants which are kind and nice with better food in this place, but I should have searched in advance and should come during the daytime. I do not recomend the open air shops to eat.",Negative
358,"A lot of traditional Korean food in the market with low price. There are three main streets in the market and lot of food trunks line up in the market. I like this place and go for food hunting every single time I go to Seoul. The ""ahchuma"" (the ladies in food trunk) are good enough to feed you.",Positive
359,"May not be the cheapest but for sure brings a local flavour. Game for local food? This would be the convenient place as many are found. The Mungbean cakes are probably the most favourite by the crowds, around 4k each which is a decent portion for 2-3 people. Morning is crowded, noon or just after lunch time is better if you asked me.",Positive
360,"Went to the clothes section first and the stalls were already packing up. Decided to venture further down and the food and wet market was thriving with activity. Many stalls were selling similar food, snacks and drinks so be sure to compare before buying.  Try to have a meal in the market where Uig can sit on benches or small stools and see the ahjummas prepare the food in front of you. Though their English competency is poor, surprisingly most could speak Mandarin. I'd suggest you try to speak Mandarin if you can.  Tip: get pre-packed samgyetang ingredients here. They include a large ginseng in them which would make great souvenirs to ppl who love to cook. Can't find them in e-mart, homeplus and other supermarkets",Positive
361,"This is a fun market to spend an hour or two. It's not so big, there's no real need for one of the tourist maps. There are not many tourists if you come here around 11am. At around 1pm it gets busier.  The market has a bunch of different sections. Selling kitchenware, clothes, fabrics etc. Most of these didn't really catch our attention. Some stalls are selling quite good and fresh looking fish and other seafood. But we were staying at a Hotel...so no need for that.  By far the most interesting part are the food lanes. Even though many stalls are selling the same stuff it's still a feast for your eyes. If you love offals/organs you'll find some treats here. But also the typical ""pancakes/omeletts"" made out of mashed beans (deep-fried) which taste great. And countless soups/hot-pots with a huge array of different veggies.  Places and tables here are small and quite limited. Some stalls packed....some quite empty. I guess the locals know more than us tourists.  There is actually a 2nd floor...but nobody seems to wander around there unless you came here for something specific. A fun little market, but actually you only need to see the food section.  If you have limited time only in Seoul and you only can visit one market, I would choose the Namdaemun Market. Bigger, better, more fun, more food, more stuff!  Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile.",Positive
362,"Where can I start.  Gwangjang market is like nothing you have seen before. Numerous food stalls and lots of friendly locals.  You will need to be brave to sample what's on offer and its best to have a good look around first before you decide what goes on your plate!  This place is very kind to your pocket, I spent a good couple of hours here and hardly spent anything.  This is a must see place if you are travelling to Soeul.",Positive
363,"So much food to choose from. You can eat with the locals and it's cheap as well compared to other places. There is limited seating if you go during busy times. We mainly went to eat but saw the market stalls, and we did get lost but was so glad we found the food stalls.",Positive
364,The Gwangjang market is quite large. It's basically a + sign extended very far in each direction. If you try to enter the market area from near the train station you will encounter a hug textile market and get lost in the process. I can't even explain how to navigate your way out of it.  The food is very repetitive. You'll see the same thing 20 times so if you see something you like just sit down and eat.  It was decent but not great. The novelty for me was how crazy busy it was and how quickly the staff work.  Heaps of seafood so if you don't eat seafood you will struggle.  Grab a hotteok outside on the street stalls before you leave if you can find it. Hotteok is the best.,Negative
365,"Gwangjang Market is a great cultural and food experience. Everything from knick knacks, beautiful clothes and blankets, and everything you can imagine to eat. So fun watching the cooking stalls prepping the food, and seeing all the interesting food. Great place for dumplings and pancakes. Wish I had all day to eat my way through this site.",Positive
366,The best textile market. Many hand made farmers. You can be fitted and clothing seen for you. Seamstresses in the isle ways working and also in the shops. This is Hanbok haven!!,Positive
367,Gwangjang Market is a traditional wet market in Korea. It has many hawkers selling local food and stuffs. Many people will go there for their food. It's really fun to walk one round in the market to see how the local hawkers doing business and what interesting food they have. A good experience and interesting place to visit !!,Positive
368,"This is their local fish and food market. They have lots of food and a fun experience to try it out. They have small seating area around the table. Interesting. We tried the clam soup, it was good.",Positive
369,"My girlfriends and I recently visited Seoul and although I have been to Seoul numerous times before, I have never been to this market.  We took the subway there and it was not difficult locating the market. We were hunting for good local food and found them at the bibimbap stall no. 39 where we ordered the famed dish along with some dumplings, octopus and chicken feet. I didn't fancy the chicken feet but my friends sang praises of it. In fact, we went to the same stall several days later and we ordered pretty much the same thing. Each dish was 5k Korean won.  After tucking into the food, we went around hunting for local souvenirs. This can be found scattered all around the markets. In fact, many shops carry similar goods and all one would need to do is to find the best prices for the goods.  Later on, we stopped to have one of the pancakes but it was huge and we could only finish half of it amongst the 5 of us ladies.  You would need about half a day or slightly over that at least to do justice to this place. The market is only a short distance from the famous Dongdaemun market along with the many fashion malls.",Positive
370,"We visited the market a couple of time to look around and purchased freshed fruits and vegies, dried seafoods, cloths and accessories. We didn't try any local foods as they are high in carbs. If you want to purchase Korean gifts and modern and traditional clothings items and cloths this place is highly recommended for variety and price.",Positive
371,"I enjoyed my 10 am breakfast of hot bowl noodle dumpling soup in this market. I bought a lot of almond yogurt for me to bring home. The price is cheaper than the groceries. I had the pancake, kimbob and preserved octopus being bought by kilograms. I spent well my pasalubong budget money here. I will visit Gwangjang Market again when I come back.",Positive
372,I loved this little Market. We went at night time so a lot of the stalls were shut except for the main eating market area! its very raw and local and awesome. Not much english going on but lots of menus with pictures. Everyone is super friendly and the food is very fresh. We had a bowl of dumplings and noodle soup. And of course some kimchi on the side,Positive
373,"We visited the market on a tour as we wanted to see some unique food. The market is very large and sells lots of local street food as well as fabrics. Some stalls are by hawkers. Others sell unique local dishes such as a local cod soup, stuffed squid, and mung bean pancakes. There are lots of food stores which sell dry goods and vegetables. Would be of particular interest to those who are not from Asia and not used to food stalls.",Positive
374,"Has everything you'd want to buy in Seoul or all of Korea.  Huge selection of food, both fresh and cooked.  Really a must see place.",Positive
375,"This rather small market is a definite Seoul Must-go-to place. Try Korean dishes along with the locals, and don't be shy in your choice of food: you'll be rewarded with the appreciation of the local guests, the curiosity of the stand cooks and an incredible palette of unusual tastes.(My favs were the seafood booths). The local pork rice sausage was also delicious.",Positive
376,"Interesting place to visit. But don't be fooled by the aunties at the stall.. They will tell you to come forward (with hand gestures) and make you sit down and eat something from their stall. It is a kind gesture, so it seems hard to say no.",Positive
377,"I have a weak spot for markets, especially ones with food. There is no shortage of that here! Actually came here twice over my weekend visit~ There are a lot of textiles and whatnot, but my focus was more on getting as much delicious and cheap food into my body as possible~! The lady vendors are very nice and engaging, also had a nice experience trying Sannakji here while the ladies were having their staff meal. Definitely recommend.",Positive
378,"Huuuuuuge. Well laid out with different sections for different products. The street food area was absolutely brilliant - very difficult to choose an option. Good for souvenirs, fish, groceries. Oh and traditional Hanbok costume.",Positive
379,"Lots to shop and eat but crazy crowded! We were pushed, grabbed and elbowed by the crowd, mainly the elderly ladies. Be prepared to brave the madness during weekends! Despite that we still enjoyed a scrumptious and authentic lunch over there. Bought some local goods and made our way out right after!",Positive
380,"It's kind of a traditional place to eat at night, street food everywhere, any kind of, delicious potato pancakes, blood sausages, kimpab, pork legs etc. the most popular there is raw beef with raw egg on the top - long lines of people could waiting for their turn outside. Also raw and alive octopus is very delicious here",Positive
381,This is not a typical tourist trap but a place locals come to shop so a great glimpse into everyday Korean life. All different types of stalls in a compact area selling everything from fabric & bedding to food & clothing.,Positive
382,My sole purpose coming here was to find some fabric to take home for my wife. She is constantly making crafty items for others and for sale. The place is quite busy and you have large selections of different foods to choose from. I did not think it was hard to get around however you are to step aside when viewing it you could be pushed on someone else. Lots of cheap eats here if you are on a budget.,Negative
383,The market is quite compact and easy to navigate around if you come at night time as all the shops have closed. Plenty of food options to choose from. There are small restaurants on the side but there are also market stalls in the middle of the market when you sit and eat in front of the sellers. Price is very reasonable to eat in one of the stalls and portion is quite big. Love the Korean blood sausage.,Positive
384,"This place was interesting because it looked like a Korean version of the Philippines' Divisoria, and it was a bit fun to go circles in it but you'd definitely get lost if you're unfamiliar of the place.",Positive
385,"I was brought here by my Korean friend. The place was full of stalls selling korean daily food, and was busy serving mostly locals. They are open as a market during the day and turned into sort of like a food junction at night. Very interesting.",Positive
386,"Went to Gwangjang market as part of the day tour I have booked myself for.  For anyone who has never been to a live market, well this is the place you have to visit! Lots of stalls varying from sales of textiles to live seafood.  Sit yourself down at any of the food stall to enjoy live octopus, freshly fried pancake or bimbibap make on the spot. This market used to be frequented by locals only and as more and more tourists requested to have a feel of the local lifestyle, Gwangjang market became a intersection for the curious tourists and local folks.",Positive
387,"This is a great place to eat lots of different food like tempura, seafood and many other dishes. And compared to other places it's pretty cheap. Even our 2 small kids (2 and 6) loved the place and the food! We had a great time and experience.",Positive
388,"This is a market where you find lot of local food and shopping options. You would not be able to find fashionable clothes but if you are shopping for your elderly folk at home, there's lots of options.  Local food like mung bean pancake, live octopus, and blood sausage can also be found here. Some of the ajummas selling them can speak Chinese too. A must visit.",Positive
389,"This market was not too far from the subway station, less than 5 minutes I think. The market was big with 5 food alleys where we had dinner and found the dishes were delicious and cheap (of course!). Besides that, my family also tried a lot of different banchan (kimchi mostly) at various shops. This is a very great place to explore local culture and cuisine for those who visit Seoul for the first time like us!",Positive
390,This is just approximately 500m from the ibis Ambassador Seoul Dongdaemun Hotel. What a nice surprise!,Positive
391,"This market is by far the best one i have visited because of the people i met (shop owner). The one i like best is Mr Na Derk Yum (sorry did not get his shop name) a souvenir shop owner. He loves Abba and play their song always. He is a very funny guy, he dance the 70's moves for us and he know who is Joseph Schooling. (know where i am from, right?) He also gives discount and free gift.",Positive
392,Great market food experience. Many stalls with tons of options. Recommend to keep orders small to try as many dishes as possible :),Positive
393,This market sells everything. Busy even on a weekday. Don't use a stroller there as some of the aisles especially near the food stalls and linen section are really narrow. Good place if you want to buy souvenirs and hanboks. Many food stalls selling everything from pancakes to live octopus.,Positive
394,"One of my friend want to try the ""Squiggling octopus"" he found on a documentary (and lots of youtube clip), so we looked for someplace local.  We were here around 20am and the place is packed with people. Most food stalls has English menu, so language is not a problem. The food looks the same across various stalls, but that's not a problem for us since the is our first time anyway.",Positive
395,Full of local and tourist who were on a food hunt. This is a place to go for some local food.Recommended to walk around before ordering as there are some stalls who had the same menu. Wish we could have the capacity to eat more as there is so many things to eat but we were full from just 3 types of food as the servings was huge.,Positive
396,"WOW interest Market, A must see and visit. Food outlets flat out and market huge. Had a great sit down meal and enjoyed the ambience . Can catch the subway and or a 20 minute walk from our hotel next Chungmuro Station",Positive
397,"If you are daring then try the live octopus :-P Real Korean silk is KRW 25,000 ++ for 4 meters. Don't be fooled by the KRW 10,000 price tags. HWSK gives discount for Malaysians. Pathways are slightly narrow and there are some idiots that drive their motorbike through the market to deliver/transport.",Positive
398,"I enjoy walking through this market - all the varieties of food stalls, different types of seafood on display at fish vendors...all the locals are eating great local cuisine.",Positive
399,"I miss Asian market; particularly a traditional night market with lots of food stalls and fresh groceries. It was on top of my list to visit since I learned of it from a travel book. Sadly, I did not get to try any of the pancakes. Still, it is pure entertaining to people watch and enjoy the sight. I bought few dry food; and now realize that I probably could/should have bought a lot more! It was slightly overwhelming but fun. t would recommend anyone not to miss this experience.",Positive
400,"Looking for authentic Korean food, don't missed it to know more about South Korea at the oldest traditional street market, Gwangjang.",Positive
401,"Visit this market is a must if you will travel to Seoul. Many things to see, buy, eat, you will find that Korean people is kind.",Positive
402,"I hit this place up everytime I visit Seoul. Most, if not all, of the food is delicious and affordable. My favourites would be the mayak kimball and mungbean pancakes. Some places even offer english menus, but pointing and gesturing works for ordering as well! Eating in a bustling market definitely adds to the experience, definitely not one you'll get from a typical restaurant.",Positive
403,"I'd rather say traditional food market cause I'm not a big fan of traditional stuff except for FOOD! If you happen to come here, please try the Bindaetteok (Mung Bean Pancake), it's quite oily but worth it. The crispiness and the texture, omg and the sauce (onion and soy sauce i think), I CANNOT. Besides, there's this raw seafood plater which is incredibly good! I would eat San nakji (Raw minor Octopus). A lot of people couldn't stand looking at it cause it's cut into smaller pieces and because they are raw, they're still wriggling and jiggling HAHAHA. But I love it. Go and try for yourselves.",Positive
404,"Great beef tartare as well as some raw seafood and sashimi. They have other stuff like Korean sushi and pancakes, etc. Overall a very traditional market and definitely a must visit if you are looking for something a bit more original and traditional. I scored two kid hanboks for 30 bucks total and that price cannot be beat!",Positive
405,"Get your eyes full and stomach full of Korean food craving fulfilled here.  Experience the madness of a traditional market with colorful kimchi, food wares and cheap stuff.",Neutral
406,"This is the place to go to eat like the locals. There are stalls everywhere mainly set up through the middle of each long corridor with restaurants along the side.  Each ""stall"" will cook their specialty for you. Price ranges between 5000 - 10000 won. It's communal seating and if you are there during winter, the seats are heated too!  So many options that you won't know what to order. Best order and share from one stall and then move on to another.  There are also other stalls which sells their side dishes, seafood, dried foods, cakes etc. Quite a good place to walk around.",Positive
407,"Walking around in this area gives you an understanding of Seoul traditions. People are nice and not aggressive. Its a busy area, but a must see",Positive
408,"We came here on our 12 hour layover from LAX to Chiang Mai. I've never been to South Korea so I figured it would be a good chance to see a little of it for free. We took a 5 hour free tour from ICN which took us to a village and the market. I wanted to try Bulgogi in Korea so we found a place but it was just ok. Next we tried the dumplings and dumpling soup. These were better than the bulgogi, but we were full and couldn't try anything else.",Positive
409,Love the bad set. Very sweet and comfy. The cotton were very cheap and affordable. here is where to get cheap souveniors,Positive
410,"This place is always a delight to visit! I have gone three times now. Once in the summer, fall, and even winter. When the heat is too much to bear it's nice to get a cold bowl of Namyeong and when's it's freezing in Korea hot tteokbokki always hits the spot. They even warm the benches for you in the winter. All in all the food is amazing and the atmosphere is fascinating. This is a must see and experience in Seoul!",Positive
411,"This is a great place to add to the itinerary during your stay in Seoul. It was very busy and a bit chaotic but a sign of a very good place when it comes to eating there. The food on offer was impeccable. We had the chance to try 'raw octopus' for 15,000 Won. Be prepared for crowds but well worth it",Positive
412,This is one of my favorite place to go every year when I visit to Korea. It is like time square in New York but all shopping center. There has many things to eat and buy. Specially night time is perfect time to visit. Highly recommend to stop by.,Positive
413,"It used to be an interesting place but it was too exposed on media. Different kinds of food may look nice on t.v. but the taste wasnt that good. If it is on the way, it is ok to drop by, but no need to plan to visit.",Negative
414,"Come hungry. We had a one day stopover in Seoul and chose this market for lunch. So glad we did. Fortunately we had taken in a historical morning walk and palace tour before we arrived because we were ready for lunch. Note: Walk the whole food sections before you sit down to eat. There is a wide variety of stalls and types of food. Pick the one, two or more that appeal to you most, then try something you have no idea what it is!. Ddeokbokki, bibimbap, kimchi, bindaetteok, pajeon, kimbap, jasaek goguma to name just a few. Some of the portions can be overwhelming so bring a friend, order a variety and share. After you have had your fill, finish walking the multiple lanes of stalls of local made wares, household goods, fabrics and anything else you could think of. Then grab some cookies and candies to take home for later after you have recovered. Be prepared for the crowds, it is a popular place and seats can be few.",Positive
415,"I've had foreign friends visit this place multiple times and they have told me that nothing beat this experience. Especially the food here is very authentic as it is humble and can be a quite unique dining experience. It tends to get crowded and even for a person who hates being in crowded places can enjoy this place as it is a unique scene to see hundreds eat and drink during late nights. I recommend that no one neglects this special gem, it is truly a Korean dining and cultural attraction that will give you the first foot into this city.  My personal recommendation is: Eating Nok Do Pancakes and Soju and Makguli at SooENae, which is located in the center of the market.",Positive
416,"I had some street food at Gwangjang Market in which I don't normally do because I have a bad stomach. The street food at Gwangjang was so tempting, I just couldn't say NO.",Negative
417,"Market was easy to locate and took my family to try some mung bean pancake. As the only person in tm family to understand and speak korean (even though I am not korean) we then went to some stalls as I took my family to try market food. Went to a stall that served spicy rice cakes, japchae, odeng and various foods. I ordered the spicy rice cakes but the women gave me odeng instead and wouldn't take back the odeng even though we hadn't touched it. Was not impressed but had to have it and ordered the spicy rice cake elsewhere.",Negative
418,This is the place to be if you are feeling hungry near Dongdaemun. You will find lots of authentic korean food to fill your tummy.,Positive
419,"Great place to try street style korean food. Many options, some are delicious. Cultural. Worth visiting at night time.",Positive
420,"Went to the clothes section first and the stalls were already starting to close even though it was only around 6pm. Maybe it was because it was eve of Seollal. However, when we arrived at the market at ground floor, the place was bustling with activity. We enjoyed the street food and even sat down twice to enjoy pajeon and other various seafood with japchae at another stall. There were also many shops selling similar snacks and health foods such as ginseng. Their prices differ so don't buy at the first stall.",Positive
421,"I stumbled on this market quite by coincidence while just roaming. I tried the Kyoja here. This place was interesting enough to come twice - once by chance, and the other time by design. The second time, I looked at the other wares sold there and bought a neck pillow that had a case made from traditional fabric. This place is interesting, the storekeepers are very friendly, and it's a good place to just be.",Positive
422,came to gwangjang market to eat and there are literally lots of food to eat. And they are all delicious! I tried tobboki (not sure how to write it) and gimbab.,Positive
423,"Ugh! As a Korean, I feel so bad foreigners come here and have to eat fake, dirty, over-priced food. The market seems big, but when you look around you will realize most sellers sell similar food with same price.  If I must recommend one market for you, i will guide you to either Tongin Market near by Gyeongbok palace or Mangwon Market near Hongdae.  If you really really want to see what Gwangjang market looks like, just look. Don't try food here :( especially if you are trying street food for the first time.",Negative
424,"I come here for breakfast every time I go to Seoul. Amazing street food guaranteed to fuel your whole day activities. Very friendly ahjummas if you speak Korean, but even if you don't, it's not very hard to explain to them what you want. The market is very neat and clean, not your typical Asian wet market.",Positive
425,Majority of the food stores sells the same food. So there's not much variety of food to choose. Not that fantastic for me as the stores are half opened when i was there during lunch time. Would go back only when i don't have other place to go.,Negative
426,"Gwangjang market is one of the oldest and the largest functioning market in South Korea with around 5000 vendors selling different things like food, textile, etc.Seriously, Gwangjang market is the culmination of the diverse and delicious flavors of Korean street food. There are plethora of food to choose from but don't miss their gimbap and tteokboki (rice cake in spicy sauce). With 20 USD worth of Korean money, you can get a nice lunch of your choice.  Gwanjang market offered some of the best street food I have eaten so far. It's a mix of old and new, modern and traditional, all under one roof. As long as you keep your mind open to new flavor and taste, you will likely to enjoy your visit in this market.  The market is clean and there are paid toilets (clean as well). Other than food, you can also find textile shops, even traditional medicine ingredients shops. Perfect place to get authentic Korean souvenirs with bargain price.",Positive
427,"We came here twice in our visit just because the food is really good, although it does get busy and a little noisy.",Positive
428,"Good food, Good exprience. A lot of food to choose. It is a big market. A market in Seoul which you should NOT missed.",Positive
429,Went there to see local food and look around and ate a delicious dumpling soup with Kimchi with locals at stand #3 where they spoke enough english to help me and teach me how to eat things properly!,Positive
430,"When there for lunch. Street food - fish cake, red bean bun, green bean pancake, pork pancake etc. Lots of stalls selling dumpling soup. Walkable from the subway station. Lots of traditional shops selling pots & pans, mattress etc",Positive
431,"Interesting to visit but don't bother eating here. 99% of people eating there are tourists with about 95% tourists from PRC. We tried one stall and had fish cake in soup (KW3000) , pig intestines (KW10,000), rice cake in spicy sauce (KW2000), fried glass noodle (KW3000) and one bowl of rice. We were charged KW22.000. We couldn't figure out how it came to KW22,000. Did the bowl of rice cost KW4000!? We could have eaten better food in a proper restaurant for the same price. Definitely not worth the money for street food.",Positive
432,"We loved our foodie excursion at this market. There are different kinds of food to choose from. This is also the market that was featured in different variety shows like Running Man. This is a great place to eat local korean food, cheap and delicious! Of course be prepared to speak Korean as they don't speak english here!",Positive
433,This is a really good place to have your meal and taste local food. Some of the recommended food to try here are the pancakes and the dumpling which is located almost end of the street. This is also a good place to purchase food products and local tidbits.,Positive
434,Easily accessible from the subway. Good place to eat but the much hyped tekbokki and pancakes are so so only and expensive. The mungbean pancakes are good. Some stores are very friendly. A must go place in Seoul.,Positive
435,"We went only at night, when majority of the shops were closed. But the food street was open, many stalls selling similar foods. But it all tasted good. Helped that the food looked good as well!",Positive
436,Place of full visitors looking to try out the local food. Visited a stall which sold local food and Noddle soup was fantastic. There was never ending of customers who came and ate the stall especially for the vegetables pancake and bimbap. It was strange seating on a hot bench. There was another stall selling fresh seafood stew/soup (I think). The customers was given stools to seat outside the shop. It must be good as the local Koreans was not queuing for it.,Positive
437,"Main purpose for coming to this market - dinner. At this place, one can sit down in the many stalls in front of the cooks, order and eat on the spot. The only reference that I got is to go for the stalls with the largest number of people. We bought the pancake and brought it with us as we sat down for the mandu (dumplings) - the stall owner said ""OK"".  After dinner, we just walked around the various stalls selling souvenirs - bought the honey butter almonds and fresh pomegranate juice.",Positive
438,"Got off at the wrong subway station but that's how fun adventures come about. We hit the almost empty market at around 10pm and followed the laughter and shouting and came across a whole range of stalls selling food (the happy sounds were from Koreans drinking soju, the national drink - gotta say, the Koreans do like a drink!). I tried food that I hadn't even hear of before: sea pineapple (an edible sea squirt - believe me, its more of a squirt than a pineapple; think slippery and slimy, and looking like an ugly squat alien cucumber, served as sashimi; only for the brave), sundae (made by boiling or steaming cow or pig's intestines that are stuffed with rice), tteokbokki: thick dumplings in a spicy sauce; boiled big heart, spongy and tart. And off we went into the night.",Positive
439,"Gwangjang Market is one of my favourite places to explore in Seoul, also one of the oldest traditional markets in South Korea. At Gwangjang Market, you must try the Bindaetteok (Mung Bean Pancakes), a snack that's greatly loved by the locals. It goes down really well with Makgeolli (rice wine)!",Positive
440,"Local Korean food in the street food atmosphere. Various type of Foods, seafood, steaming, hotpot or fried. Don't expect that you will sit in a nice restaurant because it will be just a bar seat, eat and go. Just pick one, the most long queue. There are also clothing and tourists stuffs available in the market.",Positive
441,Spent 2 hours there.  Tried ahujma pancake and live octopus.  Local fruits distribution - grapes and strawberries 👍🏻,Neutral
442,"visited there to try yuk-hoi(uncooked beef), but it's far too hyped and not worth it especially with that much of people and hassle.",Negative
443,"Its a huge covered market with everything from street food to souvenir to fabric and more. If you can fit it in your schedule, its worth an hour or so strolling in it.",Positive
444,This market is in the middle of the oldest part of Seoul. There are many indoor and outdoor restaurants. The pancakes are the specialty. You can also browse the flea market type stalls selling anything from food to clothing.,Neutral
445,"Heaps of stalls, cheap food. It ranges from the confrontational live octopus kind to straightforward vegetarian friendly options. Its cooked fresh, the locals are happy to squeeze up and make room for you, nobody minds if you don't speak Korean. I had a ball.",Positive
446,"In the three-month summer holiday vacation, I travelled to Seoul, which is the capital of Korea. Korea is a country that gathers different kinds of snacks and food. This time my friend takes me to a traditional market of Korea which called Gwangjang Market. We go there by subway. Gwangjang Market is a local market for people to seek the delicious and naïve food. Actually, we know this place through a very famous television programme called Running Man. The television programme also visits the market before. As we all know, most of the Korean food are spicy. There are all kinds of traditional snacks in the market for you to have a try, like rice cake, breaded fish stick, fried chicken and so on. The most unforgettable food for me is eating the raw octopus, the feeling is really special. I advise the tourists can take it as a lunch or supper as there are many choices to choose.",Positive
447,"We came to Korea from tropical Saipan in December, inconveniently lacking winter clothes. Hit up the secondhand market area and got ourselves some warm, funky clothes on the cheap, followed up with a great little lunch. Much better prices here than in the more touristy areas.",Positive
448,"Metro stop for Gwangjang market is Euljiro 4. Once you enter street level, head N. After one block, you'll be crossing an intersection which is a bridge across a narrow stream below. Before the next major intersection, there will be entrances to the market on the E side of the street. For the food zone entrance, head E (right) at the major intersection.  The mungbean pancakes & the gimbap are vegetarian delights. The bibimbap can be. If not, have the meat 86ed. Herbivores won't be disappointed if you're into cabbage, fresh herbs, grains, sprouts, & red peppers.",Positive
449,"This market gives you a taste of the local culture in Seoul. For a unique local experience, have your lunch or dinner here. Avoid weekends at nights as it can get extremely crowded.",Negative
450,"There were many food stands, household items, and clothing. Almost anything can be found here. The food stands looked really good as they cooked much of the food in front of you.",Positive
451,"weird when shopping here but worth. what i mean shopping at here is you can buy a lot snacks from here with retail price ! believe me, cheaper than other places. regret never buy a lot. Great food here and crowded !",Negative
452,"This food stall market is a nice attraction for an hour or so. There is plenty of food to buy, but you'll see the same food being sold in stall after stall, e.g. rice cakes, mung bean pancakes (I bought one from the stall with the longest line - and wasn't impressed at all), etc. I also tried the dumplings and noodles in a popular stall - and wasn't impressed by the dumpling or noodles either. There are also places for people to sit within a stall, although you will have to be buying the food from that particular stall.  The market also seemed to be a little less clean than some of the other markets I've seen, so you should take that into account. I would also suggest going to other markets like Myeongdong if you desire a greater variety of food as Gwangjang serves the same stuff in many stalls... It did seem to be a place where locals went so even if you do not eat the food, it's an interesting place to visit.",Positive
453,"We came here via metro line 1 (Jongno 5-ga station) and walked a short while to the market. So it is quite accessible. Its southern side is flanked by the Cheongyecheon river, so a nice place for a walk after eating & exploring in the market.  It is a very busy place.  There is a wet and dry section of the market. The ""dry"" side retailed all manner of daily necessities such as textiles, apparel, shoes etc. The wet side has a stretch of hawkers selling seafood, vegetables etc.  Probably the highlight is the food section where there are many many cart stalls set in the middle of the alley ways. There are seating places in front of these stalls. Most, if not all of the visitors eating there seemed to be tourists!",Positive
454,"An average market. Plenty of local food available. However, personally I don't like the taste. If you have limited time in Seoul, you may skip this place.",Negative
455,Try the gimbap and pig trotters. Beware! Portions are huge! My personal favourite was the kalguksu (knife cut noodles) with pieces of zucchini and gim (seaweed). The mung bean pancake seemed to the draw for both local and tourists but I found it to be too heavy and oily for my liking. I had a nice piping bowl of red bean porridge which was a savory alternative to the usual sweet dessert we are so used to in Singapore. Get your kimchi here too!  I bought plain canvas tote bags for 2000 to 3000 won each from the traditional stores and some Korean knick knacks (much cheaper than Insadong). The bags were of good and sturdy material.  Plus there is a hidden second-hand market on the second floor.,Positive
456,"One of the best shopping destination for tourists looking for local products. Also there are a lot of store selling colorful Hanbok. There are Goods, accessories clothes in very inexpensive price.",Positive
457,"In this crowd and popular traditional market offer a good selection of Korean Street Food with a reasonable price such as Korean pan cake, sticky rice cake etc. So it is a one stop shop for Korean street food",Positive
458,"Said to be the biggest market, this place sells everything from clothing through traditional medicines to food. The place is known for traditional mung bean pancakes. It is not touristy and the majority of visitors seem to be locals. Worth a visit in the evenings.",Positive
459,"2nd visit here. It is a mixed of wet market with other stuffs. You can get clothes, blankets, daily essential, fruits & vegetables, and lots of seafood here.  What make it famous is the street food in the market. You can just sit down at the stalls & enjoy the freshly prepare food. As vegetarian, there choices are quite limited. But I like the Original Gwangjang toast by the old grandma at the end of the market & the red bean cake near the middle cross junction inside the market.  But my main purpose to be here is for the raw Korean Ginseng & the dried seaweed. We also bought a set of Korean cutlery, dried persimmon, nuts & snacks. We ended up with so much stuffs (enough to fill in 2 XL sized Longchamp bag) that we have to go back straight to our hotel:)",Positive
460,"We stopped by to have a quick browse of the market while walking past along cheongye stream to Dongdaemum. Should have saved my stomach to have our meal here as there was so much food to try. In the centre of the market there are heaps of little food stalls where they sell various korean food- street food. Dokbokki, soondae, gimbap, bindaeteok (mung bean pancake - a must try), bibimbap, savoury pancakes, noodles etc. Each stall has some seats surrounding it so you can sit down to eat or you can buy your food to take away.  I didn't get the chance to walk around the other areas of the market but i did walk past an area where they sold lots of fabric/ material and also saw quite a few stores selling packaged korean snacks",Negative
461,"good local foods with many choices, buy small portion so you can taste as much type of food, wet and dry market with clean environment, buy snack, traditional food pack, cloth material as souvenir",Positive
462,"This is a place for inexpensive shopping for fabrics, clothes etc with a section dedicated to a whole bunch of food outlets. The shopping is nothing extravagant but prices a were cheaper than in big shops. We went in late afternoon for a stroll in the shopping area (browsed stuff) and in the end, enjoyed a wide variety of Korean food complemented with a bottle of 'rice wine', which is a low alcohol drink (like beer). We got a combination plate that had about 8 different items. It was a great way to sample the wide spectrum of Korean street food. Though inside a busy market, the food outlets had space to sit inside. It is also good for people-watching as the locals teem for shopping and eating. Great to watch how the food is made then-and-there. However, the walking spaces are narrow and can be difficult to maneuver when crowded.",Positive
463,Went to this place for breakfast and many stalls sell korean food. We can eat there as they provide stools to sit and can take away also. You can buy many korean snacks and food also here. Price is cheaper than supermarket or others sold at Namdaemun market.,Neutral
464,"I came here for the second time to buy banchan (Korean side dishes) to bring back home. The first time we came, we brought back some fermented squid side dish but in small quantity. We regretted it then since it was very delicious. This time round, we couldn't buy much too since my sister had just given birth and was not allowed to have seafood for a few months. There's even marinated raw crab which we loved when we bought it the first time round. Just tell the person that you need to take it back home on flight and they will be willing to seal-wrapped the food with no additional cost.",Positive
465,"It's one of the best places to try all the wonderful street food you've seen on TV or vlogs. A food lover and a photographer's paradise. Many of the stalls/vendors are famous, so you can be sure you're eating the best food.  It's a must-do experience. The atmosphere is amazing. The food is not only delicious, but cheap, as well.",Positive
466,"I love coming to these markets every time I'm in Korea, just to soak up the wet market atmosphere and to eat lots of delicious junk food! Come on an empty stomach and leave with takeout containers to last you another day or two.  Just to be clear - these aren't wet markets. There are fabrics, tailors, traditional embroiders, souvenir shops, and shops selling household items - but there are also people selling fresh fish, banchan, vegetables all adding to the chaotic atmosphere which I love.  My must have treats (in order. They will package everything in takeaway containers if you ask ""pojang hae joo saeyo"". 1. Crispy, hot bean pancakes dipped in vinegar sauce with onion pickles. Eat one, take a few away. Some will sell just the batter for you to fry up at home (look for ones that grind their own beans -pictured)  2. Mayak gimbap: literally, if you eat if you're think ""they've put crack in this. It's so addictive""  3. Soondae steaming hot vermicelli ""blood pudding"", sliced and dipped in the special shrimp-salt mix  4. Hobakjuk: steaming hot bowl of sweet pumpkin porridge thickened with glutinous rice flour. Heaven. 4= Patjuk: same as above but with red bean  Hint: If you're there in winter, pick up a bag of freshly roasted chestnuts outside (one of the street vendors on the kerb) and try eating a few with the above porridges. It is a marriage made in heaven, and a quite traditional combination. Also, make sure to ask if they will do a ""refill"" if you're dining in (Koreans also use the word ""refill"")  5. Twiggim: Korean version on tempura - battered, crispy shrimp and vegetables  The place is also great if you want fabric or hanbok made. It's not that friendly towards people who don't speak English, but not rude either. They will try to understand you. There's not much point looking at every stall as everything's practically just a repeat. If you see some seats become vacant in a busy looking stall, just pull up and point at what you want, and you'll do just great.  Not a great place to take strollers / not particularly wheelchair friendly unfortunately. Take breath mints if you're companion is sensitive to garlic and blood-pudding-breath like mine is!",Positive
467,"This is a traditional market selling food and daily necessaries. Many kinds of Korean eateries, and the portion is big. Worth a visit!",Positive
468,"You can buy traditional items here! It's cheaper and lots of shops which is easier to find. There are many shops that sell different types of kimchi. You can tell them you are buying back and taking a flight, they will help you wrap up . They sell lots of fabric and buttons . It is a textile centre!",Positive
469,"This market is great to experience Korean food delicacies. From bintteok (mung bean pancake) to raw octopus they have it here. The market is huge with lots of allies, and they also famous for fabrics. We tried many kinds of foods here: meat pajeon, soondae, dumplings, small raw crab kimchi, and a few others i can't remember. It's also a good place to shop for korean snacks as the price can be cheaper than convenience store. Just watch out for the old ahjummas that try to increase the price if you're a foreigner :) But it's a good place to visit, especially for the food and the local experience.",Positive
470,"If you like soondae, this is the place to go to! Very fresh, thick and perfectly tasting soondae! They also have other food there with plenty of places to sit. Fun environment to get pocha food. It was very crowded with lots of people eating and drinking together communal style.",Positive
471,"This is a must visit for tourist where they get to see and experience local Korean food, Pancake, and many other souvenirs. The pancake is the most popular dish and it's great to go with a bottle of magoli. The market is located nearest to Line 1 Jongno 5 Ga. The place is tourist friendly and vendors are nice and polite.",Positive
472,"Don't think you'll find much to buy unless you're in the market for traditional fabrics and clothing.  Lots of street food, might not appeal to everyone. You'll find more 'traditional' street foods like Kimbap, spicy rice cakes, odeng, bibimbap (vegetarian), lots of grannies and ahjummas gathered round for their meal time-gossip session (store holders involved).  The mung bean pancakes are yummy though! Crispy on the outside, and pure deliciousness inside! Doesn't taste anything like I would have imagined (I have a slight aversion towards anything with beans except beansprouts), in fact more like a thick rosti with extra ingredients inside. I'll skip the tempting-looking bowl of hand cut noodles next time though.",Positive
473,"It was crowded past afternoon. Most food stalls sell the same types of food. As we went on Sunday, some shops were closed.",Neutral
474,"1. Definitely Not a tourist market. It is the oldest market in Seoul and famous for fabrics and traditional clothing.  2. Best visited for the food, though YMMV. 4 food lanes, converging together in the middle in the shape of a cross. Mostly locals, with the occasional camera toting tourist gawking.  3. Open late for food, 'till midnight anyhow. Yet, this late sees only 1/4 or less food vendors open, although virtually every type of food served here, with one or two exceptions, will be found this late.  4. You can search youtube for videos of the market, showing which specific foods are available. Lots of choices, but no restaurants with menus.  5. Stopping by at lunch or dinnertime is great, the entire place is packed with locals eating and makes for a lively scene.  6. Be adventurous. Try things outside of your comfort zone.  7. Clean, sanitary environment, so don't worry about your belly.  8. Seating is by bench, ordering is as simple as pointing. Simple as that!  9. Best approach- walk all the isles, 4 with two lanes each so 8 rows really. Scope it all out, then pick two or three places to sit down and eat at. Order lots of variety, sample and share!",Positive
475,"The locals really enjoyed there. The market was a feast for the eyes but not quite up our alley. Expect tight seatings, unfamiliar tastes and drinks are served by other stalls unless you go for the small restaurants. Suitable for snacks rather than meals.",Positive
476,Our hotel was across the street from the gwangjang market. We came here for snacks and a couple times for lunch. There are a variety of outdoor stores and you should be able to find anything including counterfeit clothes.  The gem are the little small stalls with as affordable snacks and food.,Neutral
477,"Went to this market place for dinner and walk around. There are quite a lot of variety. From vegetarian to meat / seafood. And of course, a must eat on their pancakes (kimchi/seafood).  The difficult part is when you order your food, the locals do not understand English and will not know what we are referring to. Best to be more specific or try using google translate and show them what you want.  This market do sell quite a fair bit of dry products too. I bought some Butter Honey Nuts and lots of seaweeds snacks.",Positive
478,"Yes, there are lots of tourists here, but there are also many locals who come to eat. There is a great selection of food to try at very affordable prices, our favourite were the mung bean pancakes!  There is a metro exit next door to the market so it is easy to get to via public transport. Alternatively take a stroll down the canal which runs alongside the market.",Positive
479,There is a lot of street food here at very affordable prices. Fresh food and vegetables too. Good location is Seoul,Positive
480,"Food was mediocre at best. You can get better street food at other districts such as Hongdae or Ewha at a cheaper price. Many of the vendors are hostile too. The next morning, I talked to the receptionist at my accommodation about Gwangjang and she told me that Koreans find Gwangjang to be a ""terrible place"" (with her limited vocab) and asked who recommended me there. My advice is to skip this place and visit Namdaemun Market instead.",Positive
481,"This market is odd place, and that quizzicality could be explane like this: modern form of traditional market combined with touristic place.  Gwangjang market is famous with two factors: Traditional street foods & Market.  Street foods in Gwangjang market is unique. It could be compare with Jeon-Ju, that level high. Locals also visit well for Three famous foods; 육회Yukhoe(Korean beef tartare), 녹두전Nokdu-Jeon(Mung bean pancake), and 마약김밥Drug-Gimbap. If you interested in exotic foods, you should try these. Level of difficulties are like follows; Yukhoe >>>>>> Drug-Gimbap > Nokdu-Jeon.",Positive
482,"This pretty crowded market sell all kinds of korean street food, and snacks. Lots of stall selling fresh mung bean pancake with soju here, and a whole lot of other stuffs such as soft shell crabs, deboned chicken feed, blood sausage, etc. You can also get the live octopus here, if you don't feel like going all the way to Noryangjin fish market for it. We went around 5 pm on a holiday and it was very crowded, I heard from our food tour guide that in the morning there are less people and alot less crowded.",Positive
483,One thing about this place is it's your typical market. People selling food and stuff for a cheap price. The cleanliness of the place can be a bit doubtful but one can never be to careful. Someone recommended this place to me since i told them i haven't have Japche and Gimbop and i found them here however i was a bit dissapointed when one seller used her barehands to get the japche and place it in a plastic bowl for me to eat. The taste was really good though and i wasn't able to find other places selling it. Tried their mung bean pancake and it was good. We went here a little early so there wasn't much people and not everything was open yet. I think the best time to go here would be afternoon to night time.,Positive
484,It is a big market selling practically everything from modern traditionally Korean food to clothing etc. Bought a few packets of Korean ginseng with herbs and dried fruits. The price is reasonably cheap. Saw mostly local Korean customers with few foreigners. A little narrow and crowded. .,Neutral
485,"Gwangjang markes is huge and contains both food stalls, grocery shops, clothing and garment shops, kitchenware shops and more.  It is a well spent time just to walk around. And if you are hungry it is a great place to try some local cuisines. Korean dumplings, mungbean pancakes and hand-chopped noodles are just a few of them.",Positive
486,"The Gwangjang Market is nearby Dongdae Mun. I knew the place from Korean variety show – Running Man. They had some games and ate some delicious food in the traditional market. I was totally attracted with Gwangjang Market. Therefore, I recorded this place in my Korean schedule. It was my first time went to the market, so it was hard for me to find the location. Fortunately, met nice local people helped me to find market. Arrived the market around 6 p.m. so decide to have dinner in there. At the time, there was not so many people. A lot of stalls closed, most of them all sold the same type of food. I found a stall and seated to enjoy the food. The stall’s auntie was so friendly, she tried to speak a little Chinese to me. She was very cute, feed me to eat the food and then took picture. I was so surprised that her actions. It was an unforgettable experience in Seoul.",Positive
487,"Had a great time visiting this market, the different foods were just amazing, in fact there was so much to sample we had to go back another day. The mung bean pancakes were fantastic as well as the dumplings and the Korean fried chicken.All in all this is a must visit if you are visiting Seoul.",Positive
488,"This is just a ridiculously busy spot but we went back twice. The Mung bean pancakes which can be had from numerous sellers here is simply outstanding. I had a couple of varieties and enjoyed it all as well as spicy ricecakes, korean fried chicken, gimbap, sweet potato pancakes and the list goes on!",Positive
489,"This is one of very famous street markets with a long history. You can buy fabrics, hanboks(korean traditional clothing), beddings, among many other things! There is very famous eatery alley where sells many foods so you can taste with cheap price!",Neutral
490,Food stalls and hawkers are everywhere. You can find the traditional Korean food here. A bit messy and dirty.,Negative
491,"I was so glad the this gigantic market was just down the street from my hotel. It is a world of its own: over 200 stalls selling food; textiles, clothing, you name it! a MUST SEE!",Positive
492,"Be prepared to be astounded but if one wants authentic local food that caters to the locals, this is it. The best kimbap and fishcake soup I ever had from an old lady who works by herself, perfect with a side of cold soju.",Positive
493,"Covered market ,great when it rains. Everything from bedding to clothes. Fresh meats,fish ,and vegetables for sale. There is also great street food that delights the palate.",Positive
494,Great place to buy typical korean things or just to eat typical food. Do not be surprised by the number of people it is very very crowded but it is part of its charm.,Positive
495,"What I enjoyed: The experience of visiting and walking around a traditional Korean market, you will see lines of stalls with their food laid out/being cooked in front of you, and you can choose which stall(s) you fancy, take a seat at their benches/slim tables and eat. If you don't know Korean it's fine, pointing at the food to order would work as well, some of the stall owners can speak a little English/Chinese.  What I didn't enjoy that much: Was quite crowded when I visited. The food was average only, not the best I've had in other markets/other parts of Seoul.",Negative
496,"Foodies will want to see how delicious this place is! haha Every corners you can find street food, mungbean pancake, chopped noodle, rice cake, korean pork blood sausage, jabchae, bibimbab, dumplings, beef tartar, bbq restaurants... so many to talk about! When you finish one alley, you will be so full yet!",Positive
497,"This place has a variety of street food, however you can get this kind of food around Seoul from restaurants or street vendors. Its not worth the long visit and going out of your way to find it. And even though it's old, it's more dirty than charming. Worth skipping, do if you have extra hours to kill only.",Negative
498,"Hmmm this was a unique market filled with food stalls. This market is mostly visited by people in their 50's and older. The vendors sell food that most young Koreans don't eat. You can find ""typical Korean food"" like kimbap and jabchae but the market specializes in the unusual Korean food you see on American travel shows. Only recommended for the brave and curious.",Positive
499,This market is worth searching for if you want to eat cheap street food in bulk! The food wasn't the greatest we had in Seoul but we enjoyed the experience of sitting with locals at their tiny little food stalls and watching them make buckwheat noodles while we slurped our freshly made dumpling soup. So good to just sit around eating and people-watching! Afterwards we just roamed around the market trying different snack-foods. Very satisfying! I would highly recommend this market for a fun lunch experience!,Positive
500,I went there to buy the traditional custom to my family. I found a verity of products however they don't speak english and that make it hard to communicate. In addition to that they don't accept credit card only cash. There is no souvenir shop which I found it strange.  I have doubts about the food safety and hygiene. I don't encourage anyone to eat there.,Negative

700,"Stopped by to walk around and have lunch. The market does get crowded but that is just something you come to expect while traveling Asia. The food was excellent, and while some vendors try to get you to come to their stall, most are not pushy. We will go back the next time we are in Seoul.",Positive
701,"I lived in Seoul for many year, and working in Jongno. KUANGCHANG market is one of my favorate market with good taste and economic price. My favorate menu are Korean sausage in 60 old restaurant - Grandma Soondae, Kimbap and Bibibap and noodle in cart market. Could free park in weekend or easy to access from Jongno 5 ga subway station.",Positive
702,"When i entered the market, it smelled really bad ( a mix of different seafood and meat and who knows what else). And the variety of food is also not thaaat great.But here you can buy real authentic korean snacks (tokkpoki and sundae...), while other food-streets sometimes try to adjust to the tourists. And also the building itself is not that huge. So that could be an advantage if you don't have that much time. SInce the place is very crowded, eating there (standing and sometimes there is a chair) is not really comfortable. There are a few ""restaurants"" with seats and tables, but the waiter or ahjummas there are not really friendly...(maybe i was just unlucky). By the way the whole market is roofed, so you can even go there on a rainy day (like me).",Negative
703,Great food market nestled in the boughs of the market. Food really comes more to life.  Easy enough to get to this place it's along the subway. Coming over from the other side of the city is easy too either subway or bus. Little bit of walking but easy enough to make it there. Once your there head out to surrounding stores there are lots of places with energy.,Positive
704,"Cheap and tasty food everywhere. Simple food not the pretty dishes you fing in restaurants. For me, this was the must visit place in Seoul. So much delicious and strange foods to taste. Fantastic.",Positive
705,"Closed to metro station and a lot of native foods and fruits to buy. However, we didn't eat over there, it is extremely hot in Aug. The fruits are cheap and fresh. Nearby I would like to recommend a very traditional ginseng soup noodle, it is highly recommend to you guy if you visit Gwangjang and don't want eat inside.",Positive
706,We took a food tour with Janet and this is a wonderful market with such interesting history and the best mung bean pancakes ever. But with the temps near 100 degrees Fahrenheit and all the cooking going it took some of the fun out of it. I need to go here on a cold winter day!,Positive
707,"We come here on Sunday morning for a breakfast. Most of.the shop is closed on Sunday. I think Korea is a very relaxing city, they don't mind to earn less money, but they mind to lose family life. If you come here on Sunday, you can find some food unpalatable and unpleasant price.",Negative
708,"One of the most famous traditional markets in Seoul. It is quite an interesting experience to walk through the markets, lots of eateries in the open area selling deep fried green bean cake, kimbap, noodles and so on.

711,"Toooooo many things to try out here, our tummies weren't big enough to fit them all. We tried the kimbap, rice cakes and jokbal, served with some fish cake soup on the side. So yummy! Also had a serve of bibim naengmyeon (spicy cold noodles), our first time trying this and we fell in love with this dish immediately. We will be back soon for the bindaetteok (mung bean pancake), boribap (mixed rice) and yukhoe (seasoned raw beef)!",Positive
712,"Great to walk around, stroll around the local stores for souvenirs and kimchis! They sell kimchi per kilos. Foods are okay, nothing special and a tad overprice.",Positive
713,"Most of the stalls sold the same food - pancakes, dumplings, jap chae. You can also get live octopus here. There are seats at each stall but you can also get take away. It can get pretty hot in here as it's covered but the ventilation isn't great.  Definitely a great experience for first time Seoul visitors.",Negative
714,"Go there see real traditional market place, real local street food and maybe cheaper souvenirs. Its deserves a visit if you have time. Know that market is big so go to fabrics and food sectios",Neutral
715,Lots of nice food with reasonable price.  Most of the stall vendors able to converse in English or Mandarin.,Positive
716,We went there just to buy Korean Silk. There are many food stalls and shops selling all sort of textile.,Neutral
717,"This market sells a lot of food such as sundae, bintaedokk, tteokbokki and more. It's a traditional market and there are people who also sell ctraditional clothes in there.",Neutral
718,"If you want Korean street food, this is the place you'll find it. Things are overpriced almost by mandate and usually served for two or more so feel free to haggle if you're in the mood, especially if you're buying half portions (i.e. for one) or multiple foods from one vendor. You can buy things to go or just sit down and eat right there. The other offshoots are also interesting to explore for some of the wares they sell.",Positive
719,"real authentic Korean things to buy, such as tees or chains, or hanboks, or dresses. you can buy really good tea, from Jeju island as well.",Positive
720,"So many cloth and something culture of korean people ,The Gwangjing Market so big for local .I was travelling and buy some souvenir .",Neutral
721,"it's a massive Market sells lots of stuff, food is the most. the variety, taste, the colour, the ppl, you have to try it all. i only had few and was already full. dare to try the fresh octopus, if u like sashimi, then i bet u will like it.",Positive
722,"Huge traditional Korean market. I'll go back to try and eat that live octopus, I got scared the first time. While this is a busy market, it is relatively quiet and clean.",Positive
723,"Although this market has become very touristy and a little high-priced, it is still a great place to visit to see all the interesting foods that Korea has to offer. It will also make some squirm at the same time... not for the novice traveller!",Positive
724,"The place to go for some amazing street-style food.  Highly recommended: The mung bean pancaked. Sit yourself down at one of the tables in the center of the market. In no time you'll have one of the deep fried beauties in front of you. Best eaten with the vinegar and onion sauce for dipping and a delicious bowl of makgeolli, the korean rice wine! WARNING: The wine is quite sweet and masks the alcohol quite well, so pace yourself when drinking.",Positive
725,"I want there in the last few months and saw many chinese people on that street which was kind of noisy. The stuff they sold there was interesting but remember to bargain with the shop, you will get some surprise",Positive
726,"We went on a late Sunday morning so the food stalls were open but some stalls selling other stuff were not. Still there was plenty to see. Vendors selling their wares like souvenirs, fresh produce etc. The food stalls here sell more traditional food such as mung bean pancakes, octopus, dumplings, gimbap etc unlike those in Myeongdong. The food here is cheaper too. You order your food and sit right at the stalls to eat. The stalls at the junction seem to be more popular and crowded. It is quite warm. You can take pictures with the live octopus provided you pay for it and eat it. I would say you could spend 1 to 1.5 hrs wandering around. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.",Positive
727,"I went there for the greenbean pancake (bindetteok), rice cake, bibimbap and naengmyeon! I must recommend the naengmyeon in a air-conditioned stall at the corner of the long passage of the food stall, big portion and very nice elastic cold noodle!",Positive
728,"Bring Cash, and have fun. You can buy almost anything. I was a little suspicious of the designer items for sale everywhere. I don't know much about spotting fakes, so it's buy at your own risk. What I did buy was a traditional dress for my niece that is just beautiful. I also tried some of the street food. I couldn't tell you what I ate, but it was good.",Positive
729,"we were there on a thursday early evening and so the place not very crowded. besides souvenirs, there are food stalls, shoe shops, dry goods stalls, even hanbok shop. its interesting to see such a variety of stuff in 1 market. prices here are reasonable.",Positive
730,"Fun to walk through and experience the sights, smells, and sounds of this market. There is also a whole floor of fabrics (?2nd floor) if you're into that sort of thing. Main level has an assortment of cooked food vendors, fresh seafood, clothing, assorted souvenirs. I walked through at lunch time and many locals seemed to be enjoying their lunch right there. Nice experience.",Positive
731,This is a very huge and famous day market of Seoul. You can get souvenirs here too. We love the food here.,Positive
732,"The market is a great place to explore. We walked there for dinner. Many of the merchants in the market had already closed for the day, but the food stalls were buzzing with activity. Interesting food stalls featuring Korean food... however if you do not like Korean food, this might not be the place to try for dinner. However the varieties of kimchi, seafood and traditional Korean foods make for a very photogenic market. We tried dotorimuk (acorn jelly) salad and bindaetteok (mung bean fried pancakes). Delicious!",Positive
733,This is more a stop for Korean bites than shopping. Try out the local snacks like the Korean Spicy Rice Cake which is a common fare in almost every stall. Casual sitting here so dress light in Summer. There are still plenty of shops selling your daily wares and sometimes Korean souvenirs.,Neutral
734,I didn't buy anything from the market... But the small alleys close by were really cool. The market sells so many types of different items it's unbelievable. Definitely worth a see :),Positive
735,"We make it a must to visit Gwangjang Market every trip to Seoul. We love the buckwheat husk pillows and Korean blankets and would cart off several every time we come to Seoul.  There are so many small eateries/shops here that sell great food! My siblings aren't about to try the food from the stalls here, so we settle for the eateries/shops that sell food. How to find a good one? Look inside and see if there are many locals in there. Yup. These serve better food.  Incidentally, my sibling bought a dozen sets of chopsticks, spoons and metal bowls from here. Cheapest, compared to Daiso, Insadong etc. I bought lots of souvenirs here. Cheaper than Insadong and Myeongdong.  One drawback: avoid the toilets.",Positive
736,"i had some nice korean food here, like the traditional pancake 8delicious) and some other weird stuff. cheap eats and lots of flavours!",Positive
737,"This place is huge!!! And so clean to be a street market that it is not even real!. I have been in places like that in mainland China and there is nothing to compare, on that (and many others) regard.  This is a world in itself, self contained, I would say it comprised many blocks, everything that you want to see is there. I find it reasonably priced, a magic universe of food, ingredients, sewing notions (amazing, it is the sewer paradise), electronics, people offering any kind of services, even the ones that are not longer offered in the west. We have seen a guy squatting on the floor repairing an old iron, for example. It is also Fabric Wonderland, every type of fabric is offered there, plus very good clothing, very well priced. Everybody is friendly and no one hassles you, type of Chinese style. A great place, totally worthy.",Positive
738,Fun market in the fact that the almonds that we bought at the market were outstanding and seemed crunchy and really fresh (even though they were imported from CA)...? The upstairs Hanbok (traditional Korean dress) area had numerous stores (abt 100) to observe and take pics of.,Positive
739,"There are a lot of shop n food there, my friend told me to buy some ginseng there n I found out is really cheap there buy more get more discounts",Positive
740,"You will find this kind of market is everywhere in Seoul. But Gwangjang Market is worth to go as here is one-stop marketplace for everything you can put into your mouth. From the wetmarket, you can buy the seafood and have the restaurant there to cook for you. There are plenty of food stalls selling all kind of Korean delicacies, from ginseng soup to kimchi dumplings, korean pancake, bibimbab, and even the rice barley drinks. I give a 10/10 for this spot from the assessment of one who craves for foods in Seoul. The prices are also very competitive!",Positive
741,"It's smaller than I have expected. The food stalls are all selling similar stuff, crammed together, so the market gets very hot.",Neutral
742,"If you're in Korea, you need to try authentic market food and Gwangjung markets is the biggest. This market is famous for it's Potato Jeon which is a must try along with a bottle of Makeolli. Other dishes are not particularly unique to this market however I would try the raw beef (Yukhwe) which is the korean version of steak tartare. A great way to experience Korean culture and cuisine in a market setting which is very different to the restaurants.",Positive
743,"We went to the market to see more about traditional Korean food and I was confused a bit because they have so many stalls selling the same food at one of each alley. Too many vendors to be chosen and those ahjumas will keep calling you to eat at their place. This is one of the problem I see in South Korea that they really compete to each other with the same stuffs just to see which stall more popular by the crowd. We eat the traditional Bimbimbap, tteokbokki, hand cut noodles and dumpling and it was pretty good. They rarely speak English but they speak Chinese due to the growing of Chinese tourists to South Korea but most of them have English menu so you can just ask to see the price before you eat at their stall. The price range on every stall pretty much the same and eating at the market doesn't mean cheap price (KRW 5000-10,000) depends on what you eat. Anyway it always a good experience to see a traditional market in every country to feel more about the culture and their food and I feel that Korea has the best street food so far.",Positive
744,Lots of street food vendors and you can find a lot of seafood related dishes around if you like and is not allergic to seafood.,Positive
745,Lots of beautiful and colourful hanboks. The food were cheap and delicous as well. I really enjoyed the rice cake soup and pancakes.,Positive
746,"Despite having been to Seoul several times, I've never ventured beyond the Namdaemun traditional market. This place is not hard to find and it's pretty clean and sheltered. The most famous item in this market has to be the bintaettok (mung bean pancakes). Many people raved about them but I frankly did not enjoy them that much. It's an acquired taste, I think. There are many food stalls to sample local food and you can even buy banchan (small side dishes) back to your hotel to slowly savour them. I didn't see much for shopping though there are so many shops selling pretty hanboks. I'm glad I came for the experience but I'm not sure if I will be back a second time.",Positive
747,"몇몇 음식점 특히 마약김밥 및 빈대떡, 순대 등이 유명하여 굳이 줄 서서 먹었으나 너무너무 실망했다. 마약 김밥 같은 경우는 비싸지 않지만 줄 서서 먹을 것도 아니고 이름 하나 잘 지어서 (""마약""이란 이름이 우리나라 사람에게 흥미로와서) 대박 난 듯... 너무 상업화 되었고 교통이 편한 편도 아니니 굳이 갈 필요는 없을 듯. 차라리 망원 시장이나 경복궁역 근처의 통인 시장이 더 좋을 듯 하다.  I queued long time to have those so called ""the must eat"" things among locals such as Mayak Kimbab (drug kimbab) ,Bin-dae-dduck (korean pan cake) and Squid Soon-dae (korean sort of black pudding or sausage) but they were all not that worthy. I recommend other markets like Mangone market or Tong-In market nearby Kyung Bok palace.",Negative
748,A large selection of food vendors throughout as well as non-food things on offer. We visited at sunset/evening on a Monday and it was bustling with energy.,Positive
749,"Look more like a market selling cooked food and street food. If you like these food, you will love this market. Vendors do not speak English. But most of the food is 1000 won or 2000 won. So they will gesture by showing 1 finger or 2 fingers.",Positive
750,"Love going to Gwangjang market for breakfast, you will be spoilt for choices. Pumpkin and red bean porridge, kimchi pancake, barley rice, spicy rice cake and so much more your tummy will be more than satisfied. Go to the alleys to look at the huge range of kimchi and other raw foods available for sale.",Positive
751,"A great place to buy souvenirs and taste local food. You'll see it will get crowded once local people have done working and eat at those local food vendors. Recommend to stop by at one of those food vendors. There's a roof over the market, so rain won't spoil the mood.",Positive
752,"very close to metro station!! Compared to many traditional markets, this market is surprisingly clean. You can find a lot famous and traditional food there. Good for breakfast or lunch. Lots of vendors can also speak Chinese, but take it easy, they are friendly, and body language works anytime! Besides, you can also find some small stuffs as gifts, such as Hanbok book marks and so on. 比想像中乾淨很多, 大多的攤飯也會說中文, 這裡你可以嘗到各種美食, 當成早餐或午餐都很棒, 此市場離地鐵站非常近! 在這裡不只食物, 還可以買到一些小紀念品或者伴手禮",Positive
753,"Not a big scale market, but you will be amazed by the number of watering foods they served. Kimchi, seaweed, noodles, Korean pancake etc. Highly recommended place to visit if you're Korean food lover! They serve mainly traditional preserved Korean foods, if you're opting something like barbecue or fried chicken, this is not the place.",Positive
754,"For local goodies and food like seaweed, chocolates, almonds, ginseng, blood sausage, dumplings, fish cake, gimbap, tokkboki, etc. Gwangjang market is the place to visit.  Food and goodies here are way cheaper compare to other market they range from 500-4000 won. You can also haggle with peddlers. Expect that the place is crowded with locals.  A must place to visit :)",Positive
755,"If you have a wild streak and you are very adventurous, you can try authentic Korean cuisine. There is dog meat and dog meat soups available as well as live octopus to enjoy if you can. The sights and the smells are equally worth experiencing.",Positive
756,This is a very traditional market known for its variety of food. There are also different sections selling fabrics and other stuffs. But what stand out is the food section that sells all kind of Korean food. Come here for your meals and you won't be disappointed. They are cheap and good and a cultural experience too!,Positive
757,"it can be a little difficult to find the place, but once you are there, you must eat there! try their barley bibimbap, mayak kimbap, mungbean pancake & red bean porridge. its really good! it is a traditional market, and they sell all sorts of things. seafood to hanbok. it's a must go!",Positive
758,"Gwangjang Market, previously Dongdaemun Market, is a traditional street market in Jongno-gu, Seoul. The market is one of the oldest and largest traditional markets in South Korea, with more than 5000 shops and 20,000 employees in an area of 42,000 square metres. Approximately 65,000 people visit the market each day. Get your ginseng here, get your breakfast here, various of home made food. The best place to be!",Positive
759,"Easy to go there and lots of delicious foods and traditional foods, you must go there for try it. And have too many stalls on the market.",Positive
760,"If you want to see the real Seoul, this is the place. The stalls are amazing, the variety immense, and the senses are overwhelmed by the sheer buzz of the place. Well worth a visit.",Positive
761,"Whilst in Korea, I came to really like their traditional markets, it just reminds me so much of things when I was abit younger. And Gwangjang Market is no exception. It’s huge and you can find lots of things here that you typically wouldn’t find outside of a traditional market. So, fabrics, dried food produce etc. Fruit here is fresh and pretty affordable and there are also lots of food stalls in the center of the area. We tried Bindaetteok, which is a kind of pancake only found in that area of Seoul (that’s what I heard). However, it gets super crowded by 11am, so if you are looking to browse around at a more leisurely pace, do arrive earlier. A lot of the stalls open really early (earliest opening 830am).",Positive
762,"Stayed in Seoul for a few days, and found this market so satisfying for healthy, cheap dinners. Our favourite was the handmade noodle stand near to one of the entrances - so fresh!! And the salad/rice bowls were at other stalls near by were also very nice. Meals worked out to be about $5 Aud from memory and were sooo filling. ...always finished off our night at the markets with a donut mmm!",Positive
763,"a lot of food variety, must come and try. also selling many other stuff but we did not look into as we can't speak korean",Neutral
764,"You don't even have to come to shop if you don't want to. What this place should be known for is the street food. Open early afternoon to late at night, there are always people here eating and shopping. Truly the best place in Seoul to get a taste of all of the street food under a roofed place. You'll be able to find local favorites such as mandoo, ramyun, pancakes, and sausages here all in one convenient place.",Positive
765,"The market covers almost everything you would want to experience in one place in one day! There are rows of kim chi, preserved veg, dried fish etc etc There are stalls selling bed linens table cloths etc etc There are stalls selling clothes, souvenirs ""silk"" pouches bags etc many sit down stalls for freshly ground mung-bean pancakes, stewed pork, intestines and offals, pumpkin/redbean/abalone congee. best of all, the dumplings and hand-made noodles The best time to try street/stall food is 11am to 2pm, just pick you little space, squeeze between other diners and sit on the heated wooden stools and enjoy! hot tea is usually self serviced at the stall Watch out for the little ladies who balance two or three trays of food (small dishes of kim chi included) on their heads to be delivered to a hungry stall owner who is stuck, sometimes alone, manning their little stalls making a living. This is what travelling is about! mix and eat with the locals side by side, elbow to elbow, and remember the experience, I still miss it.",Positive
766,"We arrived around 4pm, some ladies we setting up food stalls, so maybe this can be a different experience later in the day. However, the shops are really one dimensional, bolt after bolt of cloth and pre-made clothing. Worth a miss in my book.",Positive
767,A great selection of foods here. Make sure to try their mung bean pancake and also the bibimbap. Price wise is reasonable,Positive
768,"While living in Seoul for a year I spent my time looking for the best places to eat. This place by far exceeded my expectations. Lots of little food stalls and ajummas and ajashis wandering around. Most of the time I'd head there by myself about mid day to sit and have a snack. I'd always end up sitting next to an old man eating japchae, sundae, and boribap with mini kimbap while sharing makgeolli and soju together while I'd throw the few random korean I knew into the mix and he'd just chat away. It was wonderful! There's something so wonderful about sharing food yet being lost in translation. Lived there 2011-2012",Positive
769,"This is a traditional market in Seoul. If you plan to go this place I recommend that you also can go to Dongdaemun, these two place are really close. You also can have breakfast in this market and get some tradition stuff, everything is very cheap. Anyway we had a great time in this market.",Positive
770,"I love this place!! It's bustling with people and food!!! Exotic food that I did not want to try ^^!  The market are lined with souvenirs, clothes and bedding stores. They are cheaper here compared to all the other tourists places I have been to.  There are aunts with their food ready to be cooked in the middle of the street and they are all so fresh and good!  For adventurous, you can try the octopus sashimi and the sea squirt. For the non adventurous, like me, it's safe to try the pancake, oden, mandoo and kimbab.",Positive
771,"We stayed in Dongdaemun. The first time, we walked to the market. It took us about 45 minutes but then we stopped at various stalls/shops along the way. The second time, we took the metro and the market was less than a 5 minute walk from the station.  We loved the mung bean pancakes and the mayak kimbap. We could have eaten them everyday...",Positive
772,Walking through this market is a treat for the eyes. Sitting at the tables and eating with the locals is a treat for your stomach and your mind. Everyone is friendly and will help you get what you want. Wonderful food. Never a bad dish.,Positive
773,LOVE LOVE LOVE! Being Korean and returning to my home country- a visit to this place fills my soul in a way that is beyond words. The dduk-bbok-ggi! The soon-dae! The o-deng! Everything there screams KOREA to me. Not to be missed.,Positive
774,"Easily accessible as it's not far from the Seoul Canal walk, you can pop up from approx 1/3rd the way along and visit.  Tons of stalls selling a variety of typical korean street food and even if not planning to buy anything worth going just for the atmosphere. Truly only described as bustling.",Positive
775,"We went for the food reviews online. It was Sunday and a lot of the shops were closed, but the food was definitely an adventure. It was very crowded, and if you have picky eaters they will not enjoy this!",Positive
776,"This is located near Insadong and both places can be visited on the same morning. Stopped by here to have some kimchi pancakes as well as steamed crab. Food stalls abound on the ground floor, as well as bed linens, bolsters and Korean souvenirs.  In the huge covered area, on the second floor, you can find lots of clothes stalls, with apparel that are mostly made in China. It's more expensive than what I have seen for the same stuff in Shanghai, but there is great variety here, from jeans to blouses and jackets. Some of the staircases can be steep and slippery, especially if they are wet, so be careful.  The third floor is devoted to hanbuk shops, selling the traditional Korean dress, for both children and adults. Do haggle though if you are interested in getting one.  Also bought a box of lovely strawberries from an eldery lady on the ground floor. Do also check out the toy store in one corner - it was selling a light sabre for S$55 and stormtroppers for S$150 - as well as the gardening and fish stalls near the outside. There are also a row of pharmacies at the far end.",Positive
777,"The food market is a must do. The layout is like an octopus with little streets extending out of a centre point all under one roof. It feels like each little street specializes in certain kinds of food, too many to mention, look out for the suggestions in the various Seoul must eat lists online.",Positive
778,"This place was huge, only downfall it seemed most of the vendors had the exact same stuff in each store. Its definitely an experience though!",Positive
779,"This is a place I wanted to go so bad, after watching a video blog from Mark Wiens on YouTube, and it did not disappoint. I had kimbap, korean pancakes and dumpling soup there spending around 10000 KRW (10 USD) in total, which was great for a lunch. Lots of food stalls where you can find a variety of Korean food, as you may be able to find some Korean souvenirs to buy. Conveniently located near the metro station, which is a plus.  If you would like to experience a traditional Korea shopping and food experience, definitely go here!",Positive
780,"This place near Dongdaemun area, which is many grocery for stationery, fashion, shoes, etc. I take lunch here for some Korean ""snack"" but it is quite cheap and make me full. But many others stall selling foods like noodle seafood, etc",Positive
781,"There is nothing not to like here! This Korean grand marche is simply mesmerizing to me. From the freshly made food to the heated seating in the middle of the winter, to the abundant produce, seafood on display, the alleys filled with Korean traditional apparels, and so much more, Gwangjang holds a special appeal to me on this and many more trips to Seoul. Love it there!",Positive
782,"It is good to walk around the market and look at their culture. You can buy some food to try as well, but it is a little over priced to me, overall is okay, the market is very clean.",Positive
783,"i love love the food here. been here twice for the lunch/dinner just cause i couldn't get enough of the mayak kimbap! this place is pretty big they have food section, clothes, accessories etc. totally worth a visit",Positive
784,Nice for a local experience. Lotsa traditional local food to try. Also can find traditional Korean clothing here. Best for travelers who would like to try the local food! Go with empty tummy!,Positive
785,what i really love about this place is their food. you will be able to eat different types of authentic Korean food.  Live Octopus? you can eat them here. I haven't tried i am not that adventurous yet. but they said it's good with beer,Positive
786,"The market is full of eateries, stalks, small restaurants, grocery shops, clothes shops and many more. Prepare to spend half a day there to experience the local delicacies. Gwangjang Market is very popular among locals and foreigners.",Positive
787,This place is just a huge old market in Seoul. Street food here isn't great and things aren't hygiene. Honestly there isn't much to look at or to do. I only go if I want to look for vintage/ old/ cheap clothes on the second floor. Anyway I don't recommend this place for tourists!,Negative
788,"we are a little dissappointed with the food stalls in this market. not that sanitary and delicious and very very crowded. however, there are lots of dried goods and clothing for sale.",Positive
789,"This market is not as I expected since the food section is only for a small section in the market (from Exit 2 of Subway). The rest is for hanbok tailors or fabrics. The food section is quite crowded with some similar cuisine. However, for travelers, it is a good place to explore Korean culture through cuisine. The price (for sure) is for tourists. Haha.",Positive
790,"Still a bustling local market, this is a great place to try street food (if you can find a seat among the locals and if you can figure out how to order!). Food prices are cheap and it’s a great place to soak in local culture. One tip: remember what gate/door you entered by (esp if you’re meeting a group or guide later). It’s easy to lose your orientation. Also, try the bindaetteok (mung bean pancake), it was our fav and we wish we had got more instead of sharing one.",Positive
791,"We came here twice during our 5 day trip to Seoul and loved it. The atmosphere is great ! It's always super busy and you can barely move but it just adds to the experience. I recommend come on an empty stomach and try lots from the different stalls. We tried the bindaetteok (fried mung bean pancake), ddeokbokki, kimbap, kimchi mandu and a selection of jeon. Everything was great, but I would mention that if you're not a huge meat eater, the smell of the blood sausage and pig trotters can be very strong. Highly recommend to come here, especially if you're on a budget.",Positive
792,"Visited this place cause lots of variety show goes to their traditional market. Lots of eatery,counted as big compare to other market. Easily located outside the metro exit.",Positive
793,Came across a few friendly seller & love the foods there. Very near to subway station. It's a local morning market with all kind of foods,Positive
794,"The market is buzzing with activity, very colourful shops and stalls and had some great street food. lots of locals at the market - so you have a great vibe, not just a tourist site",Positive
795,"The stretch from the subway station to the Gwangjang market 광장시장, is lined with stores such as hanbok tailors (not the typical shopping stretch for tourists). The market has the grocery part as well as the food street part. there is a nice Samgyetang shop which I didn't try - I shall try the next time I go to Korea. I took away 김밥 kimbap for dinner, and it was surprisingly very oily.. it cost only SGD 3 for 2 rolls.",Positive
796,"Gwangjang market is a fun place to shop and eat. Though we reached there and the stores we closing, we found really pretty hanbok accessories and souvenirs and loved them so much. It is a popular place to make hanbok and every piece looked so pretty! The food section closes much later and you can basically find everything. The kimbap was addictive and tastes different from the ones sold outside. The seaweed that wraps the kimbap was more crispy and tasty. I would go back again. Oh the underground mall at the subway station has more hanbok accessories and I found them a bit cheaper there. Walk around first!",Positive
797,"Gwangjang Market was really fun. There were a lot of street food, and quite a lot of people there so it was really lively! If you want to get some good Korean food, this is the place to come. The food stalls sell bindaetteok (Apparently, a store called Soon E Nae , 순이네 is popular among the locals), mayak kimbab (Translation: drug Kimbab, because it's addicting), sannakji (cut octopus legs that is still 'alive' while you eat them. My mom and I ate all of them, but the 3 people from China sitting beside us, didn't even eat one, they just kept looking in wonder), Ddeokbokki and more! They also sell banchan, (Korean dishes eaten with rice) so if you want to eat something that Koreans would usually eat, you could buy some, cook or buy some rice and eat it where you're staying at. And last but not least, I got to see some amazing hanbok here. I'm a fan of Hanbok, so it was really nice seeing all the hanbok stores.",Positive
798,This market is great for shopping and dining. Many traditional food stalls around the area. You also can buy fresh vegetable & fruits here. Don't forget to check the Hanbok & souvenir shops.,Positive
799,"Used to love this place when I visited in 2012. Then, it was less crowded and had more locals shopping around. It was more spacious and unexpensive.  Back here in 2015, and the market is packed to the brim with tourists and Koreans (60-40), pushing each other to get around the food section of the market. And somehow the food has become so expensive too, 3000w for 1 odeng, which is ridiculous since elsewhere it is possible to get an odeng for 500w.  Only come here to experience the market feel, and try some food if you want. But bear in mind it's a tourist rate :(",Negative
800,"As all Korean markets, the centre of this market is also covered in food stalls. Beckoning store owners fighting for your business show case all sorts of traditional Korean pancakes, ricecakes, fish sticks, fried foods and...this is also the place to try Korea's famous raw beef - Ukhye/Yukhoe/Yukke (however it is romanised).  Secretly tucked away are a couple of small stores that sell souvenirs here as well and this is where I always come to buy my souvenirs as they're slightly cheaper than Insadong. Don't expect to find everything you want here though due to its smallness.",Neutral
801,"I prefer traditional market as there is so much to see, eat and buy!! of course there is difficulty as some speak very little English but still it was a pleasant experience.",Positive
802,"For shopping hit here, you can get the best deals, and they have certain nice tissus, traditional Clothes, and products , near by the Metro station",Positive
803,"Whilst everyone flocks to Namdaemun, I steer my visitors to Gwangjang. It's a more manageable size and can easily be accessed by a stroll along the Chonggyecheon Stream. The second floor is THE place to buy and get hanbok (traditional Korean dress). Seoulites of a certain caliber come here just for this. It is a photographers dream up there and a foodies paradise in the central circus of the covered market.",Positive
804,"Lots of hot food, great for a cold day, just sit down on a warm bench seat and tell them what you want. This market is used a lot by locals and has fresh produce such as Meats Fish Fruit and Vegetables as well as clothing and fabrics",Positive
805,"I like this market for its diversified products from expensive to low range prices. The local foods are alike their countryside dishes so good, so moderate prices. Souvenirs are the best, bargain for wholesale price. Cameras, scarves, clothings you name it. Stop by a Starbuck for beverages, sweets same as home. You can spend 3-4 hours wandering from shopping to window shopping is an enjoyable time. I love this market.",Positive
806,"On my last day, my local friend and I spent the day wandering around various markets. One of the most well-known is Gwangjang Market in Jongno-gu. The market is covered and is packed to the rooftops with stalls selling everything you can imagine. The highlight are the food stalls, with amazing smells overwhelming the senses. We stopped at a family stall and planted our bums on wonderfully heated seats. We were treated to simply delicious pancakes, vegetable and meat with a pickle of diced white onions in soy sauce to cut through the pancakes - heavenly!",Positive
807,"Its a good idea to visit this place early in the morning. Then you can see and experience the locals shopping for groceries and having breakfast.  There are loads of stores selling vegetables, meat, seafood and of course, kimchi. Also there were stores selling clothing, textiles, housewares, etc.  We ate the pancakes and also tried a dumpling noodles soup for breakfast. It was decent and filling.",Positive
808,"We arrived at Gwangjang Market late evening; our main purpose is to try some of the popular local food (bibimbap, pancake, gimbak, etc). The place was crowded with diners sitting in front of the many stalls. Some of the popular stalls had long queues, probably the food taste better. We did not have much time therefore we scout around for those stalls that we are comfortable. The pancake and gimbak was ok and reasonable priced.  I would recommend this place only to food lovers who like to explore the locals way of life and try the varieties of local food. You will also need to close an eye on the hygiene here, which is not of the highest standard.",Positive
809,"For those who look for a different experience other than shopping for cosmetics and fashion items in Seoul, drop by at Grmwangjang Market! Have a taste of a famous mung bean pancake and many other delicacies in very reasonabke prices.",Negative
810,This place is always busy. There's lots of local food to share with others. Lots of cute cultural gifts and hanboks. I really wish I bought a hanbok here (because it's custom made and ready to buy) but I didn't have enough time.  Recommend to go here to try local snacks with friends.,Positive
811,This is one of the great places to explore and experience the locals' way of life. There is a whole section selling cooked food that is cheap and delicious. Try the famous mung bean pancakes!,Positive
812,"A very interesting place. I came on a public holiday (wrong day!!), it was super duper crowded. so definitely avoid public holidays. It was recommended by my Korean teacher because I said I want to eat traditional Korean food. No pasta, no bread, no pizza please. So she recommended this Gwangjang Sijang.  Easy to access by public transport. I took a subway from Gwanghwamun. I think it was about a few stops away.  I was going to eat sundaegukbap but I just remember that it's pork and my friends were Muslim. So we settled for some jeons (pancake). Most food are pork-based, or soups, very very traditional and a few look homemade to me. Love them to death. Bring a Korean friend! I spoke functional Korean languange for the purpose of the trip. But ahjumma and ahjussi (aunties and uncles) there can be hard to understand and they do not speak English, and you might want to know what's in what food.",Positive
813,If you are looking for food. Then please do not go there. The hygiene and eateries and food are below standard. A very local place for the locals.  if you are looking for a nice photography place where you can capture the local daily scene. Yes this is one of the place as the market has a long history.  But remember which entrance you come from and which you are leaving towards. It is quite a big place and each way looks the same and you may get lost.,Positive
814,"Its a bustling market with plenty of food stalls selling almost the same stuff - pancake pan fried. I like the late afternoons when there are very friendly elderly locals drinking and eating and if you dare and care, you could join in, buy a bottle of soju, order some food and sit on the communal long bench.",Positive
815,Love this market. To know the culture of the country. Many local stuff sold at this market. A lot of local food stores that you can just seat down and eat. The price is reasonable.,Positive
816,"Personally I am not too interested in all of the fabrics and hanboks that are for sale here but once I reached the food alley I was in heaven! Never experienced anything like this - old Korean ladies in their small stalls cooking ddeokbokki, jeon etc, always having about 4 sitting spaces crammed around their little 'station'... we went for a jeon selection and it was a great experience!",Positive

822,"Such an interesting place just to wander around, even if the goods aren't what you'd want to buy. You can see all the traditional Korean clothes, fabrics and sundry clothing, household goods, some souvenirs and lots of street foods. There is a whole aisle of small restaurants and many even have an english menu. They looked pretty clean and I sat down at a place with huge stack of mandu (dumplings) and had a delicious warming dumpling soup, Even the bench was heated that I sat on and you got free tea that you helped yourself from a bottle, with your meal-all for W5500. A fun experience. The market is a short walk along Chongycheon stream from Dongdaemun.",Positive

Many humble street food stalls over here and they run till late. There's a lane for seafood where you can find ganjang gejang (raw crabs) to haemultang (assorted seafood stew), a lane for Korean pancakes, a lane for raw beef, a lane for dumplings and many many more. Gwangjang market is certainly not to be missed while in Seoul.",Positive

I didn't encounter tourist hoard so if the local is your thing you'll love it. It's where the local elderly go to shop. Where if your staying for longer than a week Seoul, you can get hanbok made for cheap. It's an easy walk to Dongdaemun as well.",Positive
834,"Many Local food that you can try, the food that you can see in K-series included. also have many local goods. good quality seaweed.nuts.",Positive

837,"Yes, this is the market place crowded with locals and tourists. If you're afraid of language bearer, not to worry, most of the stalls do have helpers that speak Mandarin or simple English. You may not want to miss the various hot-pot offering in the tiny restaurants too. I prefer to go there near noon when the shops there are opened and you will get a lot of stuff there at good price. The kimchi stores there also offer air-tight packing for your shipment too.",Positive
838,"This market is selling authentic local food by the locals. You sit right in front of the stalls to consume your purchases. Great experience.  There are also stores that sell clothes, kitchen needs, raw food, snacks etc.",Positive
839,"LOVED the markets in Seoul, which operate nearly 24 hours a day and are equally busy at all hours. We spent much of our time in the food area, observing and eating. Took some courage, but on a recommendation we ate and loved the mung bean pancakes being fried fresh at many stalls, and drank local beer along with the super hot cakes. Ate fresh dates and explored the many stalls selling everything from traditionally embroidered clothing to sundries and souvenirs. This is clearly a place the locals use.  We were super impressed by how friendly and open people were. They were very happy to share their country (and their table) with foreigners and seemed amused by our photo taking and deer in the headlights look!",Positive
840,"Amazing shopping, so many stalls of everything. Good souvenir place. Eat dumpling soup next to all the locals in between the stalls of clothes etc. It was a huge, giant, bowl of noodle and dumpling soup for 5000w. Noodles are made right in front of you! Delicious, extremely authentic experience.",Positive
841,"Well,all I can say is that food everywhere.from tteokpokki,bingsoo,bindaetteok,pajeon,naengmyeon,etc etc.it's not as crowded as namdaemun market.i prefer gwangjang market for sure..👍",Neutral
842,Many wonderful smells surrounding the food booths. Too bad we just had lunch. The streets were packed and everyone enjoyed their fast and inexpensive food.,Positive
843,"The atmosphere of this local market was awesome. The food were very tasty and affordable. We ate Kimbaps, Jap chae, red bean/pumpkin porridges, sashimi, and topokki in there. We just couldn't stop eating in this place. There were so many foods that we still wanted to eat, but we didn't have enough room in our stomachs to the food.  We bought some marinated crabs and octopus in Gwangjang market. Those Ajummas who sold the marinated food were so funny and nice. They even gave us a bag of other marinated seafoods for free b/c they knew that we haven't tried those marinated seafoods before. (In Gwangjang, those Ajummas will give you try the food before you buy. They will also give you free hot tea and yogurt drinks while you are picking the food --> awesome customer service)  Besides food, we also found Korean traditional clothing, bedding stuffs and accessories in the market. It was so easy to find some good traditional stuffs for souvenirs.  My friends and I love Gwangjang Market so much! We definitely will go there again! :)",Positive
844,"Anneyonghaseyo..hi. 1st time here. Walking through the shops on the streets. Lots of clothing shops and food stalls. My wife bought some silk scarf (10 pieces) as souvenirs for her friends the price are 5000 krw per pieces and got 2 pieces free from the seller. Thanks! Talking about the pasar Maran. Maybe only readers from Pahang Malaysia can understand of what I'm referring to. Kind of unbelievable on some area I can see the pasar maran here. Old folks are sitting on the ground, selling their agro stuffs like vegetables, herbs and beans etc. Reminding me at home.",Positive
845,This is a wonderful place to go IF - you are adventurous -you are with someone who speaks Korean or knows Korean food OTHERWISE this will be overwhelming. However it is worth it!!! There is tons of shopping but I would good for all the little stalls of food. There are tons.Find a seat at a table that looks good and order or just point to what you want. This is the perfect way to try tons and tons of different Korean foods from dumplings to pancakes to seafood to pigs feet. If you love Bizarre Foods or Anthony Bourdain....this is your kind of place.,Positive
846,This market was suggested by our hotel reception desk as we wanted to see some traditional shopping… this place is good for people who are looking to shop in bulk for business… mind blowing variety and stuff… you also tantalize your taste buds with local delicacy. If you have time do visit!,Positive
847,"We went there mainly for dinner and enjoyed it tremendously.  We had mung bean pancake, pork pancake, fish cake, sundae (AWESOME! -aka blood sausage but subject to individual taste)  rice cake (ok, the market's one was a bit too chunky for our liking.  Gimbap (found it so so -, not too sure what the hype is about on people's blogs though)  It was nice seating at the stalls and experiencing the market ambiance.",Positive
848,"First visit was little bit confused, but the second one with Korean frind was amazing. He took us for some Korean food. We ate a lot. We loved topoki with meat. It is relatively cheap for such a big portions. Lots of Koreans go there even with whole families. You just sit there on a banch and eatiing a food. Very different experience than restaurants.",Positive
849,"Table after table after table of people sitting around big woks of cooking, some recognizable some not, food. Food being dished out and money being exchanged depending on the dish served. Seas of people coming and going. All very interesting and entertaining. At the other end are clothing shops. This is different than other markets. Authentic. Go!",Positive
850,"For some reason, the name of this market (along with a couple of other sights) is alternately spelled with a G or a K. On my map it was spelled with a K and the sign over the market itself was spelled “Kwang Jang Market”. It caused me a little confusion, so I thought I’d just pass that info on.  The market itself is magical. I’ve been to a lot of food markets over the years and this one is definitely up there in terms of intensity as far as your senses are concerned.  Assuming you’re traveling during the shoulder seasons (Spring, Fall), the time to catch this market at its peak is just after the sun sets and the store/street lights begin to come on. Just walk right in and get sucked into the swarm of humanity. It’s a complete sensory overload and as you approach the nexus of the rows of food stalls, you’ll find it difficult to remain stationary. The human tides pulsing all around you will push you in one direction after another. No photograph could possibly do it justice; I ended up having to video-tape it in order to best capture it.  This is one of a few instances where you will genuinely lament that you don’t have a Korean friend or travel mate who knows how to grab a seat, knows what the food is and how to order it (unless you know Korean, you’ll be reduced to pointing and praying for the most part), what sauce you should dip what food into, figuring out the cost, etc.  I’ve rated it excellent because not only will you get a good, genuine Korean meal sitting alongside them, you’ll also get a sensory rush that will stay with you long after you’ve come home, but most importantly, you’ll get a glimpse into the very essence of Koreans and their relationship with food. Outside of being invited into the home of someone hosting a family get together, this is the closest you’ll ever get to a candid portrait of Koreans as their omnivorous selves.  There are assorted shops selling various items along the periphery, but they’ll be little more than background scenery if you come at the right time.",Positive
851,"Came here for late night eats with my friends. We had the crispy bindaetteok pancakes, soju and makkoli. They also sold bite sized gimbap and beef tartare.",Positive
852,"A must see and do attraction in Seoul. A traditional market and a food heaven for the foodies. Also, the best place to find hanbok or souvenirs that may be different from the ones you find in Insadong. Tips: Make sure to come in an empty stomach. Plenty of delicious food, and very authentic. Don't forget to try bindaettoek, the specialty It's probably better to bring a korean friend that can explain the different food",Positive
853,"You can a good variety of local food and snacks in this very well organised market. Stalls selling similar type of food would be clustered together, but the hawkers were very well mannered and we didn't experience any touting or hustling. We stall-hopped to try different food and were very curious, sometimes at a lost to how or what to order. But the owners or local patrons would gladly come to our help, and even taught us how to best enjoy the sashimi that we ordered. Walk around to find some souvenir before going home. A very enjoyable experience on the whole but read up on the opening hours/days before going!",Positive
854,"The place is chaotic, small, and it is difficult to find someone who speaks the language, but it is coolcoolcoolcoolcoolcoolcoolcoolcopiculturecult",Negative
855,"I gave this an excellent review because of the convenient location and I enjoyed the food but its not for people who dislike smelly local markets and unhygienic conditions. I love the vibe of the place as the place is abuzz with activity and colorful. You are spoilt for choice of dumplings, korean pancakes and seaweed rolls, but always ask the price and contents of these foods before buying because the fillings vary slightly from stall to stall. Look out for those that have proudly put up photos of their food/stalls being covered in local variety/TV shows as they are likely to be better than others, if you cannot decide which ones to buy from. The seasoned seaweed/laver/kelp snacks that come in packs of up to 16 individual packets are reasonably good here: you can bargain for lower price if you buy in bulk (e.g. between 5,000 to 8,000 won instead of 6,000 to 10,000 won).",Positive
856,Visited this market at night time. Plenty of foods and with mostly all the same food on most stalls. There are quite a few shops selling dried seaweed snacks and price can bargain....,Neutral
857,"This market is so big, it could take a whole day to see everything. There's clothing, beautiful local Korean apparel for children and adults, shoes, fabric,etc. and best of all, FOOD! This is were you can taste everything Korean, from dumplings, seafood, noodles, all kinds of Korean delicacies. There are stalls with stools where you can sit and order whatever food the stall is selling. Lots of locals and tourists come here to shop and eat. This place is a ""must see"".",Positive
858,"This is a must see for a visit to Seoul. There is so much to see and taste! Be it food, buttons, clothing, fabric...it is all here...in spades!!! A stunning place to wander and soak it all in!",Positive
859,Good place to experience the local delicacies and shopping for Korean traditional product. A little bit crowded place with Korean people. Language could be a problem as no clear sign or english speaking hawker. Interesting place to visit to see the daily life of Korean people.,Positive
860,OMG be prepared.....This market is unbelievable we stopped by several stalls to experience the local eats..DELICIOUS!!.. Be prepared for crowds and heat and take in the local vibe. A must see.,Positive
861,"Excellent, inexpensive street food that goes very well with beer! Could be improved with more variety.",Positive
862,"Very very hot inside during summer. Food are very cheap, but not as tasty as other reviews or bloggers said.",Neutral
863,"Even if you don't buy anything, it's such a fun & huge place to walk around just looking at all the fabrics, lacquerware & food. I've been to lots of markets throughout Asia & this was probably the cleanest well laid out one. They often feel a little unsafe & cramped but Gwangjang Market is terrific. Prices were good too & they have people in red shirts on that help you with information about the market if you get overwhelmed with options.",Positive
864,You can smell and taste the local foods in here. The vendor in this market are friendly and nice to talk to,Positive
865,"If you like street food, you should definitely come to this market. you can even eat raw octopus there.",Positive
866,"So many stuff here , decent price, go there after city hall. Some wholesale hair stuff here, such as traditional Korean dress, korean interesting food.",Positive
867,"if you want a WIDE variety of street food type options and want to eat local then this place is for you, but if you are looking for tourist style souvenirs then you are better off at namadaemun. gwangjang is not a 'must do' in my opinion but if you have time and are willing to experiment with food then check it out. it's a massive complex so you'll need to spend some time here",Positive
868,"This is definitely a paradise for Korean food lover! This market is huge and you can find everything here. The hawkers are friendly and able to converse in simple English. Lastly, strongly recommend to try bindaetteok! Don't miss it when you visit Seoul.",Positive
869,There are a lot of korean traditional foods in gwangjang market and it's cheaper.. Must came with an empty stomach.. I love the bindaeteok so much.. Masisoyoo..,Positive
870,"This market is filled with food stalls, restaurants, fabric stores, some seafood stalls, etc. The main attraction for me is the abundance of local dishes. Stalls are set up at the same area usually will sell very similar dishes-which makes it hard to decide which one to go for. You will be spoilt for choice-kimbap, pigs trotter, soybean pancake (must try), raw beef, dumplings, bibimbap, glass noodle and many more. There are at least two hundred food joints. If only i have more space in my stomach to savour the yummy food. The market is pretty clean and easy to get to via subway.",Positive
871,"Excellent place to go eating ""local style"". Try the bindaettok (mung-bean patty), mandu (dumplings) or jeon (different pancakes). Go to the yukhwe-street for the raw beef sashimi, it is excellent! During weekends quite crowded, but still worth to try. Very Korean experience.",Positive
872,"This is a great place to view all the great food that Seoul has to offer. It is usually really busy and you can find fresh food, prepared food, clothes and souveniors under the roof. Haven't had a bad meal there yet.",Positive
873,"This market is one of the oldest markets in Seoul. I purchased traditional Korean style items with saekdong design (rainbow style) items and cake baking & chocolate making mould, which can be used for soap mould. Very cute! A lot of colourful fabric items as well!",Positive
874,"I went with some friends on Friday night, specifically for dinner. We arrived about 10:30 p.m. and only a few food stalls were open. The women who worked at the stall were friendly and not too pushy. We ate mixed jeon, sundae, jokbal (pig's feet) and dalkbal (chicken feet). The prices were a lot more than you would normally pay for this type of food- 10,000 each for the jeon and chicken feet, 8,000 for the jokbal and 7,000 for the sundae. Big bottles of Cass were 5,000 each. There were no prices displayed.  I live in Korea so I've tried these dishes before. I was disappointed with the quality of the food, especially for the price. Street food is normally cheap and tasty with prices displayed clearly.  It's possible that we were unlucky with the stall we chose, but in a city where there is so much delicious, good value food available, I wouldn't bother giving Gwangjang Market another chance.",Positive
875,"This place has the biggest selection of seafood pancakes I've ever seen. I'd never had one before this, but they were soooo good!! There was also a ton of other local food there being sold by street vendors, and a lot of it looked amazing (except maybe the pig snouts). I didn't find much else here. It seems to be a local textile market, so if you know anyone that likes to sew or collects buttons, then this is a great place to go!",Positive
876,"When it comes to the word ""market"", most people would think it's the place to do grocery shopping (i.e: buying vegetable goods to cook for next meal)  Gwangjang Market has more than that. If you're looking for traditional hanbok (for grownups and children, ready made or custom tailored ones), this is the place. Also, one of many places to have traditional food like the bibimbap, tteokbokki, patbingsu and bindatteok.",Positive
877,"This is the best place if you wanna shop for authentic and beautiful hanboks plus everything else that goes with it from hair accessories to shoes! Go around and you'll find more Korean handicrafts like wood sculptures, even dolls or wonderful bags for great souvenirs! This is also the place to dig into what they call the ""drug kimbap"" or gimbap! We had it for breakfast along with fish soup and it was yummy! Choose from many ahjummas selling wonderful eats at the center of the market and you'll have a memorable meal. Pass by here, it's definitely worth it!",Positive
878,"lots of local foods, tradition souvenir shop. most famous market in seoul, must visit place. food is awesome.",Positive
879,"It is a wholesale market where one can buy fabrics, hanboks, beddings, shoes, bags and dried food. Do visit the Eatery Alley where one can savor generous portions of reasonably priced street foods like jeon ( pancake) , yangnyeom chicken, kall-guksu ( noodle soup), bulgogi ( grilled beef slices), bibimbap ( mixed rice of vegetables, stir fried beef and egg) .",Positive
880,"Gwangjang Market is located near a subway station and you need around an hour to explore all the stalls. There is a place that sells Korean hanbok, it consists of many stores located in one place. I also heard there's this secondhand clothes market but unfortunately I didn't go there. I tried the famous bindaetteok and Korean pancake (with veggies and meat). A Korean natives who guided me said that the place where I had my pancake is the place where the American director Tim Burton ate the same meal. I can't remember the name but the place is quite small and you have to queue to get inside. Also, you will be asked to leave when you are done eating because the queue is extremely long!",Negative
881,"I purchased several childrens hanboks here. There is one stall selling kids hanboks in the upper level hanbok market, and several stalls on the ground level. Kids hanboks are $60 and up.  The food market portion is fantastic! Try the fresh and piping hot bindaetteok.",Positive
882,"Went there on a busy Tuesday evening for dinner. We didn't check out all the stalls available coz it's quite big & we were hungry. We only walked thru the right lane to check out the food stalls. After noticing the food were similar, we settled at a stall with many customers thinking that it may be a good deal. We had the famous pancake, the stir fried glass noodle (japchae) & the braised pork knuckle. The pancake was really delicious while the japchae was a bit over seasoned with pepper. The pork knuckle should be tasty if it's not served cold but I guess it's the way they eat it here. Total costs 15k krw. Be careful when you are not speaking Korean, they might mistaken that you wanna order although you only wanna ask wat the dish they are selling. After dinner we walked the other aisle only to find out that there are many other variety of food there.  Tips: check out all the stalls to decide what you wanna eat. Be careful with your belongings coz you are not in a restaurant & there are always people passing by/behind you while you eat.",Positive
883,"Saw this place on Runningman. The food selection there was amazing! Pancakes were delicious and so were the noodles. I was too stuffed to eat anything else. However, the beautiful colours of all the food being sold will make you salivate. A visual feast! A treat for the avid food photographer! Do not go on a Sunday if you wish to see more than just food as most of the other shops are closed (only food stalls remain open). If you are only going for the food, well then, sundays are okay. :)",Positive
884,"Our host recommended this as a traditional Korean market and I am glad we took her advice. So much food, we wanted to try everything. The pork chops and the fried veggies were the best. Also very cheap.",Positive
885,"Went here mainly because of the food court! It was one of the best places in Seoul to experience authentic Korean food. I really enjoyed our lunch here! Was able to find and try out some KBS approved food stalls. Oh and if you love pickled vegetables, this is the place to be! Pickled radish, pickled cucumber, kimchi, you name it, this market's got it!",Positive
886,"It’s an indoor market. We went on a Sunday and some shops are closed so we headed straight to the food court. The food section were huge and busy with tons of tourists. There were many vendors selling the same food so walk around before you decide to sit down. We had many quick stops - Korean fried chicken, bibibap, fried green beans cake, fried pork cake, grilled red bean cake, bamboo-like juice, fried donut…etc… If you dare to try, vendors are selling live octopus (not sashimi, they eat them live). We also found a store near the food court selling cheaper ginseng tea and candies (with bargain of course).",Positive
887,"This market is very good for vegetables and other edibles. It is mainly a clothing market and has little to attract tourists from a souvenir perspective, but the cooked food area has a lot of pancakes and fried goodies, along with lots of meat and seafood. Definitely a good choice for cheap eats.",Positive
888,"Lots of food and clothes vendors. Interesting to see the different foods that are being sold. I love the onion pancakes. Shoes , clothes umbrellas are all very cheap. Just walk around and sample the local food/drinks. If you enjoy bargaining then you will get a chance to brush up your skills when buying non food items",Positive
889,"We went here with a Korean friend so it was not difficult to buy Korean Pancakes and Magkeolli wine. We ate with the other Koreans, and of course, it was privileged to experience eat in an open resto inside the market.  YOu can see lots of food and souvenirs! We were not able to buy souvenirs as it was already late and we still have some places to go!",Positive
890,"Massive market with many food stalls selling basically the same things, the spicy rice cakes, the rice rolls, mungbean pancakes, pig innards, kimchi dumplings. Nothing special for us but the atmosphere is good, I recommend to go to experience the vibe.  We walked further into the market, past the food stalls and found a local restaurant selling fish hotpot. It was GOOD! Cant remember the name as it's in korean.",Positive
891,"It was massive, and probably not a destination if you have something specific in mind. Maybe good for a long-term traveller to explore, but not so good for a family on vacation.",Positive
892,"Gwangjang Market is the oldest open market in Seoul and may possibly one of the largest. There are miles and miles of vendors selling just about everything. The bean pancakes are the food items they are best known for, but there are many other dishes such as drug kimbap and pig's feet, Many of the vendors also sell dozens of buckets of side dishes and of course you can take a taste test before committing. It is definitely worth your time because you'll trip on just about everything there.",Positive
893,Gwangjang Market was bustling with great Korean food stalls. The kimchi dumplings are great as are the mung bean pancakes.,Positive
894,Loved this market and all the food displays. Great food and nice to see all of it displayed. They have clothes there but did not buy anything,Positive
895,Just a market like all the others... Not as great as it is hyped up to be... There is better value/interestingness elsewhere ... Personally I orefer insadong area...,Positive
896,It is a great place mainly for eating. The place is jam-packed with food stalls serving tasty treats at reasonable prices. However majority of the food is of the oily kind. It is not really a shopping place for tourists. The shopping caters more to the locals for the raw ingredients and traditional clothes and medicines. But it is an eye opener. It situates right next to Dongdaemun which is definitely a tourist shopping haven with shops in Migliore open till late like 4am.,Positive
897,Enjoyed some tasty deep fried food. It was way too busy here for me. Narrow entries filled with tables. There is a major camera and accessory sales area here too... Take your pick!,Positive
898,Nice place with great food. I had Topoki and sushi. I think it is a good thing to have on your Seoul todo list.,Positive
899,"We were searching for one of the gates and came across this market. So packed and sooo lively. It was a good experience, but didnt get anything. It was soooo hot that day",Positive
900,"We only visited at night to try the food eats. Very fun atmosphere, great mung bean pancakes. I imagine it would be fun to explore during the day.",Positive
901,"I went to Gwangjang Market for research. So I looked around carefully. You can get a variety of clothes including Hanbok(traditional Korean costume) in a cheap and reasonable price, fabrics, kitchen appliances and more. Another reason tourists visit is the food; Mayak Gimbab, Jeon(Koraen-style pancake), Sundae(pork roll), Jokbal(pork hocks), Tteokbokki(seasoned rice cake) and many more. Why don't you traditional Korean market food in busy and festive street?",Positive
902,"Perfect place to taste authentic Korean food from vendors specializing in particular menus. You can eat, drink (soju or Makgeolli) and relax watching crowd going by. You can feel Korea there. I tried kal-mandukuk in vendor No 13 and mandu in vendor No 70. Both just great.",Positive
903,A great place to experience Korean local food where a lot of Koreans actually come here to have their dinner after work. Most of the food stalls here are manned by ahjumas (middle-aged women) and they couldn't really understand English. Food being ordered using hand and sign languages. A perfect place to enjoy cheap local food and experience the local culture. The mungbean pancake is one of the must try here.,Positive
904,"I told my tour guide that I love to watch running man and he brought us here for the food. It was really delicious! I tried the famous gimbap and the really tasty pancake! I did also tried the vege-bibimbap there. It serves with fermented soy soup (i guess) i love it soo much! Even my 4 year old daugther kept on sipping the soup! The people around were extremely friendly (eventhough they were all talking in koreans) but im sure they're bieng nice as some of them handed coins and chocolate milk to my daughter! But it was a bit smelly though...mybe because it is a market place. Overall, the food is really nice!!!",Positive
905,"There was a pancake alley, a kimbap and soup alley n a bimbibap alley. The kimbap is delicious. We tried the stall with the kbs sign and it did not disappoint. It's somewhere in the middle of the alley. We weren't charged for the rice drink we had at her stall too. Wasn't sure whether the aunty was being nice or that the drink was free. Either way, it was undoubtly one of the cheapest and best food i had in seoul.",Positive
906,"As a solo male traveller, I only found this place mildly interesting. I was not buying a Hanbuk or any other clothes or souvenirs, but it was interesting to walk along the side streets and see glimpses of local life.  Truth be told, most of the souvenirs etc can easily be found at other areas in Seoul. The same can be said for the street snacks, though there seems to be more pancake stalls congregated here.  Good to pass a couple of hours, especially as it it also near Dongdaemun retail markets.",Positive
907,"There are many cooked food stalls in the market. And also many raw food materials, kimchi, clothings, etc. Interesting place",Positive
908,Must visit for Authentic Korean food and fabrics! Bought all my marinated stuff here- though we did not speak Korean! Friendly Ajuma gave us hot coffe as it was really cold! Mouth watering local dishes here to try!,Negative
909,"This place is full of stalls selling food, fabric etc! Loved the tteokbukki, kimbap, odeng, bindaetteok! Wished that the stomach can hold more food like the Patju (Red bean porridge)! Didn't dare to try the blood sausage though. There's this bindaetteok place with seats inside that's rather famous. Do make sure to try the one with the meat as well. :)",Positive
910,"What an amazing place! loads of mouth watering local dishes here, with a buzzing atmosphere. Pancakes were the best, and lots of different Kimchi options up and down the market. Very reasonably priced and everybody just sits together at shared tables. Try the Korean wine in the small green bottles. It looks like milk, is fizzy, but delicious, and goes great with the food.",Positive
911,"We went to Gwangjang Market to have a ""street food"" experience in Seoul, and it did not disappoint. The hand-cut noodles we got were incredible, and the woman who served us could not have been nicer (although she spoke no English). This should be a must-do stop on any trip to Seoul.",Negative
912,We did not get here until 9pm so most shops/stalls closed but street food sellers / restaurants a plenty still open for business! We ended up eating 3 times as could not resist the amazing food! We enjoyed spicy pancakes with rice wine - delicious even my 7 year old enjoyed them! Next restaurant we had a pork BBQ which was fantastic and we finished up with some sweet snacks at a small fruit / ice place! Well it was the last night of our trip! A busy place which was fun! Easy to get to on subways/ bus we went one way on each! I regret not going earlier in the day to experience the full market it must be amazing Enjpy,Positive
913,"MUST eat Bindaedeok (Mung bean pancake) ... spicy chicken feet is awesome too.  Walk along the stretch of food stalls and u'll see a shop selling seaweed, drinks and snacks. This Ahjumma sells even cheaper then Namdaemuen.  there's a vintage clothes section on the 2nd flr but its a little messy...  Things you can find there::  - Traditional Korean Wedding Stuff (no trying thou) - Hanboks - Fresh Seafood - Textile/ Cloth - Vintage clothes - Loads of local food",Positive
914,"Don't miss this market during your visit to Seoul. The fried mung bean pancakes are awesome and a specialty here. Read the wiki page for a little history. I had one with pork inside, mmmm tasty. Definately a highlight.",Positive
915,"Feel the nearest vibes to how a traditional market is and coming here allows us to have a better understanding of their normal daily lives... The area is huge which ranges from stores offering their local snacks, seafoods to shops selling hanbok,blankets, pots and lots of stores selling cloths... etc... if u're not in a rush for time, just choose a store and have your lunch here :-) it's affordable and a different kind of experience too We like it here and recommend to anyone who's in Seoul!",Positive
916,"It's good to come here to experience seoul's morning market. It's a really big market which was sectioned accordingly, food, textile, clothes, kitchenware, etc....  You can try out all sort of korean snacks over here at a reasonable price. In addition, we manage to find a souvenir shop which is selling cheaper than namdaemun.  So, highly recommended!!!",Positive
917,"there are so many street food restaurant. really exciting place to enjoy Korea life. whenever my foreign friends come to Seoul, i always invite them to there. Foreigner can understand Korean and Korean food culture by the market.",Positive
918,If you like to get a little outside of the tourist comfort zone box this is a good spot. It is a market with a variety of goods to buy (raw materials as well as clothing etc). There are also street food vendors that serve up tasty treats! (caution if you have food allergies - menus will not have much is any English description; we did the point and nod to get ours). You might not come away with many purchases for things to take home but the experience is very worth it.,Positive
919,"I wanted to try the local food in this particular market , and boy was I not disappointed. The market is typical , but the atmosphere is authentic ! The food superb ! The ajumas are very nice to me as I had too many questions regarding the interesting looking spread of food they have for tasting ! A must visit , mashita !",Positive
920,"I really enjoyed our tour of the market. It's so huge. They have all sorts of items to buy from clothes, shoes, dried foods, etc. What I enjoyed most is the yummy food that can be eaten there! Even if it's winter, the seats are warm with heating system so we can still eat leisurely. But it is best if you go there with someone who can speak Korean because the sellers only communicate in their language.",Positive
921,"Kwang Jang is a vast indoor market at the junction of two main thoroughfares in central Seoul. It is home to bewildering number of food stalls selling Korean delicacies at affordable prices, and also an array of clothes vendors. If you are looking to buy an embroidered traditional Korean gown, this is the place to visit. You can easily spend a couple of hours browsing in Kwang Jang, enjoyed the colours and the vibrancy.",Positive
922,"Traditional Korean food on offer, albeit it is all market style. You may have to sit outdoors, on wooden planks, but it's still all a part of the experience. Gotta go atleast once. That may be enough though. haha",Positive
923,"Gwangjang Market located in central Seoul, next to Chungae stream. It's really crowded and busy place except on Sunday. You can buy Korean traditional dresses, shoes, clothes etc..and enjoy yummy food!  To buy Hanbok, traditional Korean dress, Go upstairs where wholesalers located! you can buy Tailored Korean silk dress set by 1/2 price to Gangnam area. (it took for 3-5 days for express, normally 7-10 days)",Positive
924,It was not quite good specially the restaurant and the menu.,Negative
925,"As a traditional market that you would go to in order to buy stuff, this particular market specializes in clothing, whole cloth, traditional Korean clothing, tailors, shoes, blankets and bedding, etc. We saw a whole lot of stuff like that, in any event. But the real reason any tourist or foreigner would want to go there is for the food experience. The market is famous for their mung bean pancakes, but the various food vendors there sell all the different savory and sweet pancakes famous in Korean street food, as well as bibimbap and various fish and pork stews and sausages and things like that.  It's basically a foodie paradise if you're looking for the traditional korean experience of eating street food and common Korean food in public with real Korean people. There aren't as many tourists at this market as some of the more famous ones like Dongdaemun or Namdaemun, and if you go early in the day, like around noon or before, it's not crowded and you can take the time to enjoy a relaxing meal sitting on a bench at one of the many little food places that are crammed into this place. They also have clearly marked street signs throughout the place directing you to the various exits and subway stations and local landmarks and the food court area, as well as conveniently located bathrooms, although I can't vouch for cleanliness exactly. All I can say is they weren't the worst I've seen and they seemed to be easier to find and use than some of the other markets.  I went there with a friend and we stopped at the first place we found that had mung bean pancakes and ended up talking with an older Korean gentleman that was so friendly and liked us so much that he bought our meal after feeding us some of his soju and offering us his cigarettes. I will be going back so that if I see him again I can buy his meal the next time, as we agreed.",Positive
926,"The Gwangjang market is a mini-food paradise. Try the bin dae ddok (Korean style pancake made from ground mung beans ** highly recommended **), pigs trotters (my mum was a little disappointed that the trotters felt a little cold), seafood sashimi, and many more yummy local food. If you are in Seoul, make sure you do not give this a miss.",Positive
927,"Interesting local market. Sat down at one of the stalls and ordered everything on offer from the cold sliced meats, noodles, and Korean rice rolls. Enjoyed all of it and for a good price.",Positive
928,"This is a market, make no mistake about it. The place offers you a view into the Korea market, and also provide an opportunity to taste some of the traditional foods that even the local eat. So walk around, find a food you are interested, sit down, point at it, order it and try it!  After eating, stroll around the clothes/hanbok section to see if you fancy making a hanbok for yourself, or pick up a packet of korean ginseng sweets.  After that, you can drop by the Cheonggyecheon, an eco-friendly drain/canal development, which is just beside near where the market is located.",Positive
929,"We went to this market to look for the traditional Korean Hanbok, as this market was recommended. Most of the stores are tailors who make outfits to order, with a few who sell ready made outfits in different sizes. You can only choose from the styles that are in your size in the ready made stores. We were delighted when we saw the hive of excitement and activity that went on in the traditional food court area of this market. The atmosphere was amazing and it was so interesting to walk around the food stalls and see the various local dishes on offer. It was lunchtime, so the place was alive with activity. What a bonus to our trip to the market! If you enjoy soaking up the local atmosphere, you have to go! Have fun!",Positive
930,"Visit this market not just for shopping, but to see the wares and to eat delicious street food. If you come late enough at night, you can see businessmen relaxing with a bottle of makgeolli and eating spicy treats.",Positive
931,"What can you find here? traditional foods, various produce from all over Korea, and also this place is famous as a center for selling hanbok, Korean traditional clothes.",Neutral
932,"I enjoy my bindaetteok and makgeolli right here but you can find the way Seoul ppl live their life from this market. This market is good for foodies, Bibimbap with a selection of vegetables and bori rice. I do love it, very chewy and tasty.",Positive
933,"Lanes lined with stalls selling a variety of items and worth visiting for the atmosphere, even if you do not want to buy anything.",Positive
934,"I love sewing bags as a hobby, and this was a great place to look for fabrics. There are plenty of shops selling fabrics, but many of them are for quilts and Korean wedding costumes. I would recommend you go to Dongdaemun Shopping Town for fabrics and hobby crafts! Nevertheless this place is GREAT for mungbean flat cakes!! I think the local name is bindaeduk. I had a big one which seemed to be just vegetables, and a smaller one which seemed to have meat in it. Cost me 6,000won in total and I inhaled every bit of it. 2 thumbs up. I couldn't speak a word of Korean but nothing will keep me away from these delicious yummies!! I propose going to those shops you see at the side, rather than eat at those open space type counters. Seems just a tad more hygienic.",Positive
