215,4.0,I did and didnt enjoy this The museum is big and if you want to see everything you should allow a few hours Free to enter Given all the information and history I am quite surprised they dont charge I just found information was not that easy to understand or well laid out I got more confused although at the sane time I did learn a lot of things I just think it could be laid out better Some parts were in Korean only I went as soon as it opened There were already quite a few school children but as the museum was so big and spacious it was still peaceful to browse Clean What was nice to watch was just outside the main entrance young army recruits were practising and performing This was interesting to see I would say if your very into history and learning then come I normally am but for some reason struggled to grasp much here I spent just over an hour and a half there for a basic overview,Positive,0.9386,Positive

220,3.0,Ive had the good fortune of being able to visit the war museums in both North Korea and South Korea What is most striking is how similar the museums in Pyongyang and Seoul are  In front of both are aggressive statues of military men Both have an outdoor exhibit of military machinery like vehicles and airplanes But whereas the museum in Pyongyang proudly displays the USS Pueblo the museum in Seoul displays happy childrens mascots in uniform of course and a playground which is weird to say the least in a war museum Both museums love a good panorama exhibit  And finally both rely very heavily on propaganda For example the two different sides are called Attackers at dawn and Defenders of freedom And while the museum happily described the atrocities carried out by the North it does not mention with a single peep the atrocities carried out by the South The exact opposite can be said about the museum in Pyongyang of course  If you are looking for any kind of truth about the war you would have to look elsewhere But if youre interested in how a country wants to present their image about a war both museums are very interesting indeed,Negative,0.9494,Positive

226,5.0,The whole museum is beautiful as it goes back to ancient times What really got us feeling proud was the list of Canadian soldiers who died in defending Korea and it opened our eyes as to how that war got started in the first place This was part of the one day DMZ trip,Positive,0.0679,Positive

230,5.0,As a veteran I am a lover of places that price and honor the fellow and good military men and women of the past and present; Men and Women who gave the ultimate sacrifice for the sake of freedom and liberty In this vein I dedicate part of every travel we make with our company to search for Memorials and Museums of War  The War Memorial of Korea as expected for the history of this country is no disappointment It opened in 1994 on the former site of the army headquarters to exhibit and memorialize the military history of Korea and it holds an exquisite collection and memorabilia of several past wars ranging from prehistoric times with very rudimentary weapons; passing with extreme detail throughout the Korean War and the ROK Armed Forces until more modern conflicts and the presence of South Korea as an allied in the United Nations  13000 items are displayed in six halls under different themes and about 100 large weapons are displayed in the outside exhibition area on the lawns around the building  Outside the building premises you can see a great variety of mobile units such as fixedwing aircrafts like the De Havilland Canada U6A Beaver the Curtiss C46D20CU Commando also the Fairchild C123J built in 1956 as a C123B and later converted to a C123J in the 1960s Helicopters are also in the premises such as the Bell AH1J \xe2\x80\x9cInternational Cobra\xe2\x80\x9d also the Bell UH1B Iroquois even Russian units as the Sikorsky H5H Dragonfly and the Sikorsky HH19B Chickasaw But there are more mobile units such as armored vehicles artillery and antiaircraft guns Missiles and several other maritime vessels like the Hurricane Aircat Airboat used by ROK special forces during the Vietnam War and much more well kept pieces of war history are exhibited here at the War Memorial of Korea  The place definitely has been groomed to detail and has also a special glow about it; meaning a building with a soul I truly recommend this place for the lovers of War History and War Artifacts and here you will also find a special place for the special connection we have with those who gave it all for the sake of freedom in South Korea and everywhere else,Positive,0.895,Positive
231,5.0,I planned to go here mainly for my boys Ages 9 and 6 because they wanted to see tanks and planes but I surprisingly learned a lot The guide we had Mr Kim was very knowledgeable and it was so interesting to see how grateful he was to the US and their help He says if it wasnt for the US and their help they would be a communist country under North Korea It was interesting to hear the history from someone who actually experienced it Definitely a must see,Positive,0.9816,Positive
232,5.0,one of the must see museums in my opinion they did a great job presenting the Korean war and its immediate aftermath the museum used to be a bit too much propaganda but they have make it more objective  gone are the famous pictures of the happy children of South Korea and the starving children of North Korea that was a bit too much in my opinion the museum is close to the national museum see my review and the Samsun ilan museum in near by Itaewon Itaewon is still a good bet for lunch or dinner after musuem hopping,Positive,0.7003,Positive

257,5.0,Even if you dont like war memorials this museum is definitely worth visiting I actually enjoy these museums because it is not idolizing the wars but reminding us the importance of peace and its true cost paid by those who lived and died I have been rather disappointed by many of the museums in Korea I expect places to be large but way too many of them have been tiny This place is grand and has many interesting displays that make it worth your time It is free so that assumption is hard to make The place is clean easy to navigate and fun for the whole family Remember that the wars commemorated here are related to Korea but many nations are represented because the world cared about defeating evil at one point Wasnt all about profits and greed Whole visit should be about 2 hours if you are a casual goer,Positive,0.9793,Positive

309,5.0,I have visited the War Memorial of Korea over the past several years and it seems to improve with each visit The information is well presented and honors Soldiers from all nations that contributed to the war efforts There are many floorsexhibitions to visit and it can be a bit much for just one visit  thankfully the museum is easily access from the metro just off Samgaki Station  line 4 or 6 exit 1012 or Namyeong Station  line 1 exit 1 and general admission is free There is an outdoor exhibit for children and the interior is appropriate for all ages may appeal more to older children I would highly recommend a visit to put things in perspective during your visit to Korea,Positive,0.8687,Positive
310,5.0,Seoul has many state funded museums and forms the ones Ive visited or know of all are well presented It seems little is spared to put on a hood high quality show The National War Museum is no different It showcases her military history from the earliest period up to the Korean War Youd be surprised that Korea is not the doormat people perceive But a proud and sophicated nation There are things on display that you would not expect and not mentioned in books elsewhere Ive seen pictures of the turtle boat but to sea in person is a nice experience Yes is a scaled replica but its still impressive There is also the large outdoor display With a number of Korean War period planes and tanks Also other retired items of hardware Youd have to pay good money to see this elsewhere but all free in Seoul There is a B52 bomber which is smaller than I thought At the time of my visit done halls and the outdoor display was closed off for maintenance There are plenty of toilets most displays have English and I suppose the only let down is that the giftshop You can spend a fair few hours here,Positive,0.959,Positive

312,5.0,Last fall I timed my visit here to coincide with a free Honor Guard Ceremony that took place at 2 pm on Fridays between midOctober and the end of November I found it fascinating to watch the military band marchers in colorful attire and displays of military precision on the massive space in front of the memorials entrance But I was even more absorbed later by the museums displays both inside and outside   Focused mainly on the Korean War 195053 the three floors of rooms also include a look at Koreas history of resisting foreign aggression such as the defeat of a large Khitan army in 1019 The Korean War rooms take visitors from what led to the Southward invasion by North Korea to the Armistice and the role of the United Nations Nicely curated the rooms present the nations War history through objects films and information boards which have many details in English  The outside exhibits display memorials and statues such as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Brothers\xe2\x80\x9d which is the symbol of the Korean War and symbolizes reconciliation love and forgiveness The big bronze depicts a true story of two brothers one from the South and the other from the North embracing after meeting on the battlefield I found this piece to be extremely moving  On the East side of the complex I was amazed by the overwhelming number of big items displayed related to the Korean War These include aircraft such as a bomber and a helicopter and armored vehicles Visitors are invited to explore the artifacts and I saw many taking advantage of the opportunity  The War Memorial is open from 9 am to 6 pm Tuesday through Sunday and offers free admission Subway lines 4 and 6 have a stop Samgakji nearby Take Exit 12 If coming here in the spring or fall when the Honor Guard Ceremony is held consider checking on its schedule to include It in your visit,Positive,0.0516,Positive

316,5.0,From the moment you walk into the building you can feel the solemnity of the environment The combination of minimalistic decorations sometimes contrasts with the sheer size of some of the exhibits; giving me always that feeling that peace is easy and simple but only if we really make that great decision to make it our goal instead of the side effect of overtaking others by force I fell in love with South Korea and this place had a good part in that,Positive,0.9694,Positive
317,5.0,Thats the poignant catch phrase that sums up the general feel of the War memorial  There are indoor and outdoor exhibits that makes this old school museum a sight to behold The exhibits are grouped into 2 main rooms  one from the norths and one from the souths perspectives  There are complimentary tours with a volunteer doyenne and I barely made it to the 2pm session with Chang theres one more at 10am although there is plenty of English explanation and if you use the guided audio youd be in good stead  Chang brought life to our walk particularly when he provided a glimpse to his life as a Korean War survivor he was barely 3 then and how his ancestral home was South according to the 38 Parallel but because of the DMZ now belonged to the North and hes rendered homeless If you know how much the Koreans repeat nay treasure their ancestral hometowns you can almost hear his angst through his thick accented English  Yet his gratitude and humility shone through  All in all an educational tour And a must see Set aside 34 hours to go through the exhibits thoroughly,Positive,0.7906,Positive
318,5.0,Large museum with engaging presentation of historical facts Outdoor area has real military equipment including planes tanks and boats some of which can be climbed on or in Indoor area has multiple video displays or 4d movies as well as standard plaques  A couple floors dedicated to the Korean war while another floor has ancient war history including a very cool scale replica of a turtle ship  Very tasteful and honoring memorial to fallen soldiers and overall great presentation of historical facts on the Korean war I plan to come to this museum whenever I visit Seoul,Positive,0.3729,Positive

322,5.0,This is a poignant reminder of what happened during the korean war It is very big so allot some time to be able to appreciate this museum At the back are old planes that were used and a boat where you can go up and take pictures At the entrance of the museum are the flags of all the countries that helped them during the war and a short message of what their contribution is to the koreans I like it that they write each message in English and in the native language of each country A must see in when you visit Korea,Positive,-0.5574,Negative
323,5.0,If you have time to visit this museum you will learn so much about the history of the Wars in Korea One of the best museums we have ever visited and well worth seeing Allow at least a half a day or more to make sure you get to see all that the museum has on show,Positive,0.7943,Positive

326,5.0,We got here late so we had very little time to peruse the grounds but we did have time to see the memorial and find the names of our relatives It is an amazing place and allows one to realize the full cost of the Korean War to all the countries that participated I had no idea so many countries were involved Note of caution If you take the Hop On Hop Off bus they drop you have quite a distance from the entrance That is why we were late Its a long walk,Positive,-0.6808,Negative
327,5.0,The best military museum Ive ever seen Koreas War Memorial has about 650000 squarefeet under roof and more than 60 fixedwing aircraft choppers tanks artillery pieces missiles and naval vessels outside in the rain You get a crash course in the history of Korean warfare from neolithic spearfights to modern times civil wars between ancient ethnic groups invasions by the Chinese Japanese Mongols Manchus and so on; the centurieslong Japanese pirate fleet threat; the 19th century attacks by various Western powers; all the way up to the Vietnam War when more than a third of a million ROK troops supported Saigon  Most of these wars battles sieges victories and defeats will be terra incognita to foreign visitors But its all interesting and wellpresented Curatorship is outstanding 21st century technology helps if you see locals watching any animation on pirate fleets citywall sieges et cetera stop and watch the spectacle with them  Most military museums focus on generals and admirals soldiers and sailors strategy tactics and the various regiments or battleships involved in the fighting The War Memorial goes beyond the fighting forces to also provide information about noncombatants This is underscored before you even walk into the museum in monumental statues of both soldiers and the victims of war see The Warriors and The Victims photos  Not surprisingly half the indoor area is focused on the 1950s Korean War I walked in with a fair grasp of the military changes of fortune in that war such as the Norths surprise attack which captured Seoul within 48 hours What Id never known before was that not only did the Northerners carefully plan exactly how and when theyd attack but they also carefully planned the sweeping atrocities they would inflict on the civilian population of Seoul as soon as they captured the city If you were on their list you and your family disappeared within 48 hours of takeover; thousands were on their list  The museums information on the war is sweeping The commitments made to the North by Stalin and Mao prior to the attack Douglas MacArthurs determination to turn the tide with the Inchon landings against the opinion of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and the massive winter counterattack of Chinese forces are all presented clearly and cogently  The Korean War is also unusual because of the ROKs powerful ally the United Nations fought on their side There have been UN peacekeeping missions since to the Balkans and other areas but never again anything like this Two dozen nations from Europe Asia Africa Australia and both North and South America fought under the UN flag to save the people and legitimate government of Korea Several rooms of the museum focus on the UN decision and the UN leadership of Trygve Lie The museum notes that immediately upon hearing of the attack on the ROK Lie called an emergency meeting of the Security Council for the next day and the UN support for the ROK was proposed argued revised and passed the same day The museum names the countries which supported the UN resolution the one who abstained Titos Yugoslavia and the member state which was absent the USSR It doesnt mention one interesting bit the USSRs delegate was refusing to attend UN meetings over a totally different issue\xe2\x80\x94the seating of the PRC\xe2\x80\x94another partner in the attack But had he attended I believe the USSR could simply have vetoed the resolution in which case the ROK wouldnt have been defended under the UN banner and the UN in all likelihood would have gone down the drain like the League of Nations At any rate you get to see a diorama of Douglas MacArthur receiving the UN flag that theyd all be fighting under see UN Flag photo  A large area of one floor provides information on every nation that sent military personnel to Korea as well as every nation that sent medical personnel some of Indias and Denmarks noncombatant personnel also died in Korea Each of these countries has a special area in the museum where you can learn how they contributed how long they were in Korea where they fought and how many died see Thailand Display photo The information for each country is in Korean English and that countrys national language Greeces in Greek; Colombias in Spanish and so on Since Belgium is bilingual you can read or hear about Belgian forces in Korean English French or Nederlands This United Nations aspect of the war is symbolized before you even enter the museum by the national flags of the contributing states flying in a semicircle around of the facade see International Flags photo  Each of the national stories is interesting Luxembourgs infantrymen were integrated for the duration with the Belgians and although the headcount of Luxembourg fighting forces was small as a percentage of total national population it was one of the highest of any of the countries Turkey sent a brigadesize integrated unit of artillery ordinance engineering and transport which inflicted ten times more enemy casualties that it received  In 1950 there were only three independent counties in subSaharan Africa; all three contributed South Africa sent pilots Liberia supported civilian relief I thought Ethiopias story was the most amazing of all Haile Selassie was a strong proponent of collective security; hed appealed for support from the League of Nations when Mussolini invaded Ethiopia and hadnt gotten it So he wanted Ethiopia to help Korea another innocent country but Ethiopia had no army Solution the Emperor sent his Palace Guards The guardsmen werent trained for combat so US instructors gave them a threemonth crash course and attached them to the US 7th Infantry Division The Imperial Guard did just fine the museum has videos of them marching upcountry where among other battles they fought at Pork Chop Hill  The museum also addresses the impact of the war on individual men and women of the allied nations For example an Aussie who left his pregnant wife to go to Korea died there; his wife never remarried; more than half a century later her ashes were buried in the Korean grave of the husband she lost in her youth see Mrs Shepherd photo Another Australian widow Nancy Hummerston was buried at Koreas UN Memorial Cemetery even more recently in 2010 sixty years after Captain Hummerston died defending the ROK  I spent the best part of a day here and could have spent longer had they not been closing Among my favorite sights were   A replica of an 500year old dragonbowed Korean battleship reduced to frigate size so it would fit in the central courtyard but still impressive Battleship photo   A grand gallery of military paintings around the walls of that courtyard including Koreas crushing defeat of a French invasion force sent by Napoleon III in 1866 KapkotJin photo; that same year Napoleon IIIs army was also beaten by the Mexicans; figuring the odds of losing three in a row were negligible the IIItime loser then declared war on Prussia   Korean \xe2\x80\x9cknights\xe2\x80\x9d using tridentspears rather than the lances of their European counterparts see Trident Knight photo   An ingenious ancient Korean contraption for rapid fire of multiple arrows see Gatling Bow photo   Something for the children a miniature Korean castle they can climb onto to man the bastions Hawseong Fortress photo   A huge drum commemorating the 60th anniversary of the founding of the ROK armed forces Mother of All WarDrums photo   A modest little inflatable Aircat airboat used by the ROK for river and marsh reconnaisance in Vietnam and equipped with A60 machineguns This beaut is outdoors with the other military hardware big impressive fighters bombers heavy artillery and tanks so the little fellow goes virtually unnoticed But back home in south Louisiana \xe2\x80\x9cCajuns\xe2\x80\x9d down on the bayous use airboats to get around in the swamps where they hunt alligators for gumbo You could hunt any number and size of gators you liked if you had an A60 machinegun on board ROK Aircat photo   Also outdoors but much nearer the street a 20yearold exact replica of the tallest of all Korean monuments a foursided monster 639 meters high inscribed with 1770 Chinese calligraphs The original still exists but was carted off to China long ago and isnt likely to be returned anytime soon An impressive placard informs us that \xe2\x80\x9cThe monument of King Gwanggaeto the Great 391413 was built by his son King Jangsu 413491 in 414 BC in Gungnaeseong the capital city of Goguryeo\xe2\x80\x9d to honor his fathers conquests and the founding of the kingdom And in small print were also advised that \xe2\x80\x9cThe translation of the inscription was advised by experts in the relevant fields in 2005\xe2\x80\x9d Apparently chronology wasnt one of the \xe2\x80\x9crelevant fields\xe2\x80\x9d that anybody was an expert in since 414 BC precedes 391413 BC rather than following it Still its an impressive replica of Koreas grandest ancient monument Monumental Error photo,Positive,-0.9798,Negative

353,5.0,We visited the War Memorial of Korea today It was my second visit and it is well worth the time to explore The building and grounds are beautiful and full of war relics From prehistoric weapons displays from different eras in Korean history to the hightech displays to Admiral sunshins turtle ship it is all here impressively displayed Admission is by donation The only suggestion that I would make is to have the address written in hangul on website for the cab drivers Be prepared to spend hours here Its worth it,Positive,0.5106,Positive
354,4.0,Attempting to find ones way from the subway stations can be challenging since the signnage is very poor exit 12 from Line 6 is the easiest line 4 more difficult The memorial itself however is well presented and I am sure it would be much more interesting to those with a military background,Positive,0.5584,Positive

357,5.0,A total look at Korea at war from early time through Japanese imperial invasions to present day Well worth the visit,Positive,-0.2263,Negative
358,4.0,As war museums go this was all the encompassing for the Korean Peninsula Korean friends back home stressed that we must see this Well there is a fair bit of jingoism here and I can see why Koreans feel strongly about it If stressed for time this is a miss,Positive,-0.1091,Negative
359,5.0,If you plan on coming here then dont be rushed There is so much to see We had to plan well as we were on a time limit We visited the rooms about the Korean War which were really informative and interesting The English is just fine They have rooms on further back in history which we didnt have time to visit Absolutely huge building Theres a cafe selling nice smoothies and a gift shop on sight Outside is amazing too  loads of fighter planes and tanks and of course the super impressive war memorial statue What a great place to be free as well,Positive,0.9787,Positive
360,4.0,This place not only documents the Korean war but also pays tribute to all the nations that sent their sons to fight for the Korean people Very moving,Positive,-0.705,Negative
361,5.0,For most of us who are uninitiated about the Korean War you mostly think of it as a US war like Vietnam However the War Memorial of Korea really open your eyes that it involved the UN and China  The museum doesnt just focus on the Korean war  it highlights how Korea fought in wars during the ancient days and its involvement in modern day conflicts  I joined a free guided tour in the morning Although the tour guides English was quite accented he was very enthusiastic about what he was talking about,Positive,-0.9414,Negative
362,4.0,Initially I thought this museum would just be focused on the Korean War but it went into a lot more details on other historical battles waged by long ago Kings  Outside there were a number of memorial statues as well as a large assortment of aircraft rockets and fighting vehicles that you could get up close to and peer inside A number of the armored personnel carriers were open but you could not go in Sets of stairs were brought next to a cobra helicopter so you could see inside the cockpit The PKM357 ship from the 2002 Battle of Yeonpyeong is displayed here with red paint detailing every area damaged during the battle This was the only display where you were allowed to climb onboard and see the bridge deck and guns up close and learn more about the battle that killed South Korean seamen  As I walked up to the entrance there were a number of black pillars dedicated to the UN and other countries that came to South Koreas defense during the Korean War In addition along the walkways to the side of the main entrance were large plaques with all of the names of soldiers from around the world who died in the war It was a lot of recognition and honor  Once I entered the museum it turned out to be a lot larger than I anticipated The bottom floor contained details about each kingdoms armies and battles and went into size arms skills and success In the central courtyard were wooden replicas of early Korean warships The top two floors went into extensive review of the Korean War with 4D movies dioramas and artifacts Additional planes limosines and arms were also displayed  Unfortunately I ran out of time but one could easily spend 23 hours here,Positive,-0.9886,Negative
363,5.0,The outside memorials are in my opinion the best part of the whole thing The statues and installations are very moving and well designed Inside the Korean War exhibits are very well put together and take you through each year of the war the help received by various countries and the contexts of the war My only critique would be that they seem to microscopically criticize the north in every facet while never accepting or elaborating on any of the shortcomings the south may have had In brief a broader and less biased history would have helped to understand the nuances of the war a little bit more  The memorial is free Which is awesome for budget travelers Near the entrance you can find huge walls with all the names of the victims from each respective country that died in the Korean War so that was also very special Its nice to see the recognition showed by Korea to every country that tried to help them If youre interested there are also war machines out in the front of the memorial with vehicles such as tanks and a big war ship,Positive,-0.7357,Negative
364,3.0,When youre interested in Korean history this museum is a must visit However I found it a bit dull The information was presented very simple without any extras  I think I expected more information about the course of the war The information could have been presented way more interactive or with some items to go with it,Negative,-0.5994,Negative
365,5.0,A beautiful interactive display of history that gives you opportunity to understand the importance of what it means to fight for your freedom War is scary but this gives the opportunity to be guided through history to understand the changes and development of people during the sone of worst decades in world history To see war bring together the most unlikely and war torn countries together to fight for the freedom of others and rebuilding of others Its an amazing,Positive,-0.7351,Negative

367,4.0,We came after lunch to the War Memorial It has excellent programs that explain the war and the international coalition that brought the North KoreanRussianChinese forces to armistice There are lots of details for those who love details and it is easy to choose what to focus on and what to pass on There is lots of English interpretation unlike some other museums in Korea and many beautiful sculptural tributes to the many soldiers who gave their lives Korea lost just over 170000 soldiers and God knows how many civilians Just over 10000 Americans died There is no entry fee there are a number of good video programs and there is a coffee shop if you suffer from museum eyes after a while For Americans especially I think this is a good way to understand something of the very special bond that exists between Koreans and Americans One thing it could do better is to illustrate the cultural rifts between North and South that existed for centuries before the conflict This dividing line is not just a creature of the Cold War Coming during the week would be a good idea We were there on a Thursday afternoon and found plentiful parking Id certainly go again,Positive,0.8173,Positive
368,5.0,Great free museum about conflict on and over the Korean peninsula from ancient to modern times I spent 25 hours here and still didnt see read everything A wonderful mix of multimedia movies actual USROK and captured equipment wax museum like staging and other artifacts If I get back I would visit again and review from current 3rd floor to ancient times 1st floor Save some time for outdoor equipment,Positive,0.9382,Positive

371,4.0,As I had some free time left in Seoul the War Memorial seemed a good place to visit as a followup to visiting the DMZ Although Im not really interested in military history I found an impressive and informative range of displays on the history of war on the Korean Peninsula and an expression of hope for the future To be honest I found it all a little unsettling but its very well presented and there is an area for kids to learn the history Theres also a wideranging display of military aircraft tanks missiles etc that you can get up close to Worth a visit even if military history isnt your thing Free entry,Positive,0.5572,Positive
372,5.0,I visited this as a last minute decision heard the announcement on the hoponhopoff bus and figured I would check it out It turned out to be a good decision The museum is very modern and well organized with a lot more exhibits than I ever expected There are 3 floors inside with exhibits from the Korean conflict as well as details of the Korean Militarys contributions to other endeavours such as the Vietnam Conflict Very well done The thing that really impressed me was the outdoor exhibit with US ROK and Soviet weapons many of which I hadnt seen before It is quite a size and includes a B52 and an entire Patrol Gunboat As a final touch many of the tanks are surrounded by lovely flowers which somehow seems appropriate for a hope for peace There was no admission charge,Positive,0.9311,Positive

376,5.0,This is quite amazing Its free and it tells the story of war through the ages there are lots to look at and many movies explaining the history of the Korean empire It tells every aspect of the story even the peace keeping aspect of the Korean military I was very moved by the memorials outside the museum thanking the different nations helping the people of South Korea,Positive,0.8576,Positive
377,1.0,Wellit definitely IS a WAR museum I found it simply obnoxious We were led into a movie play which encountered me to be more like a counter strike video game It was a 4d movie Sitting there and watching the invasion of Incheon through a soldiers eye ok not my idea of a \xe2\x80\x9ewar museum\xe2\x80\x9cthat is supposed to be dealing with the terror of war but when these soldiers started to fire at their own but north korean people I was just simply shocked I have never ever seen such an impiety before It all reached its peak when some american tourists wanted to start clapping at the end of the \xe2\x80\x9eshow\xe2\x80\x9c But they wouldnt dare to as we all looked shocked and pissed and wouldnt want to clap The rest of this museum is ok but it rarely displays the terror of war it even more glorifies it It took me a few days to get rid of this disgusted feeling when I left the museum Its more like US Propaganda,Negative,-0.9792,Negative
378,5.0,Spent the morning there and its a must to see Its wonderfully kept for you to wander around and take in the past It brings it home to you what South Korea went through and how many countries were involved It also reminds you that it was one of the poorest countries after the war and how far it has come now,Positive,-0.5423,Negative

380,4.0,Very well done war museum that tells the story of all of the wars Korea has faced in its history But for Western visitors its sufficient to focus here solely on the exhibition dedicated to the Korean War Its a great place to learn about the war that essentially brought the Republic of Korea to where it is today Definitely worth a short visit,Positive,0.0693,Positive

384,5.0,This is a massive museum providing information about wars and military strategy throughout the history of Korea and now South Korea While an English Language tour was provided it started out focusing intensely in terms of time invested on the Korean War which I suppose is what most English speakers want to know about We were hoping for more of an overview of the museum so we left the group early It took us 2 hours to see the entire museum quickly All signage is in English,Positive,-0.6293,Negative

435,5.0,Im not joking when I say that This place doubles as both a military museum with dozens of exhibit tanks helicopters aircraft and ships that make military history nerds like myself giggle with glee and a grand sombre memorial to the events that literally shaped the founding of the nation The exhibits chronicle Koreas history of invasion by foreign states its drive for selfdetermination and its fight to survive against its northern neighbour in the Korean War of 195053 The exhibits make many boasts of how the nation must be strong to ensure its safety but they never stray anywhere near nationalist or jingoistic themes If anything they serve to underscore the true destruction that war brings and that whilst it is never wrong to fight for the right cause the experience of war itself is something that should never be venerated or glorified  I spent almost 3 hours here  one completely lost in the maze of the vehicle yard outside and the other 2 in the gargantuan memorial building itself It was easy to navigate and although admission was free I made a donation at the end of my visit because of how immensely impressed I was with the experience If youre in Seoul and want to get a better understanding of South Koreas recent history this is something you cannot miss,Positive,0.9165,Positive

496,5.0,We spent a week in Seoul and I would rate the War Memorial my favorite attraction South Korea really went all out on this  no expense was spared I have been to other worldclass war museums such as the War Museum in London and the Artillery Museum in St Petersburg Russia  but Seouls War Memorial tops them all  Before one enters the main complex of the Memorial one passes through an immense park packed with military hardware and statues  There are several floors within the museum  which is free by the way There are several theaters that display either holograms or 3D presentations My favorite was a theater that was cooled down to about 2 degrees C with snow on the ground The narrator of the 3D presentation is a Korean war veteran who relates that one of the most difficult aspects of the mountainous warfare was the temperature factor  and to reenforce this snow is blown into your face  It is clear that the Korean War is remembered to this day in South Korea with great vividity and the museum emphasizes Koreas commitment to UN peacekeeping operations The presentday tense situation with North Korea is refected in exhibitions within the museum to emphasize that the horrors of the last war could manifest themselves again  The first floor of the museum boasts fullscale replicas of ancient Korean warships and depictions of Koreans earlier war history in Asia,Positive,-0.9633,Negative

507,4.0,This was the first place we visited when we arrived in Seoul as it was just a 10 minutes walk from where we were staying Because we arrived late we rushed through the exhibits but we were taken aback by the incredible history it documents It should be specially interesting for children The multimedia use is quite effective and at places you might need to pause We came back from there wanting to learn more about the history of South and North conflict and Japanese occupation,Positive,0.7343,Positive

515,5.0,The War Memorial Of Korea was amazing We learnt a great deal by navigating the many floors that boasted with tons of history Each step gave ample information about the wars that South Korea endured with its neighbors especially the war with Japan China and North Korea This visit made me realize the great success that South Korea has achieved in this small window of time The wars have made it stronger better and very successful I couldnt get enough Just Wonderful Go Korea,Positive,0.9289,Positive

518,4.0,This memorial is definitely worth a visit A great display including interactive and old film footage,Positive,0.8271,Positive
519,3.0,The Korean War Memorial is a large imposing building near Samgakji metro station in an otherwise nondescript neighbourhood Its size is a testament to the centrality of the Korean war to the recent history and identity of the Republic of Korea and its troubled relationship to North Korea It is part shrine listing the names of the hundreds of thousands of South Korean and UNallied servicepeople who died in the war part museum giving detailed accounts of the war and part a propaganda organ shouting the Souths version of the conflict Despite the importance of its subject it is far too detailed even for a visitor  a military historian  who knows a bit about the war I saw two young Australian women who were enduring a detailed guided tour who plainly did not really want the detail they were being given A lot of the presentations deal with aspects of military operations of course and the audiovisual programs are often hard to understand The display outside the museum of military hardware is frankly underwhelming unless you really do want to see and climb into every variety of armoured personnel carrier that the South Korean army has ever used The galleries generally lack the element of the personal stories now obligatory in most military museums The presentation of the place which has been open for about 25 years is looking a bit tired eg the moat has been drained but its certainly worth visiting showing the impact of the Korean war on the country while the long corridors of names on the roll of honour which doesnt include the couple of million civilians the war killed is sobering,Negative,-0.984,Negative

583,3.0,Its a weird scene a lot of onesided displays some really cool military hardware juxtaposed against mobs of schoolchildren all over the place Not really schoolchildren were talking barely kindergartners if that oddly posing with cartoon characters right next to massive bombers and such  Inside there was a memorial service for a hero of the Korean War killed in 1953 complete with wreaths speakers and many modernday military officers sitting and standing in attention in full regalia  Nearby a group of toddlers posed by a picture of an island that Korea currently disputes with Japan I dont speak Korean but the teacher was prodding them to raise their little fists in the air and shout something triumphalsounding so they could all take a group photo presumably proclaiming their solidarity with Koreas claim to the island Its a little scary Im not used to seeing preschool children being actively indoctrinated quite so overtly at quite such a tender age even in countries where youd think that kind of stuff goes on  The museum is free its huge theres a lot to see captivating propaganda for sure But propaganda nonetheless,Negative,0.5627,Positive

592,5.0,I didnt know that much about the Korean war except having watched every episode of MASH for instance I hadnt realised that just over a thousand British servicemen were lost thats less than the Northern Ireland troubles and that over 30 thousand US servicemen were killed It was good to see that all countries that supplied servicemen and women were represented with a memorial and flag and a short description of their commitments I did enjoy the military equipment graveyard even the wife didnt complain My interest was piqued about the previous Japanese invasions of Korea having seen the displays of the turtle ships Ive now read several articles about these invasions Its well worth visiting the memorial if nothing else than paying your respects for our fallen countryman,Positive,-0.7763,Negative
593,5.0,Hey Dont be a loser Go to the memorial It has a totally sweetsauce outside section with planes and tanks that you can get into and take photos Tons of super cute kids running around doing cute stuff Cool boat that you can climb around on  The entrance to the inside has massive walls of all the names of fallen soldiers Tried to find people with my last name Couldnt Which was a bummer but also good  If you walk the inside direction backwards not only do you get a lot of \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a idiot looks\xe2\x80\x9d but also it feels like you are traveling back in time  You can only bar hop and eat food so many hours in a day and with that 2 hour break come here  A,Positive,0.8584,Positive

601,4.0,Much more than a war memorial that part us actually the less interesting one  huge museum with many exhibits not just on the Korean War but also all aspects of Korean military history throughout the ages Lots of military hardware on display and most exhibits have English captions though often abbreviated The Korean conflict was narrated from the South Korean perspective naturally which can be interesting and rather different from the version seen in the literature on the war in tEnglish Parts of the museum are a bit run down and the displays are perhaps not always illuminating Nonetheless really not to be missed for those with an interest in this field,Positive,-0.4753,Negative
602,4.0,Quite an amazing place Amazed to see such a selection of aeroplanes tanks rockets and even a boat But then the memorial with all the names of those who died together with the complete history of the war is very solemn Well worth visiting,Positive,-0.5701,Negative

604,5.0,Definitely a place to visit when in Seoul The admission is free and the museum has something for everyone  Outside there are several airplanes and tanks to observe Each one has a sign explaining what it was used for during the war Near the ship there is a 3D movie representing what it was like to be in a fighter jet  Inside the museum the displays are very respectful and detailed There are several texts to read and short movies to watch It explains very well the war and outcome of Korea  It is possible to spend an hour as it is possible to spend all day at this location,Positive,0.7172,Positive

857,5.0,Its no secret that a proxy albeit very costly war was fought across both halves of the Korean peninsula in the 1950s Its also needs no big stretch of the imagination that the truce could be irreversibly broken again at any time due to the diametrically opposed political beliefs of the North and South Korean governments With this as the background this rather grandiose building at least at first glance might appear to serve as a temple to the glories or war True there are many exhibits that come across as unreservedly nationalistic and play on the werethegoodies and theyrethebaddies mentality But delve beneath the surface of the exhibits and there are many instances where the suffering of the Korean people is a central theme of a deeper desire for reunification  Theres a lot to keep the visitor occupied and for military enthusiasts its best to keep at least a halfday free In fact the memorial portion of the building is actually quite small compared to the Korean War displays with plenty of mention of United Nations especially American contributions that take up a couple of floors in one wing Other interesting sections include one on the local armed forces more recent skirmishes between the two Koreas as well as one on warfare during the Joseon period circa late14th to late19th centuries Displays range from old sailing vessels to cannons to military hardware Indeed military hardware from the 20th century takes up an enormous external parklike space adjacent to the memorial building and could easily require over an hour to do it proper justice  The easiest subway station is Samgakji serviced by lines 4 and 6 from where its an easy 5minute walk to the entrance gates of the Memorial,Positive,0.9776,Positive

867,5.0,This is a review for both the memorial and the museum which should really be considered one  First off the memorial itself was beautiful and powerful The statues really give a sense of the struggles of the past and even the present day split between the people of Korea  Secondly the museum allows you to see all sorts of historical jets tanks weapons armor etc etc that youd be hard pressed to find elsewhere Truly a fantastic experience for any fan of military history Theres also a lot of history from before the Korean war in the memorial you can even see a replica of a Korean turtle ship  When I visited in May they even had a performance that happened right outside the museum They had various martial arts performances followed by a marching performance done by all four branches of the Korean Armed Forces Quite a sight to behold  Also its free I dont see why anyone would miss this unless history completely bores you,Positive,0.7102,Positive

968,5.0,The war memorial is so great I learned so much about korea and the war Its big beautiful very well made and its free Make sure to take a tour The tour is for free they offer it at the enterance The tour guides are not just tour guides they are very knowledgeable and passionate Our english tour guide was a army veteran had served for 20years He asked us where we were from and what did we want from the tour He personlized the tour for us gave us big picture and related canadian and indian role to the war  since we are indo canadians,Positive,0.9135,Positive
969,3.0,I was impressed with the well thought architecture the meticulous effort in detail and variety of displays of the Korean war and the informative history of the Korean warfare I could feel a sincere homage paid to UN forces that helped defend South Korea  However it could have been better if it also showed more about North Korean and Chinese young souls who were dragged into the war at the time of emerging Cold War era and it should have been millions of civilian victims and divided families that must be in the center of focus in the tragedy instead of glorifying war heroes  It is more of a museum for war heroes and less of a memorial for war victims,Negative,-0.9432,Negative
970,3.0,We came expecting a poignant memorial to the Korean war It is not this at all and if I was reviewing it was a memorial I do not think it is very good at all This is a museum dedicated to the Korean War  Outside the memorial there are plenty of military planes tanks and missiles This sums up the internal exhibits It is a subjective look at the war You do learn a lot about a war that was effectively a world war one that killed millions in just 6 months and then another million in the two years of negotiations  Other exhibits include a military look at Korean History with dioramas There are free guided tours where the volunteer can explain the Korean War in detail We were lucky and had a History student who was able to discuss the political discourse with us  The one area that was dedicated to peace seemed very tacky to me and I felt it didnt commemorate the memory of those who died It was a room with faux tombstones that had battles projected on to them  If you come expecting a museum of war then this is a good place to spend a few hours learning a bit about the Korean war If you come expecting a museum of peace and commemoration then like me you will be disappointed I do think it was a bit too brazen and glorified the fighting a too much but then most museums about war seem to  It is free and is close to the subway You just need to walk around the American base to get here,Negative,-0.861,Negative

972,5.0,Very informative with lots of awesome artifacts I tried my luck and asked if there was any guided tour in English The counter staff assigned a 14 year old schoolboy volunteer to bring me around Really thankful for that It took about 30 minutes and i found out that he was actually on school vacation but he signed up as a Englishspeaking museum guide on his own Good lad After the tour i went back in for a 2nd look as i wanted to take photos  Tip  1 If you have limited time your itinerary should be 2nd floor Korea War then 3rd floor UN then on to the 1st floor Medieval warfare  2 If you arrive late in the day the outdoor display of war machines should be viewed last as they are outside the museum So in the event of the museum closure you can still venture outside among the machines The highlight for me was the replica I think of a Scud missile,Positive,-0.5932,Negative

981,4.0,While living in Korea for three years my return visit with my mom was my first time here Autumn brought in a melancholic pretty and quiet atmosphere in the place Part of the exhibit in the lobby was the commemorative display naming all the Cheonan ship soldiers who died in the sinking and I thought it was sad beautiful  considerate Im not sure of the right word  and fitting to include them in the museum We were hoping to find my grandfathers  my immediate and his cousins  name as part of the first contingent who went to Korea during the war It was only later on that we realized only the Koreans names were included poor research our bad Nonetheless it was a good eye opener about Koreas history the invasions the wars  it explained a lot of what and how Korea came to be; in culture thinking perspectives  As we were leaving the museum we had this wonderful surprise of the soldiers doing a presentation of sorts  I forgot the festival My mother as a humanities professor enjoyed the show very much despite not understanding the narration It was a pleasant surprise and we enjoyed every bit of our visit in and outside the premises,Positive,0.9248,Positive

983,5.0,Husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this museum The indoor museum had more than just exhibits on the Korean War There were war exhibits from Koreas medieval period as well The corridors with lists of names of soldiers who died in the Korean War were well laid out and had a sense of serenity to it The outdoor museum was where the display of military vehicles was located You are allowed to see the displays up close and even explore the insides of some of the vehicles Even though I am not Korean and not a warmilitary enthusiast I found this place thoroughly enjoyable and is an honorable tribute to the fallen soldiers  My only regret was not getting to the museum earlier We arrived about 2 hours before closing time and had taken our time in the memorial corridor looking at the names of soldiers Hence we were unable to cover all floors of the indoor museum before closing time In hindsight we should have gone straight to the indoor museum and covered that first since we were able to take our time looking at the outdoor exhibits after museum closing time,Positive,-0.8087,Negative

989,5.0,I love history I have always loved history When I was a student in elementary and high school I always dedicated extra time to my history books; I wanted to understand why things are the way they are While studying abroad in college I found it fascinating that other countries tell the same story but with a different perspective After that revelation I have always enjoyed my history books in foreign countries and in foreign languages and learning new things about any given event It is fascinating to read about the SpanishAmerican war IN SPAIN And it seems an alternate universe to read about the USA in any given European Asian or Latin American country Thus I was prepared for revelations and new information the moment we entered the facility First the museum is free to all visitors; second it is a selfguided tour; you take a brochure and map and view things at your own pace The light and sound shows are well done and not overly exaggerated which would have reduced their message There are a couple that require a minimum of 5 people to begin We missed a couple because we were just 4 people  A word of caution however this museum is about all Korean wars not just the last one You will spend some time in 5th century feuding kingdoms see the play off between the Tang dynasty and Japan and the Mongol hordes over the next thousand years What once were 3 kingdoms with double the land area eventually contracted to one kingdom near the end of the 19th century before the Japanese invasion And then finally the full thrust and import to foreigners the events leading up to and including the Korean war 1950 to 1953  We all learned as high school students that the rapid removal of American troops and Secretary Achesons definition of Korea as outside the American defense perimeter after World War II contributed to the boldness on the part of the north to launch the war We didnt learn that North Korean leadership asked for permission from both the Soviet Union and China before launching their attack on the south and other interesting facts that did not come to light until after the collapse of the Soviet Union opened all those secret archives But the most interesting points to me were the minor one off events that became determining points in the war What if the ROK forces had not blown up the bridges over the Han River halting the Norths Russian tank advance for 6 days time enough for Truman to get troops to territory still held by ROK forces What if MacArthur had not gambled on a surprise landing at Incheon leading to the collapse of North Korean supply lines and the rapid retreat of the invasion force all the way back to the Chinese border What if the Chinese hadnt been so worried about an American ally on its border and hadnt entered the war What if Truman had authorized use of the ABomb So many what ifs to consider a dedicated student of history will find many such small but highly decisive events to ponder  I highly recommend this museum They say history is written by the victors and in the same way a people tell of their successes they often gloss over their failures and their shames I respect the Korean people immensely for coming to grips just over 10 years ago with the infamous 1950 summer of terror for not whitewashing what happened during that early tragic phase of the war Unfortunately I did not find that reference at this museum,Positive,-0.9838,Negative
990,4.0,My mother came to visit me and is loves history This is a place she really wanted to visit I am so glad we did The place is huge Statues and old war machines are surrounding the building Inside you get to see old war vessels information about past wars in Korea with interesting artifacts from those time periods Then as you go through you get to the korean war that separated North and South It was emotional You see countries that aided Korea and their heroes They recently added on a new section that used all the dog tags from the fallen soldiers and they made it in to a tear drop Its a dark room where drops of water form on the floor using projector and then the floor comes alive with tags falling with names on them It was beautiful There is so much to see and do in this museum that we ran out of time I am going back soon I want to finish exploring this beautiful museum,Positive,0.7695,Positive

1002,5.0,We went to the War Memorial of Korea because we were told it was interesting That was an understatement it was not just interesting it was brilliant and after many hours we had to leave after seeing only the outside and 1st Floor displays We are definitely going back next time Korea has a long history of internal strife and aggressive invasion by other countries  The displays reflect all aspects of its turbulent past,Positive,0.7351,Positive

1004,5.0,It was US Memorial Day and the family decided to visit the Korean War Memorial Unfortunately they are closed on Monday We were able to walk the grounds There are plenty of planes and other military hardware on display We also walked the halls with all the names of those who gave everything for the freedom of Koreans One hall was all Korean heroes and the other hall listed the names by United Nations countries that contributed during the conflict Well go back when we can take the tour English tours are at 1000 and 1400 Tuesday through Sunday,Positive,0.5859,Positive
1005,4.0,This memorial is comprehensive assembly of the military history of Korea and tribute to the veterans The best parts of the museum are those devoted to the Korean war At times I wish it had gone deeper into the history and the sequence of battles You can spend about as long at the museum as you like if you really dig into all the stories and testimonies That said sometimes those testimonies are shallow and lack detail Some knowledge of the sequence of the battles in the Korean war certainly helps one to appreciate the different displays It is a bit disjointed in its presentation in that some parts seem to be chronologically out of sequence You do get a real sense of the feeling of violation to be invaded by a hostile neighbor and the sacrifice that was made which at times appeared to be a losing cause fortunately it did not end that way In that sense the memorial is an effective tribute Outside it has a very extensive collection of military hardware including tanks and aircraft This site is easily reached by subway and food is available on site,Positive,0.296,Positive
1006,5.0,With so many good reviews I wasnt sure I could add value with one more but I do think there are a couple important points First it is not a Korean War Memorial and by that I mean it is not just about what westerners think of as the Korean War It is a memorial to many more battles and wars going back thousands of years Second the admission is free and there are free guided tours as well When we went there were two options for a free tour at 10 AM  the official one and one given by a volunteer from Visit Seoul Walking Tours We chose the volunteer At first we wondered if we made the right choice since his English was not quite as good as the official guide but he gave us a longer more indepth and quite a personal tour If you are pressed for time go with the official tour If you have the time go with the volunteer guide,Positive,0.9752,Positive

1011,5.0,This comprehensive museum really helps understanding the unique history as well as the backround of the present day circumstances in Korean peninsula While presenting the history from the South Korean point of view the museum manages to be neutrally informative instead of giving a propagandistic view of any of the participants at any given time We happened to visit the museum before the trip to the DMZ and I totally recommend this particular order since youll be equipped with so much more basic knowledge to get the most out of the DMZ visit,Positive,0.8803,Positive

1013,5.0,Very interesting and plenty of things to see In the begining I was a bit lost because I though there was not enough English translation but as you move on things become clear and well documented I felt like it was really worth to go I learned a lot I spent there almost 3 hours including a snack break There was no entrance free,Positive,0.9335,Positive
1014,5.0,I missed this last time I was in Seoul but managed to make it this time and very happy I did This is a wonderful respectful memorial to the many people and countries that participated in the Korean War All displays are multilingual English speakers will have no problems participating or reading any of the displays I spent about two hours there but could have spent more There are lots of exhibits and items on display from small bullets all the way to a B52 They have items from both sides so you get a very good idea of what the forces on both sides had available There also displays from Koreas early history that were interesting The entire museum outside and inside is free and appears to be very accessible to those with special needs Look for the elevator signs on the exterior and that will take you the main floor Once there you will also find elevators to take you to each floor There is ample room in the display areas if you are in a wheel chair or on crutches It is very friendly in that sense There is a small gift shop mostly for kids and cafe in the museum if you need a quick snack If you drive there is underground parking available I cant forget to mention that it is a memorial and it is tastefully done I was impressed by the panels placed in the exterior wings that honored all of the deceased allies The names were listed by country and the US deceased were listed alphabetically by name and state The list includes servicemen from the US commonwealths as well so Puerto Rico etc Were also there Beneath each panel there was a fresh white carnation which I was told is replaced everyday Very nice touch and contributed to the solemnity of this area Another very nice touch is the huge sign across from the memorial that says Thank you United Nations for your help and then shows the flags of every country that sent combatants and non combatants to support the South Koreans I liked this a lot and will go again,Positive,0.9972,Positive
1015,5.0,I thought I would not enjoy this place and just went for husbands sake Did not include this place first time I visited Korea Glad we did this time as I enjoyed learning about history a well as the actual footages taken during the war and shown as videos I also loved the computerassisted presentations simulating the war Actual war plane chopper boats are also displayed at the entrance of the museum I highly recommend including this in your itinerary,Positive,-0.0606,Negative

1019,4.0,The Korean war memorial is a deifinite visit though it feels a little off putting knowing that it is surrounded by American military bases and the westerner district it gives you the sense that this may not really be as Korean as you might believe The pieces are exquisite and the layering of pieces is amazing as you start at the bottom in the ancient era and ascend to the modern The Korean war section is excellent though filled with tons of propoganda and from that point on you feel as if the museum is slowly turning into one giant recruitment strategy but aside from this biasis nature you are in for a treat as you Korean history come to life,Positive,0.5267,Positive

1022,5.0,This place definitely deserves the 1 spot on Seouls list of attractions  it is brilliant I had a limited amount of time so I focused my attention on the three rooms dedicated to the Korean War There is so much to see and do inside and the exhibits are so hightech One of the things that amazed me was the amount of audiovisual material and all of it gave you the option of watching the videos with subtitles in either English Korean Chinese or Japanese One scene that I was perusing featured four soldiers filling their water bottles at a river and when I pressed the button a holograph appeared animating one of them  I didnt see all of the memorial but the information provided about the Korean War was detailed and compelling and I felt quite educated when I left When I return to Seoul there is no if about it  the city is amazing and I cant wait to visit again I intend to head back to the War Memorial and see the rest of it Considering it was a free attraction I was amazed by how brilliant it was Definitely not to be missed,Positive,0.9762,Positive
1023,5.0,Now i know why this is ranked number 1 This memorial is more like a museum with massive ranges of history from all around the globe There are also amazing displays of weapons machinery and everything you can basically think of from rockets to battleships The outdoor part of the memorial is a football field sized area with tanks planes rockets and various artillery weapons This War Memorial would probably be number 1 in the world is amazing,Positive,0.2006,Positive

1107,5.0,This place has it all Covering the early paleolithic days of Korea right up to the modern day there is nothing about Korean civilization and its various wars that is overlooked Inside youll find all the expected exhibits with uniforms guns maps recreations etc Outside though there is a massive array of planes tanks missiles and even ships Be sure to seek shelter under the B52 for a spell if the Seoul summer heat becomes too much The statues and parade ground are a nice touch as well Overall this is a mustsee if you want to get a general grasp of Korea at war,Positive,-0.2732,Negative
1108,5.0,To give priority once you get inside this vast building are the three rooms of the Korean War on the second  third floors to put in perspective the entire display area of each of the Hiroshima  Nagasaki Abomb museums Im quite sure can almost be fit into just one of the three rooms upstairs here where youll learn or actually almost relive the Korean War among impressive displays of quiterealistic looking wax sculptures especially liked how those 3D displays kind of blend in with the big background scenes behind them; you might have a hard time looking at your own pics later to tell which of the images are sculptures  which are part of the background scene such as those of soldiers crossing the 38th Parallel General Douglas MacArthur at a table with the first South Korean President a soldier raising the South Korean flag in front of their Capitol building children learning at a makeshift school outdoors and some reconstruction being done by civilians  soldiers with a background scene of the devastated city  all of which in my opinion are really wellthoughtout displays that portray some of the important aspects  moments of the war as vividly as possible And to top off your almost reliving experience of the war be sure to catch the 4D show in one of the two rooms either the Room I or the Room II on the second floor  an absolutely outstanding though only for about 10 minutes documentary of the famous Incheon Landing that decisively turned the tide of the war with the great opening line I am General Douglas MacArthur and I will bring hammer upon anvil and yes I can guarantee an upclose experience of sights  sounds of that landing as you can naturally expect from a 4D show the sounds of bombardment  such will be loud  The first floor though if youre pressed for time they close at 6 pm after the great rooms upstairs is where you can kind of walk through since theres not much to learn at the General War History room with like prototype soldier  equipment displays of some Western nations as well but no theme of a particular war as the rooms upstairs and theres the dark room for memorial purposes which is just meant to kind of pay respect  pass through; and for some ancient history theres the big time line of Korea all the way from like AD 100 the big painting of a battle scene of a preJoseon time which is actually lit up on  off for different parts of the painting my favorite display on the entire first floor and a replica of the famed Admiral Yi Sun Shins turtle boat a smaller replica Im sure though than the actual turtle boat  And outside the building be sure to get to the right side of the grounds the right side as youre facing the building or equivalently to your left after coming out of the building where there are quite a number of military vehicles for land sea  air some tanks with really long cannons that I noticed; for the sea specifically though is only one big boat but it can be gone up on board where theres a 5minute documentary of a naval incident that actually took place not too long ago shown in 4D just like the Incheon Landing documentary inside the building as mentioned above And apart from those military vehicles there are two big sets of sculptures I believe one set represents the South  the other represents the North with a tall monument between them on one end of the grounds right by the street actually straight from the building entrance on the other end and a twobrothers statue on like a lagoon maybe supposedly a hill can be entered but nothing much inside on the left side of the grounds the left side as youre facing the building or equivalently to your right after coming out of the building which is the opposite side of the grounds from the military vehicles Also just outside the building entrance on each side are big plates with names of soldiers who died in the war similar to the big wall at the UN Cemetery in Busan although the names here are on individual plates and not on a wall  Coming by subway Samgakji Station on Lines 4  6 is where to get off followed by just about a 5minute walk and youll be at the twobrothers statue; just do keep in mind it takes about 4 hours in total for both inside  outside and the 6 pm closing time and I do suggest as mentioned above to start with the three rooms of the Korean War on the second  third floors; the outside can be done even after the closing time actually except maybe for going up the boat,Positive,0.4359,Positive

1119,4.0,Large and well worth visiting and provide substantial information on wars which have plagued Korea since the earliest recorded times It would be better named as a Museum than a Memorial I guess exhibits such as the Incheon Landing 4D ride are worthwhile for engaging teenagers but more emphasis should be on helping people to reflect what has caused war in the past and how to avoid future wars,Positive,-0.8316,Negative

1249,5.0,The Korean War memorial is a massive site dedicated to those that fought and gave their lives to defend South Korea from communist North Korea and China The displays are awesome and the sculptures capture the struggles both South Korean soldiers and civilians endured throughout the war We saw hundreds of young military soldiers and students at the memorial probably to learn about the war and why they need to stay vigilant to protect their freedom Its remarkable how much South Koreans suffered during the war and how they rebuilt their nation to what it is today in just 63 years The memorial will forever remind future generations of the price of freedom You must visit this remarkable site,Positive,0.5267,Positive

1251,4.0,Its free to visit so why not stop by Even if you just go for the walk around of the mostly Korean War equipment pieces they have on display outdoors its worth the 12 hour alone  One complaint if you will is the thin amount of material on the Korean War I know there are 3 entire rooms devoted to it but in actuality there isnt all that much  outside of the vast equipment on display outside   For a country so war torn in its long history a visit here gives one perspective and appreciation for what they have gone thru and with the help out outside nations retained minus of course the northern half of the country,Positive,-0.5759,Negative
1252,5.0,The entire museum is pretty great Our kids loved the outdoor stuff and childrens museum There are weird height requirements for the childrens area but we took our baby and let him play around even though he wasnt tall enough They didnt seem to mind Our other kids enjoyed it a lot They only let you in for 50 minute periods that start watching hour and when its busy you may have to wait to get in but we went on a weekend morning and it was empty,Positive,0.9022,Positive

1257,5.0,I only had 175 hours there which wasnt enough Id recommend at least 3 hours Entry is free The tanks planes including a B52 missiles etc outside of the museum can be seen after the museum closes so save them for last  I enjoy my history but this museum still had plenty of interesting information to offer on the Korean war It also covers ALL Korean wars from ancient times through to todays military but the Korean war takes up a lot of real estate as a three part exhibit give yourself a couple hours for the Korean war exhibit if you have high interest  Some of the exhibits are interactive or moving plus there is some sound and cinema to make it a more interesting experience  If you enjoy history at all you cant miss this museum,Positive,-0.3881,Negative
1258,5.0,An interesting place you can get a glimpse into south Koreas past From the ancient eras to the Korean war Didnt know that the nation went thru such difficult timesReally interesting exibits on display From ancient battleship war gear to modern tanks and bullets Its amazing It also showcases old antique pieces donated by those who took part in the war The whole place is HUGE Didnt know that a war could be so sadistic,Positive,-0.7886,Negative
1259,5.0,I have been to the Armed Forces Museum in Taipei Taiwan before and compared to that I must say that the War Memorial of Korea is really huge It is conveniently located next to either Namyeong Station or Noksapyeong Station The museum can be a good addition as a next stop afterwards if you have a prior Koridoor DMZ or JSA tour since the Koridoor office is very close to Namyeong Station itself  The indoor section of the museum itself consists of 3 floors of various exhibits from the ancient period such as the Three Kingdoms of Korea to the modern day Of course the highlights in the exhibits are heavily focused on the Korean War which is often known as the Forgotten War due to the more well known Vietnam War overshadowing it There are plenty to see within the exhibits such as firearms uniforms and scale models of military vehicles Sometimes there are also special exhibits that are shown for a limited time In our case the museum held a special exhibition regarding firearms used by actors or actresses in Korean films It was very fascinating to see rather unique firearms closeup first hand  There is also the outdoor section of the museum which display various military vehicles artillery and aircraft and even a replica 11 scale of a South Korean patrol boat The amount of vehicles here is simply astonishing and well preserved You can see both Western and Soviet tanks and aircraft such as the M4 Sherman and T34 or even the massive B52 Stratofortress jet bomber You can even go into the back of the APCs such as the M113 for some memorable photos There is definitely plenty of stuff for everyone to take photos with  I would recommend at least 2 hours just to cover the inside of the museum itself and it is very ideal for a rainy day activity However do take note it is closed on Mondays though For those with an interest in military history or those who want to know more about the Cold War legacy that still continue to plague the Korean Peninsula this is a must go Best of all it is free,Positive,0.9509,Positive

1267,5.0,A tranqiul oasis in the city that is informative and also a memorial to those who suffered and those that helped  The War Memorial is a fitting tribute In my opinion it strikes the correct balance between being place of rememberance and a museum  park  tourist attraction it also provdes a history lesson and optimisim for the future  I spent about 3  4 hours wandeing about learned much that I did not already know There were people af all ages families and many nationalities there at the time of my visit but the place is large and well laid out so although there were many people nothing was crowded  The park is large and there are quite a lot of benches where you can rest in the shade and reflect  This is a place to visit that I would recommend anybody becase we can all learn and also be grateful that many of us never have had to be involved in such conflict  As is the case with many of the attractions the War Memorial is closed on Monday,Positive,0.25,Positive

1274,5.0,If you take any interest in the Korean war then this is a must Very good collection of military vehicles outside and the museum itself is an impressive structure and experience One of the best museums I have been to in terms of displays and information delivery The external halls pay homage to the fallen from the various nations  Pro Tip Even though it says 9am open come at like 81530 and see all the outside vehicle displays before the museum building opens to maximise your day and avoid the tourist crowds Expect to spend 3 hrs,Positive,0.8016,Positive
1275,5.0,Enjoyed this place tremendously The exhibits were very informative and gave me an idea of what it was like when Korea was at war Many pictures videos and relics  all of which provide new experiences of learning  The time you can spend here varies Personally I spent 4hrs here because Im the sort of person who reads and studies every single exhibit and stop to watch every show and video But there are some people who breeze and browse through quite quickly and could possibly finish everything in about an hour I guess it depends on what interests you  There was a 4D show in one of the exhibits on the 2nd level that illustrated the operations of the Incheon Landing That was rather impressive I thought By 4D I mean that you will be secured to your seat because the motion chairs move according to whether youre on a boat or a plane  Another thing that was really impressive was how you could use your smartphone to read more about the exhibits  either by NFC or QR scanning Beside the exhibits there would be a little panel for you to scan which would automatically open a page on your phone The page contained information about what you are seeing and would sometimes lead you to YouTube videos to illustrate it What a great way to learn  One of the must visit places if youre in to history,Positive,0.936,Positive
1276,5.0,After visiting the Memorial I am like most of the visitors would appreciate PEACE and FREEDOM more than ever This Memorial is so well done that I get to learn so much about Korean history and not just war We were very lucky to have a FREE GUIDED tour at 2pm check information for time which lasts for 15 hours You do not have to be a historian or weapon fanatic to find this place a great way to spend 48 hours there,Positive,0.9838,Positive

1282,5.0,For tourists in Seoul especially those from one of the 20 countries that participated in the Korean War this is a must see location The museum has free entry and several guided tours throughout the day Its really really large and even has several outside areas with old planes and ships Most of the museum focuses on the war in the 1950s but there is a section that talks about earlier conflicts as well It is a very moving place to visit especially if you have a personal connection with the conflict in some way I think it is good to visit early in your trip since so much of modern Korean society is a response to the Korean War,Positive,-0.8381,Negative
1283,5.0,Not only is the memorial amazing in terms of statues and old war vehicles but it is also in Iteawon which is a very cute neighborhood and has great food options from all over the world I would recommend going there after lunch spend the afternoon there and then have dinner down the road towards the metro tons of little shops if you are keen on that too,Positive,0.9555,Positive
1284,5.0,A lot of effort has been put in to this national museum Entry is free and one probably gains much more understanding than by a visit to The Border with the North It is in Seoul and easily accessible so no excuse not to visit for anyone with even the slightest interest in why Korea is the way it is today  The outside displays include an array of military hardware large enough to fight a small war collected from most of the nations which armed the 1950s conflict All including a full size B52 bomber shoehorned together in to a remarkably small area to make a massive 3D jigsaw The best view of all this is obtained from the deck of the heavily shell and bulletpitted gunboat which has found its way in to the ornamental lake in front of the buildings  All the nations flags and soldiers of the UN forces are commemorated in a huge memorial area  Koreans have a history of war to equal any European nation and this is outlined inside in an illustrated timeline covering several large rooms The internal displays include a horrific and moving portrayal of the Japanese occupation  We also saw many groups of South Korean school children all in their pretty uniforms being taken around the premises being introduced to the facts of Korean life and geopolitical circumstances Sad but essential,Positive,-0.1673,Negative

1372,5.0,Honestly I had no clue what to expect from this visit  I only seen pictures When you walk up to the museumwar memorial you are greeted with the sculpture of Two Brothers Already their story is an indication of what is to come  strong emotions coming from sculptures war equipment and finally the museum itself The sculptures in my eyes capture the different feelings of war perfectly from there you can walk to the war equipment used during the Korean War You walk along tanks airplanes ships and more  in the end there is also a museum that is more suited for children The museum itself is an experience On the bottom floor you have the general history of war in Korea and it adds to the understanding of this culture Slowly you walk towards the Korean War part and honestly it left a deep impression on me Two sentences in the museum stayed with me The noble sacrifice of heros who dedicated their lives to the country will be remembered forever as a ray of light  Freedom is not free Highly recommend this place,Positive,-0.3461,Negative

1439,4.0,This museum was a must visit for me  I have a different perspective as I have travelled to North Korea and visited THEIR war museum as well  I was very touched by the famous statue of the two brothers above a split globe  one South Korean and one North Korean The main walk to the museum is under repair so you must enter from the side I went through the left  I agree with the reviewer a few posts down that this museum paints the USA as god sent and while the North Korean war museum was definitely 100 propaganda this particular museum has its fair share as well research your subject matter see the exhibits and then make up your own mind  My favourite exhibit was undoubtedly the large Turtle Ship reimagination and replica as well as ancient battle armour and paintings  The displays are quite comprehensive and as an Aussie it was gratifying to pay my respects on the outside Australian memorial wall as well as seeing a fine collection of ANZAC displays  This museum is a must visit keep your mind open and be aware of what you are watching especially on the videos with energetic motivational music and short snippets of interviews  There is an area to make your own stamped and embossed souvenir postcard free of charge Also possibly the only openly displayed DPRK flag in Seoul is on the dummy replica of the armistice signing,Positive,0.9545,Positive

1443,4.0,I am a history buff Since I was a kid I really enjoyed reading things about military hardware and seeing them up close was very exciting for me It was some sort of a Disneyland or Universal Studios for me when I went to The War Memorial of Korea This was the first big war museum for me I was not disappointed because they have a big collection of equipment used during the Korean War such as tanks canons planes and even a patrol boat at the grounds of the museum That experience alone was satisfying enough for me and its free Good thing my wife and daughter allowed me to have this moment This sort of thing is more often appreciated by men and kids After viewing and photo ops outside we also went inside the museum You have to get a ticket to view the entire museum inside We decided not to buy a ticket because our time was limited We just visited some of the collection which was free to view We were also lucky at that time because there were some opera singers performing inside the museum and we were able to watch them for free  Going there we took the subway Samgakji Station You can also take the taxi but it depends on where you will be coming from  If you want to get an appreciation of what South Korea went through and how it is preparing to defend its present and future a visit to the Korea War Memorial is worth your while Make sure your wife and kids agree with you first If they do not want to go go by yourself,Positive,0.9447,Positive

1640,5.0,We spent 5 hours here and could have been longer Its an excellent museum The outside exhibits are fantastic and set in an area that is easy to navigate and extensive The only minus was the presence of the American elementary school They seemed to think the exhibits were a modified theme park they were noisy and disrepectful There was an international school who were well behaved and there was also an Korean school who were clealry there to learn but the American kids were simply there to shout and scream and Create a scene On the plus side there is a dedicated childrens museum and so we could shake them off  The inside exhibits were very much on a didactic model  tell EM What youre going to tell EM tell EM and tell tell EM again  but it simply works there are lots of exhibits and the assortment of media really adds to the story of the 195053 war The exhibits were a good combination of traditional and IT media Overall excellent  this should be a must when visiting Seoul as it explains the current psychi of the south Koreans and understanding that peace was never achieved  Its easy to navigate on the excellent metro  we went from city hall Only took about 20 mins in total  The metro is cheap and simple to get around   Personally I would allow at least 35 hours although we did much longer,Positive,0.9799,Positive

1914,4.0,The war memorial of Korea is a good way to spend a few hours of your time in Seoul The campus is quite large and there are many interesting exhibits outside and inside Entry to the museum is free There are 3 floors of exhibits and even though the first floor was closed for renovation when we visited we still spent over two hours inside reading and watching the movies The outside static displays of airplanes and tanks is very interesting as well although at the end of the day it seemed more like a playground for children instead of a part of a memorial It didnt ruin the experience for us but for some who prefer a quiet more reflective experience could be bothered I would recommend this museum if you are at all interested in military history or just want a free activity to enjoy for a day,Positive,0.9683,Positive
1915,5.0,Due to a very busy itinerary only visited this place for a few hours however could have easily spent a whole day here This museum is free to enter and offers a fantastic eye opening insight into the Korean war Static displays photos memorabilia along with film shows and 4D film shows along with a vast display of military equipment outside Incredible place,Positive,0.6597,Positive
1916,4.0,If you want to understand the context of the Korean Warwhich is foundational to understanding the North vs South tensionsthen you must visit this museum While presentations are not state of the art ie many are in the glass case approach to presentation there are some videos which give you an overall context to the war Now Im focused on this war for obvious current affairs reasons However this Museum covers their overall history of warfare  I would allow 2 hours if you are able to focus and not get side tracked,Positive,-0.7351,Negative

1919,5.0,Lets make it clear this is far more than a big statue of some soldiers Theres a huge museum behind them on three levels with huge collections of wartime military hardware on the outside plus rows of plaques dedicated to the names of soldiers who took part in and gave their lives in the name of a unified Korea  Its a struggle to really get this museum covered in a couple of hours If you have the stamina set aside about 45 hours for it including a break in the middle at the cafe If not come back another day if you have time Its free However if youre stuck for time have a look at the map and see what youd prefer to do  I personally enjoyed checking out the military hardware first Its very impressive and inside of the boat theres an inspiring if slightly overlybiased video about a recent naval skirmish between North and South Korea  Inside I very much enjoyed a walking tour of the war which covered the major events in great detail with touchscreens about all the battles available too It features mannequins of soldiers and other personnel involved in the conflict and a few videos including a very touching story told by an actual South Korean veteran about his feelings on the eve of what they thought would be a day of reunification but in fact was the day that the Chinese joined the conflict and pushed the ROK  UN Forces back down south  Theres also a very interesting section on the different countries which made up the UN forces which is well worth a look Plenty of countries took part in various roles many of them surprising Its really interesting  Particularly impressive are the number of lifesized recreations of various scenes from the war  As others have noted its quite biased against the North and very anticommunist  but you have to remember that this is a country still at war struggling with the reality that for many of them theres a strong sense of kinship with their apparent enemies to the North and for some theres family up there who may or may not still be alive To try to understand the complex emotions which come with this unique situation must be very difficult for a foreigner to do and I think its quite understandable that theres going to be some bias Despite this its really really visiting this memorial and museum You wont regret it,Positive,0.7398,Positive

1935,5.0,The War Memorial of Korea This was one of my favourite attractions that I visited in Seoul It tells of a very comprehensive history of Korea starting from the historical times As a history buff there were very detailed explanations of the ancient korean dynasties large scale models of weapons used in the past such as a huge turtle ship Then moving on to the other galleries it showcased the more recent past of korea including the Korean War There were also several 4D attractions that I visited within the memorial very very impressive Apart from the Korean War the galleries also showcased the recent acts of Aggression between the two Koreas The side wing also had a huge display of military vehicles and outside the Memorial there was a huge field where even more military assets were displayed even Missiles,Positive,0.2126,Positive
1936,3.0,The museum is mostly about the latest war between North and South Korea  It is propaganda style information and it is difficultimpossible to get the North angle of things  outside the museum is a huge amount of war machines  even a patrol boat with hundreds of bullet holes,Negative,-0.8176,Negative

1943,5.0,Finally visited this Memorial and Museum on my third visit to Seoul I wanted to make sure I allowed enough time to completely do it justice as I know it is a very large complex and other visitors have said they spent the better part of two days here  The hours of the memorial are 9a6p TuesSunday Closed Monday and Holidays Admission is free No free wifi unless you have an Olleh service planaccount Cafe on site and gift shop Nice bathrooms and water fountains Free lockers so you can stash your bagbackpack and easily accessible for wheel chair or strollers  When we arrived just before 10am we took a docent guided tour with Mr Jun a volunteer from Seoul City Hall The tour lasted approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes and he took us through the galleries pointing out the highlights and most important points of the Korean War He is very intelligent and speaks English very well The information he provided was concise and interesting It was a good introduction If you dont have hours to spend here I recommend taking a docentled tour to give you the highlights of the memorial and gallery exhibits Otherwise youll get too far into the weeds and run out of time before you get out of the first gallery  After the tour we went back through the galleries taking our time to read the captions and look at the artifacts and maps As this war occurred before my time and doesnt receive the emphasis in history classes in the US there is a lot we didnt know about the origins and details of the war The exhibits really filled in a lot of gaps and cleared up a lot of confusion Of course I understand this is the South Korean view of the war so I know theres just a little bit of propaganda  The highlights are the multiple films you can watch There are a total of 4 films Two are 4D where you wear 3D glasses and there are special effects like movement or snow one is 3D and one is a regular cinema film only in Korean without English subtitles but watching the film you can easily understand whats going on Very good  Outside youll find a variety of military airplanes including a B52 tanks and artillery Theres also a reproduction of the Cheonan which was attacked and sunk by North Korea in 2010 The film here shows the attack and theres a Heroes Gallery memorializing the six sailors who died  All in all this is a wonderful museum We found it a perfect complement to a DMZJSA tour to really make everything clear and more understandable  There are plans to expand the memorials grounds upon acquisition of land currently occupied by the US military they plan to move out in the coming years Will make the current park even more appealing  Easily reached by Subway lines 4 or 1 or via bus About a 45 minute walk south of the Millennium HiltonSeoul Station and not far from Itaewon,Positive,0.9858,Positive
1944,5.0,Outside this unmissable cathedrallike building are two very striking statue sequences almost Comminist or Socialist Realism in their heroic exhortative poses Then there are the various tanks armoured fighting vehicles aircraft and marine craft involved in the conflict on the peninsula since 1950 They are well laidout with good explanatory boards for each external exhibit The huge B52 dominates all of these and sets the context  Inside the exhibition is laid out chronologically over three floors each with two wings It is vast inside Each stage of the conflict is depicted using film sound static displays and sonetlumiere all to great educational and learning effect There are displays of social and 2d art and curiously in the main foyer an armoured junk which if used during the Korean War then someone was in real trouble  There is also on the entry to the main ramp a Hall of remembrance with large marble slabs depicting the names of The Fallen from Korea in Hangul  This superb museum is an exhibition par excellence and a visitor would find it rewarding and informative even if they were not interested in warfare An absolute must seemust do,Positive,0.9048,Positive

1960,4.0,The War Memorial is a really essential place to visit for those interested in the history of Korea and how it came to be divided into the two North and South Koreas which we know now One cannot technically blame the South Koreans for depicting North Koreans and Chinese soldiers as the evil communists namely due to the effect of media propaganda in the 1960s and 1970s which suffered from the communist scare and that also filters off into the exhibitions which also dealt with the North Korean army as well,Positive,-0.8971,Negative

1963,4.0,My boyfriend and I stopped at the War Memorial at one of the stops on the Seoul City Bus Tour Although it was highly informative and interesting but because of the limited time we were staying in Korea 1 week I would have skipped this part The museum is fairly big and filled with lots of educational material  which I think is great for kids There were many families there But if you dont have much time I would skip it,Positive,0.4735,Positive

1966,4.0,Neat weapons on display outside Provides an understanding of the event which most strongly shaped modern Korean history though somewhat full of nationalist propaganda A guided tour will give you a more complete perspective,Positive,0.1263,Positive
1967,5.0,Wow you could spend hours OUTSIDE the museum which is free before you even enter the monumental building The exhibits are balanced and wellcurrated with clear English explanations As someone whose grandfather came to Korea to fight I found the museum even more impressive You may find it hard to follow some of the exhibits and battles if youre not too familiar with the context but I think the museum does a good job in teaching and explaining things on a level most can understand May be better to go alone so you can take as much or as little time as you needwant,Positive,0.8764,Positive
1968,5.0,Set in a lovely park this is a feast for lovers of statues and aeroplanes Dont miss the beautiful mosaic inside the building with 2 embracing brothers on top of it  it closed at 430 We didnt go inside the museum but found the park respectful and impressive And free,Positive,0.952,Positive

1971,5.0,Spent entire day at this amazing place Has incredible static display of tanks aircraft and even a gunboat I went on the free English language tour and then stayed for lunch at the cafeteria and wandered around The displays are complete and are geared for schoolchildren but detailed enough for adults The appreciation for the United Nations forces is manifest in memorials and displays There are several short videos and all in English or subtitles I really learned a lot and left less cynical than before,Positive,0.8776,Positive
1972,5.0,It was more than just a museum The consequences of the war in the Korean Peninsula are still evident in the present days with the North and South divide Our experience was informative and educational It is a mustsee place when visiting Seoul,Positive,-0.5994,Negative
1973,5.0,Its no secret that a proxy albeit very costly war was fought across both halves of the Korean peninsula in the 1950s Its also needs no big stretch of the imagination that the truce could be irreversibly broken again at any time due to the diametrically opposed political beliefs of the North and South Korean governments With this as the background this rather grandiose building at least at first glance might appear to serve as a temple to the glories or war True there are many exhibits that come across as unreservedly nationalistic and play on the werethegoodies and theyrethebaddies mentality But delve beneath the surface of the exhibits and there are many instances where the suffering of the Korean people is a central theme of a deeper desire for reunification  Theres a lot to keep the visitor occupied and for military enthusiasts its best to keep at least a halfday free In fact the memorial portion of the building is actually quite small compared to the Korean War displays with plenty of mention of United Nations especially American contributions that take up a couple of floors in one wing Other interesting sections include one on the local armed forces more recent skirmishes between the two Koreas as well as one on warfare during the Joseon period circa late14th to late19th centuries Displays range from old sailing vessels to cannons to military hardware Indeed military hardware from the 20th century takes up an enormous external parklike space adjacent to the memorial building and could easily require over an hour to do it proper justice  The easiest subway station is Samgakji serviced by lines 4 and 6 from where its an easy 5minute walk to the entrance gates of the Memorial,Positive,0.9776,Positive

1980,3.0,This is a really elaborate museum and very well done Theres so much to see and you will be here for hours Americans visitors will probably appreciate it most after Koreans The reason I mention Americans is because they are also heavily memorialised here too and you cant help but admire the apparent bond between the two nations I would recommend a visit if you have an interest in the history of war in Korea,Negative,-0.1314,Negative
1981,3.0,In that area you notice very well the American presence in South Korea It is full of American soldiers and you do not feel so much the Korean environment It is the area of Seoul I liked the less,Negative,0.6361,Positive

1992,5.0,A wonderful day out This is one of the best exhibits we have seen for a long time Outside all the exhibits are in very good condition and it will take an hour or just to see them Inside the museum the layout is very impressive and there are many short videos on the history of the Korean war The place is spotless and there a few places inside where you can get something to eat Definitely worth a visit,Positive,0.937,Positive

2002,5.0,An awesome experience to see the fighter jets submarines and other equipment used in the Korean War However the tributememorials to all the soldiers who lost their lives is also a very sobering part of the experience Inside the exhibits are bursting at the seams with information about the War Youll leave with a greater appreciation for those who served and the trials and hardships the Korean people faced,Positive,-0.2247,Negative
2003,4.0,I visited here with my family not even a month ago because I was going to leave Korea for a while soon and Ive never been As we walked up the entrance there were walls full of names korean and foreign or people who died in the war there were so many americans and koreans and just walking down was a humbling experience Inside the museum there is a lot of walking and so many things that I never even thought of  Outside they have an entire field dedicated to planes tanks helicopters and other ways of war Just seeing everything the history the weaponry the people was great I recommend it,Positive,-0.5994,Negative

2005,5.0,This is a museum that continues to get better from already good It is huge and one should budget a good two hours to take it in properly This museum while largely consumed by the Korean War also reviews war duing Koreas long history  During the past ten years the Korean Government has spent a great deal of resources in upgrading the national museums to make them to be world class in quality This is no exception,Positive,0.6249,Positive
2006,5.0,This place definitely earns its first ranking in the Places to visit in Korea list rated by Trip Advisor You will be greeted with awesome sculptures with stories behind that at the entrance If you love history this is a mustgo destination for you You would know a lot about the Korean War which has separated the North and South Korea till today There are lots of 3D visuals and cinemas to make things easier to be comprehended You will also get to know interesting stories about sacrifices for brotherhood family for the nation Saying it awesome is really an understatement Please visit this place it made my friends cried and my nose twitched when we read all those beautiful sacrifices  Freedom is Not Free,Positive,0.9804,Positive
2007,5.0,On the next to the last day of our trip to Seoul I visited the War Memorial and also the National Museum of Korea These two are definitely worth a visit Really nice museums and we had an Englishspeaking tour guide He served in the Korean Army and was so interesting We only stayed to do the guided tour about an hour Could have spent longer there,Positive,0.7418,Positive

2023,5.0,Ive been here three times and learned something new with each visit I admit that the museum can be overwhelming due to its size but its certainly worth the visit  For starters you could easily spend an hour or two just outside looking at all the old planes tanks etc as well as the names etched in stone Once inside you could spend another few hours depending on your interest on the multiple levels  But what really sets this museum apart from others are the displays and the way some of the information is presented which includes a couple of 3D and 4D theater presentations,Positive,0.9393,Positive

2027,5.0,This is a review for both the memorial and the museum which should really be considered one  First off the memorial itself was beautiful and powerful The statues really give a sense of the struggles of the past and even the present day split between the people of Korea  Secondly the museum allows you to see all sorts of historical jets tanks weapons armor etc etc that youd be hard pressed to find elsewhere Truly a fantastic experience for any fan of military history Theres also a lot of history from before the Korean war in the memorial you can even see a replica of a Korean turtle ship  When I visited in May they even had a performance that happened right outside the museum They had various martial arts performances followed by a marching performance done by all four branches of the Korean Armed Forces Quite a sight to behold  Also its free I dont see why anyone would miss this unless history completely bores you,Positive,0.7102,Positive

2033,5.0,I do strongly recommend visiting this modern style museum There are several in and outdoor exhibitions of weapons uniforms military equipment not only used by Korean armed forces but theie allies as well Moreover there are interactive scenes which show the horror of the war This makes the biggest impression This place is free of charge and You can reach it by Seoul subway Then take a 2030 minutes walk or take a bus from the subway station The facilities are very good too There are number of restaurants offering different kinds of food from Korean to fast food You order at the central desk by choosing a number of the restaurant and a meal Very convinient To sum up good idea if You have more than a day in Seoul,Positive,0.8414,Positive
2034,5.0,Easily one of the best museums Ive ever visited only the Imperial War Museum in London is better Id say Everything has bilingual tags very varying exhibitions and well structured making it a pleasure to explore this fabulous museum,Positive,0.9371,Positive

2036,5.0,We are appreciative of the soldiers who fought many years ago which sort of shaped the world we are in Although I never got to experience the war era it was a nostalgic moment to go through the War Memorial of Korea to see the many countries that were part of the war The displays were well presented and there are a lot of interesting readings and items to see,Positive,-0.765,Negative
2037,5.0,The place was very creative in presenting the Korean War At the entrance there were walls filled with the soldiers names from different part of the world Then inside there was a 4D presentation presenting the war and how cold the weather was And not forgetting all the memorials and the equipments used over the years Strongly recommend you visit it,Positive,-0.2516,Negative
2038,5.0,If your into history this is for you The worlds largest war memorial offered free admission might be a summer promotion and english tour was about an hr which I highly recommend to do over just seeing it yourself Theres different floors which are dedicated to the diff wars that took place in korea or affected koreans,Positive,-0.0018,Neutral
2039,5.0,The recollection of bygone korean wars succession of defeats and successes and the sufferings of the Korean people throughout the war and after,Positive,-0.6597,Negative
2040,4.0,Fascinating museum suitable for all ages as the museum has currently the only war museum designed for children Most of what we saw was the childrens area which fascinated our 7 year old twins No doubt the focus was a South Korean perspective as one would expect Im sure the North Korean equivalent would tell a contrasting perspective,Positive,0.0772,Positive
2041,2.0,Im fascinated by the Korean War and I was really looking forward to seeing this museum but I was hugely disappointed in it; this is less of a museum than an exercise in propaganda in which the heroic South Koreans and savior Americans defeat the evil North Korean  Chinese Communists A more balanced and nuanced perspective on the history of this important war would do much to contribute to educating the public about it but this museum is really a waste of time I hate to say The only thing that piqued my interest was the huge model of Admiral Yi Sunshins famous turtle ship that he used to defeat the Japanese in the Seven Years War 15921598 The Korean government needs to commission a group of Korean War scholars to revise the text in English and Korean of all of the exhibits in the museum; Id suggest Prof Bruce Cumings of the University of Chicago one of the leading experts on the Korean War Until and unless this is done this museum will have limited credibility as a history museum,Negative,-0.9918,Negative
2042,5.0,If you are interested in history and war this is the place for you It is huge We spent a whole day there The only complaint is that the Korean war section is bordering to being too long,Positive,-0.7184,Negative
2043,5.0,The War Memorial of Korea is a place of epic proportions appropriate for a place that pays tribute to just about every single battle fought on Korean soil in recorded history The visitor route starts in the actual memorial room which is very plain and then moves downstairs to a huge display recounting all of the battles of the medieval and early modern eras Some of the information on specific battles was a bit dense and this section felt somewhat repetitive as one battle against the ChineseJapanese turns into another This section does make use of replica fortress walls and a turtle ship and also includes the first fantastic lifesize diorama and audiovisual presentation more of which are found in the Korean War display The Korean War display is the real highlight of the museum and is worthy of lots of your time The lifesized scenes showing soldiers crossing the 38th parallel soldiers defending bridges in Seoul and the signing of the armistice really brought the history to life After this I went outside and explored the park with its countless tanks missiles and planes on show The War Memorial of Korea is a truly impressive museum but I wish I had taken a moment when I got there to figure out exactly what bits I wanted to see before aimlessly starting my visit When I visited they were giving away FREE copies of a daybyday history of the Korean War in English and Korean which I thought was a great idea for a meaningful souvenir for visitors to take away The War Memorial is a mustsee for anyone visiting Seoul,Positive,0.5853,Positive
2044,4.0,A very informative place to scan through all the war in Korea Very interesting historical timeline that many people have a misconception about Korea history Recommended for students military enthusiast and educator,Positive,0.3384,Positive
2045,5.0,Fantastic museum maybe the largest I have seen Inside a huge building Koreas history was presented from 0 BC to today with main focus on the Korean War Then there was tanks and battleships and planes outside together with some very impressive War monuments You could easily spend a day there and learn a lot about Korea I learnt a lot,Positive,0.3804,Positive
2046,4.0,Spent one hour exploring the museum What really made the whole experience come alive was the English tour It covered the Korean War in as much possible as an hour allowed They have some fascinating exhibits but the tour really helped all these things to come alive The korean war even holds 2 guiness world records Something I didnt know but was impressed by Go find out what Try your best to get on a tour though as you will simply learn so much more I would not have enjoyed the museum as much if it werent for the tour,Positive,0.7225,Positive

2052,5.0,I thought that I knew the history of the Korean War but this museum gave me so much more and in a very interesting way It made the history come live and made me curious for even more info There is an interesting and very impressive collection of original airplanes and vehicles from the war and in addition you can see more modern vehicles used by the Korean army The long rows of stone columns with endless rows of names on South Korean soldiers who died during the Korea War made me quiet and thoughtful I cant really comprehend the extent of the casualties such a war takes The history is taking you right up to the newest incidences in the Korean conflict including the naval incidents 1999 2002 and 2010 This clearly shows why South Korean people and government still take the situation very seriously The Korean War Museum is a mustsee if youll try to understand not just that particular war but also the whole situation in the East Asian area,Positive,-0.9503,Negative
2053,5.0,The title of this attraction does not do it justice as it is so much more than just a memorial but an entire complex and museum where you could easily spend half a day  The property itself is gorgeous containing many sculptures of the war and an entire field of tanks planes and other weapons which are cool to look at and explore  The museum itself is very well done and surprisingly completely free The bottom floor contains Korean history and an overview of all the dynastys while the other floors focus on the Korean war  I honestly didnt know much about the war before coming here nor am I a big museum person but I found this museum to be extremely informative and engaging and I learned quite a lot  This is a great way to spend an afternoon learn some history and see some tanks ,Positive,0.9426,Positive

2059,5.0,I really enjoyed the War Memorial of Korea Not only is it a very informative museum teaching you in great detail the history of Korea and the Korean War but the museum is presented in a very enjoyable way Its laid out in a way that makes it nice to walk through even for someone who is not a history buff  Additionally the outdoor area is interesting with old fighter planes and battle tanks There are also multiple 4D theaters that show short films  though sadly these were closed from MERS  The museum at times can be a little intense due to the nature of the subject but its definitely a worthwhile enjoyable and educational place to visit while in Seoul,Positive,0.9515,Positive

2070,3.0,Decided to go here as we had booked a trip to the border of Koreas for the next day and wanted to be as informed as possible The museum is very large an you need to take some time to go through it The history starts from way back and we were mainly interested in the modern history so we sort of rushed through the stone age etc parts and spent more time getting to know the recent history We found it to be a bit too onesided which of course can be understood but would have been interesting to know a bit more about the reasons etc of the wars but it turned out to be a how much do we love the UN for standing with us kind of experience The next day we took the trip to the border and turned out that theres a ton of information and slideshows included in the tours with much deeper level of recent history than the museum had so in case you are going here just to be informed about the recent 100 years maybe history and you are going to the border trip as well dont bother Otherwise if you are interested in history this is your kind of place Entrance is free which is a plus Be aware that its closed on Mondays throughout the year,Negative,0.9612,Positive
2071,3.0,For a war memorial there wasnt much emotion about war itself and how war is bad The displays are in reasonable shape but not excellent Good that its free though Probably would 2 hours to see the whole thing,Negative,-0.8822,Negative
2072,5.0,If you like history of Korea especially its war history then this is the right place for you to visit The first floor was from prehistoric era so youll probably best to skip it but it is still not bad to see though Second and third level were for Korean War Vietnam war donated artefacts arsenals tanks howitzer and jets models Can spend more than 1 hour just to look at all the exhibitions there; more if you want to read all the explanations in details Do not forget to visit the park on the left since it contains more of real size vehicle models tanks jets tank destroyer etc A really good place to spend your time in Seoul There is no entrance fee close at 6PM can hire local tour guide there from inside the building,Positive,-0.7973,Negative

2079,5.0,No question this was the most interesting thing I visited while in South Korea It is very easily accessible from the Samgakji train stop no more than a 10 minute walk Just make sure you get out of the correct exit I would save about 3 hours to go through it quickly and hopefully its not a rainy day as there are some very impressive memorials old tanks vehicles places boats and missals on display outside Along with a few large passage ways which honor every solider that was killed in duty from every country and even state Inside its just massive and gives you a great run down of what happened why it happened and where things stand today which i knew very little of the history Obviously there are artifacts galore on the war but its much more than that too I highly recommend this Oh yeah and its Free,Positive,0.9472,Positive
2080,5.0,I totally LOVED this museum I am a bit of a war history geek so this place was like heaven As you enter there is a very moving statue that is a tribute to the Korean War and while much of this museum is dedicated to Korean War history there are also displays about other military campaigns and military artifacts from the entirety of Korean history On the grounds of the museum there are a lot of aircraft and tanks and troop transport vehicles that have played a significant role in Korean Military history  most impressive is an American B52 Inside there are more displays that highlight the history of the Korean War as well as a limousine that belonged to Kim Il Sung that was captured by the ROK Army during the Korean War The highlight of the museum  the reason for my visit  was the large scale model of a Turtle Ship which is the ship that was used by Admiral Yi Soon Shin to defeat the Japanese Navy in 1592,Positive,0.6055,Positive

2095,5.0,Im not the biggest fan of museums more so of remembering any war Having said this I would have to say that a visit to Korea would be incomplete without at least taking a look at the collection technology throughout the decades The displays are either replicas or the real artifact that saw battle in the wars that South Korea has been involved with There are also many vehicles and weapons that have been collected throughout the museums history to give a better view of what may have happened at that particular time in history This museum much like the entire city is hightech There are viewings and displays that employ the latest tech in presenting the visitors the look and feel of what happened during a particular battle There are 510 minute video presentations Some of these are done in artistic ways to evoke feelings of commiseration from the viewers for the full sympathetic and empathetic impact Outside the memorial however the visitors can go in and out the the different type of tanks and go up the big planes that have seen wartime This is a great treat for the young and the young at heart For pen and paper game board enthusiasts that paint soldier and vehicle figures having a more tactile experience with the life size replica or real tank can bring wonder to the mind that it can take a visitor a couple of hours going in and out the tanks and ships in the courtyard of the memorial This was our second visit to this place and there have been changes to the displays and viewings At least we know that the museum is dynamic and is still relevant to visiting tourists and locals alike,Positive,0.6846,Positive
2096,5.0,The great green garden is there to remind you that we all come to ashes The whole area is full of memories of the nuclear attack Keep your eyes open for the large group of students they take there daily from all over the country they are so cute We all have to remember the war and never repeat it,Positive,0.2421,Positive

2125,4.0,So said our young Englishspeaking guide at the Korean War Memorial Of course this is the case with all such memorials and museums of conflict Nonetheless it is an interesting way to spend a few hours and I recommend that you arrive on time for a guided tour  One small thing  as one approaches the memorial building from the front one can see vending machines on the flanks of the building Thats just naff  I cant imagine walking up Anzac Avenue in Canberra and being greeted by the sight of vending machines at the Australian War Memorial It looks cheap; disrespectful even,Positive,-0.5859,Negative

2134,4.0,This museum housed in a beautiful classical style building covers all Korean Wars A large section is devoted to the 195053 conflict but it stretches back in history to the Japanese invasion of 1592 and earlier invasions from the Mongols It is located near the American Army Camp Kim For history buffs it is definitely worth a visit,Positive,0.7391,Positive
2135,5.0,This museum was much bigger than I expected There is a lot of information and detailed exhibits of the Korean War It would be good to go here before going to the DMZ but not necessary I suggest going earlier in the day than I did I only planned for an hour or two and it took much longer After I finished with the inside I made my way around to the side of the museum where you can climb on old tanks and planes This part was particularly fun since most museums dont allow visitors on or in the weaponry I highly recommend going here,Positive,0.6525,Positive
2136,5.0,Hungry and still a little shocked from the great fish market massacre we decided to hit our next stop which was the War Memorial of Korea Be prepared to spend 24 hours at the museum and walk up a lot of steps just to get to the entry It was ginormous and definitely an attraction you do not want to miss The best part of all its free There were countless displays interactive exhibits and they even offered a selfguided audio tour in your language on request Im by no means a history buff but there was a video exhibit detailing the war history alliance between South Korea and America that made us tear up but again you cant take us too seriously because we watch Korean dramas \xe2\x80\x94 so we cry at everything,Positive,-0.8131,Negative

2415,5.0,The Korea War Memorial is an enormous place with a large War Museum built around it  Pros 1 If you are at all interested in the Korean War or how it led to modern South Korea this is the ONE place you should visit There is a fascinating audiovisual exhibition on the Korean War just inside the main building on the left And simply put It will explain EVERYTHING you could possibly want to know about the Korean War Youll understand How it came to happen What happened And from first principles youll understand very clearly how this has led to the modern South Korea of today Furthermore by understanding the background youll understand very clearly the current context behind the NorthSouth Korean situation And possibly its future ramifications  2 There is a wonderful outdoor exhibition as well demonstrating US and ExUSSR and Chinese military hardware from the mid 1940s onwards If you can think of a tank missile helicopter aircraft antiaircraft gun its probably here This is probably the SINGLE and most COMPREHENSIVE collection of postworld war 2 hardware in Asia In my humble opinion the only place youre going to find better is probably the Smithsonian Washington DC USA or the Imperial War Museum London and Duxford Cambridgeshire England  3 If you are interested in middleages Korea the basement is quite interesting There is a lovely replica of a Turtle Ship Geobukseon in the basement Worth visiting  Cons 1 You need to walk a little bit to get to the museum It took me about 510 minutes to find it The nearest subway station is Samgakji or Namyeong Stations 2 The military hardware is outdoors It started raining when I visited Thus I suggest you bring an umbrella or appropriate waterproofoutdoor clothes if you intend to spend much time looking at the outdoors military collection  In summary The War Memorial of Korea is probably the BEST War Museum in the whole of Asia You will not find a larger or better collection of military hardware in Asia To find better youll have to go to Washington DC in the USA or Duxford Cambridgeshire England  I spent 3 hours at the Korean War Memorial And only saw 2530 of the exhibits on offer This place is VAST You could easily spend the whole day here  To conclude if you are a family And you have a boy in your group below the age of 21 Just GO TO THE WAR MEMORIAL of Korea Your son will have more fun that the REST of your trip to Korea put together,Positive,0.3178,Positive

2464,5.0,An easy 10 minute walk from the metro be sure to allow plenty of time to visit as this is a lot more than a mere memorial We spent 35 hours here and could have spent another hour or so at least had it not been closing  Free entry  Start by walking in through the halls which include the names of those who died while serving in the military during the Koreans who died are also inscribed  We then went straight to the Korean War Room 1 and worked our way through all three war rooms Its a fully engrossing walk through the history of the war and the outcomes There is a degree of propaganda which is interesting to hear the opposite from the communist propaganda but needs bearing in mind  There are several 4D experience rooms  all of which are free but which operate at certain times only and can only accommodate a certain number of people The first was the Incheon Landings which only takes 15 at a time and runs for 7 minutes but operates only every 30 minutes I found it hard to stifle a laugh when the session started with a badly animated MacArthur who I hope bears no resemblance to the real MacArthur The animation is like a bad disney ride with a few jolts around while youre wearing 3D glasses The escape from the reservoir is better and takes 45 people at a time  Virtually all of the displays include full English translation and its easy to become completely engrossed in the full story of the War Theres an excellent section on the third floor on the United Nations involvement country by country not just the USA so be sure not to miss that On the ground floor theres an area to the right after the cafe where there are a couple of historic limos planes armored cars and jeeps some of which you can climb into worth heading in there for a few minutes but the display of tanks missiles planes and the boat outside is just superb and will satisfy the most dedicated military historians Its worth coming here just for this display alone  for the B52 Stratofortress to the MIG it was like being a kid in a candy shop  Its a superb museum and memorial to the war if youre going to take a trip to the DMZ and the JSA then I heartily recommend coming here BEFORE you take the trip it will clarify a great deal when you take the tour Be sure to allow plenty of time as you wont want to rush through My only criticisms would be that the signage isnt always clear as to which route you should take and you might find yourself backtracking a little and that I didnt feel that there was enough coverage on what happened to the people  there was very little detail on civilians and refugees but other than that this is a superb museum and memorial one of the best,Positive,0.9964,Positive

2498,5.0,On June 18 2014 I visited the War Memorial of Korea as part of ten week trip through Europe and Asia This site has one of the best tributes to those who participated in the socalled Korean War I was keen to see this as one of my Uncles participated but was fortunate to return home A large memorial hall lists the names of those died and offers a tribute to those who survived  I walked through the museum and looked at the indoor displays as well as numerous war machines on the grounds surrounding the building I learned that many nations supported the war effort to drive the North Koreans supported by the Chinese from South Korea,Positive,-0.3182,Negative
2499,5.0,I went to this museum after looking on TripAdvisor as I had a few spare hours in Seoul Its a bit difficult to get to if your using the subways it has a bit of a walk but its worth it When you approach it you can almost feel all of the history immediately the front of the museum is absolutely huge and there are some really meaningful statues at the front particularly the one of the 2 soldiers from each side of Korea hugging you can see the desire for peace The walls entering the museum are inscribed with all the names of the fallen soldiers throughout the 50 odd years of war between the 2 sides There are some truly good and informative exhibits and displays throughout the museum and the path it takes you on is done in chronological order so it allows you to encompass the whole timeline of war I felt I had a much better understanding of the conflict after looking around Theres also really good interactive exhibits with projections and simulations Its really well done and worth a look around if your in Seoul There is also a lot of commemorative displays relating to South Koreas involvement in the UN and other projects where they have provided assistance its really interesting Make sure you go and see this,Positive,0.9812,Positive
2500,5.0,This may be one of the best museums that I have ever been to anywhere The museum presented the history of Korea over the past 200 years adequately and thoughtfully and there was a large supply of exhibits and weaponry to make it interesting All of the exhibits were also in English This is a must see in my opinion,Positive,0.8271,Positive

2502,5.0,Went to this War Memorial after seeing listed on trip advisor and was very impressed Spent over 3 hours and could have easily spent longer They have a large area full of planes tanks boats and other military equipment that you can see up close and even climb inside some of them  The indoor exhibits of the Korean War and other historical Korean wars are well done They have english speaking tour guides volunteers so no tip needed and english explanations on most of the plaques There are also several honoring and thoughtful memorials to fallen soldiers  There are several 3D or 4D films  but be aware these run basically on the hour or half hour from 9 to 5 and have limited seating so it may be difficult to catch all of them depending how long you stay,Positive,-0.8321,Negative
2503,4.0,Went to the memorial unsure of how it would be Very good exhibits showing history of wars in Korea with nice mix of historical archivesanalysis and big war toys like tanks and planesWas surprisingly interesting and good for a couple hours We didnt take one but English tours are available One downside very limited air conditioning adn the place gets hot in summer,Positive,-0.3064,Negative
2504,4.0,It is a very detailed museum and with alot of things to see and do With plenty of photo opportunities on the outside and detailed galleries inside it is worth going to You will learn not only about the Korean war but some early Korean history and a fair bit on the UN as well,Positive,0.6597,Positive

2506,5.0,The war memorial is so great I learned so much about korea and the war Its big beautiful very well made and its free Make sure to take a tour The tour is for free they offer it at the enterance The tour guides are not just tour guides they are very knowledgeable and passionate Our english tour guide was a army veteran had served for 20years He asked us where we were from and what did we want from the tour He personlized the tour for us gave us big picture and related canadian and indian role to the war  since we are indo canadians,Positive,0.9135,Positive

2508,4.0,After a long day on a DMZ tour we decided it best to take in the museum for even a short time otherwise we may have missed the opportunity altogether I was pleased we did A museum more than a memorial it has something for everyone The inside of the museum while having quite a few cultural exhibits mainly covers the Korean War The interactive and multimedia exhibits are excellent and are available in English Unfortunately we were a little late arriving to seetry many of them My wife and I wandered around aimlessly for a couple of hours so I suggest you arrive early enough to make use of the volunteers  The outside of the museum is a boneyard of old tanks planes guns boats and all manner of other war machinery Being able to climb in and around this equipment is a delight for adults and children alike In contrast the statues and memorials you pass outside the museum is a poignant reminder that this is a memorial to those who served and died during this conflict  If you have time I suggest you allow four hours to appreciate this impressive site,Positive,0.826,Positive

2510,3.0,I was impressed with the well thought architecture the meticulous effort in detail and variety of displays of the Korean war and the informative history of the Korean warfare I could feel a sincere homage paid to UN forces that helped defend South Korea  However it could have been better if it also showed more about North Korean and Chinese young souls who were dragged into the war at the time of emerging Cold War era and it should have been millions of civilian victims and divided families that must be in the center of focus in the tragedy instead of glorifying war heroes  It is more of a museum for war heroes and less of a memorial for war victims,Negative,-0.9432,Negative

2524,4.0,I liked all of the historical items from the chosen dynasty but did not appreciate how little America was mentioned during the Korean conflict I found the War Memorial replaced American troops with United Nation troops Sure the UN was there but American made up 90 of the UN forces and we lost many lives freeing the Korean people Even on maps showing coordinating attacks the US troops where marked under at UN flag Disappointing,Positive,-0.8907,Negative

2527,3.0,We came expecting a poignant memorial to the Korean war It is not this at all and if I was reviewing it was a memorial I do not think it is very good at all This is a museum dedicated to the Korean War  Outside the memorial there are plenty of military planes tanks and missiles This sums up the internal exhibits It is a subjective look at the war You do learn a lot about a war that was effectively a world war one that killed millions in just 6 months and then another million in the two years of negotiations  Other exhibits include a military look at Korean History with dioramas There are free guided tours where the volunteer can explain the Korean War in detail We were lucky and had a History student who was able to discuss the political discourse with us  The one area that was dedicated to peace seemed very tacky to me and I felt it didnt commemorate the memory of those who died It was a room with faux tombstones that had battles projected on to them  If you come expecting a museum of war then this is a good place to spend a few hours learning a bit about the Korean war If you come expecting a museum of peace and commemoration then like me you will be disappointed I do think it was a bit too brazen and glorified the fighting a too much but then most museums about war seem to  It is free and is close to the subway You just need to walk around the American base to get here,Negative,-0.861,Negative

2534,5.0,Very informative with lots of awesome artifacts I tried my luck and asked if there was any guided tour in English The counter staff assigned a 14 year old schoolboy volunteer to bring me around Really thankful for that It took about 30 minutes and i found out that he was actually on school vacation but he signed up as a Englishspeaking museum guide on his own Good lad After the tour i went back in for a 2nd look as i wanted to take photos  Tip  1 If you have limited time your itinerary should be 2nd floor Korea War then 3rd floor UN then on to the 1st floor Medieval warfare  2 If you arrive late in the day the outdoor display of war machines should be viewed last as they are outside the museum So in the event of the museum closure you can still venture outside among the machines The highlight for me was the replica I think of a Scud missile,Positive,-0.5932,Negative
2535,5.0,As a non military buff this was a really good trip It is free to get in and had an awesome display of all things war as they relate to Korea  The outside has planes tanks helicopters boats and all sorts of military transports that you can climb all over  A great experience,Positive,0.8955,Positive
2536,5.0,This is an excellent museum We went on a Saturday morning and it was not busy at all The first floor is the history prior to 1950 which was a little dry but the rest was about the Korean War UN involvement in other wars and the future weapons of war  which was all great Be sure the check out the giant ship outside too  Very easy to get to from the metro as well and totally free We spent almost 3 hours there,Positive,0.3246,Positive

2539,5.0,This is a great museum There are tanks and planes outside to see and monuments and sculptures Inside is very big If you have kids with you there is a special place in the museum just for them It was very interesting reading and seeing displays about the Korean War and how it was started and how the US helped You will enjoy it if you like history It could be a little too long a visit for those who do not,Positive,0.8908,Positive
2540,5.0,I definitely recommend visiting the War Memorial and Museum The site in itself is quite impressive with some beautiful statues and other memorials The exhibition is very well done its very interactive with various videos for example and presents the visitors with clear precise and detailed descriptions of the wars that Korea has been through Although I was mostly interested in the war between North and South Korea in the 1950s the museum covers a historical period that ranges from approximately 11001200 to the early 2000s This is equally a great place to visit with children and entry is free,Positive,0.937,Positive
2541,5.0,I was just expecting to see a statue in a park but it was so much more There are two statues at the front one depicting two brothers from different sides who meet on the battlefield Further on there is a display of tanks planes rockets even a ship Then there is the museum which doesnt just show recent conflicts but goes back many centuries There are many very good displays showing ships a castle battle scenes uniforms from different eras and so much more This should not be missed,Positive,-0.5542,Negative

2544,3.0,I went there with my two year old wondering if there would be things to do Even though the childrens museum was closed but there was lots to do The outdoor park with retired planes parked is great fun A little pond with fishes was rest fun too There is a childrens play area which required a ticket It seemed like fun but last entry was at 5 pm Nice exhibits and lots to learn,Negative,0.9849,Positive
2545,5.0,This is an impressive memorial Not only is the building itself impressive but the outside collection of war vehicles and planes is worth a visit alone,Positive,-0.4939,Negative
2546,5.0,In my opinion this is the definitive museum to visit if you want to learn about the history of not just the Korean War but also its historical roots from the founding of the Korean Peninsula A great memorial for those who died in the war The displays are incredibly informative and there are also attractions within the museum like simulators or short filmsYou need to queue for these For the kids there are also many different fun activities littered throughout the complex I advise visitors to follow the recommended route as it allows you to follow the proper timeline and sequence of events  Outside the main building there is a large area dedicated to static displays of soviet and allied vehicles used in the Korean war ranging from tanks planes and even a warship A great way to let civilians get up close and personal with military equipment  From my experience you definitely need a whole day if you intend to visit The War Memorial of Korea just because it is such a huge complex Also if you are lucky you may also spot a miniparade by the US ArmyI think held at the Parade Ground in front of the Main Building The museum closes pretty early during the low season so Id recommended finishing up inside before heading to the static displays which are open all day,Positive,0.9562,Positive

2552,5.0,This place is massive Its also part museum along with being a memorial And its free I was recently at the USS Arizona Memorial and while that was very personal being from America I thought the Korean War Memorial was much more thorough  Outside there are number of statues and memorial that are very well done They also have one of the largest collections of war equipment tanks planes artillery etc that Ive ever seen Also on the outside are walls filled with names of people that died during the war What I found unique is that not only do they have the names of Koreans but also people from other countries that served during the war  Inside they have a multilevel building with extensive information on the war and some early Korean history There were a number of short films some said 3D and 4D but unfortunately I didnt have enough time to view any of them Most of the signage was also in English which was very nice They provide guided tours in a few different languages including English  I could have spent 4 hours here but unfortunately only had about 25 hours If youre the kind of person that stops at almost every display and watches every film make sure you allow for several hours or you will end up missing a lot,Positive,-0.9543,Negative
2553,5.0,The museum is huge and the whole area is beautifully set There is a lot of interactive stuff like 4D cinemas authentic radio messages the combat experience room and photo spots Everything is also described in English Come early and plan a lot of time The museum closes already at 6pm and is closed on Mondays I recommend further reading on the Korean war as it might leave you onesided and biased,Positive,0.34,Positive

2555,5.0,The War Memorial of Korea and museum provide a wonderful day of sightseeing in Seoul The museum is large and has wonderful exhibits about Korea history and the wars that formed their country First of all the museum is free to the public Secondly the South Koreans honored the American soldiers with an entire floor of the museum and the names of the 33000 soldiers who lost their lives in the war efforts Additionally the memorials and the outside area showing the planes tanks and boats were popular with not only the kids but for the adults as well It was certainly a high point in our trip to Korea,Positive,0.7935,Positive
2556,5.0,I spent several hours here enjoying the exhibits and the chance to learn about the history of Korea As an Australian the handling of Australias efforts in the Korean War brought me to tears it was so well done The is plenty here for all ages from very young to the aged And its very well organised and laid out  I highly recommend visiting this,Positive,0.783,Positive
2557,4.0,The whole monument and the museum serves to remind us about the great service done by soldiers not only of Korea but also of various other countries All the names are etched in the memorial and glorifies them for eternity The museum has a lot of documents medals uniforms weapons used scale models of vehicles ships and airplanes and also many full size models It is beautifully maintained and entry is free of charge,Positive,0.926,Positive
2558,5.0,First of all its free of charge The first time we came here we had very short of time however we found it very intresting and decided to go back the next day The museum is focused on the korean war but also features exhibitions about Koreas earlier wars with Japan The korean warexhibition was really fascinating and thrilling and divided into three parts room 12 and 3 I learned alot I didnt know before,Positive,0.7457,Positive
2559,3.0,I find it curious that the War Memorial of Korea is the top attraction for Seoul It is free and it does have interesting bits but top attraction for the average visitor  Anyway the War Memorial is house in a very large building within a large park One side of the park is full of vintage tanks and aircraft There is a patrol boat in a pond which is quite impressive in the sense that its hard to figure out how they got the boat in a pond in the middle of Seoul  The main building has several levels The main level is dominated by a big room dedicated to those who died in battle The lower level has a brief military history of Korea from Paleolithic to end of the Korean Empire told through battles which must be obscure to all but the specialists  The greatest amount of space in the rest of the building is taken up by the details of the Korean War which must represent more than half the museum The section on all those countries those that contributed to the UN forces was done very well The role of the modern Korean military and the Korean defense industry wraps up the exhibition  Overall it is worth a visit and you do see some interesting stuff but on the whole the curation was not very clear and I had trouble trying to see a coherent theme I think it must be difficult to curate a war museum designed for both locals and visitors especially if the visitors are from nations who were how shall we say involved in those wars but now are major trading partners,Negative,-0.929,Negative

2562,5.0,I dont really know much about Korean war and I am no expert in world history However visiting this place made me think about many things and especially Koreans tribute to those who sacrificed themselves was very moving Unlike many other museums you will visit in other leading countries in this place you will be told a war story from the other side of the view that is Koreans the weaker countrys view that struggled to protect their people and peace against powerful nations like Russia China and Japan It really lets you to understand the costs of war in a more complete manner There are many different things for all ages to enjoy I can see the effort put into this memorial Highly recommended,Positive,-0.5434,Negative
2563,5.0,Ive read about the Korean War and was called up for National Service but wasnt sent there This first class museum brought a lot of it home to me A terrible period in Korean history but well worth visiting to see what they went through and to then marvel at how South Korea is now,Positive,0.2732,Positive
2564,5.0,If you are interested in the history of the Korean War this is the place to go Huge comprehensive welldesigned Lots of artifacts documents photos war machinery There are some gimmicky things like a 4D motion simulator ride that is more for fun than for historical education but overall the museum is great,Positive,0.8312,Positive

2567,5.0,This museum was a pleasant experience lasts approximately 3 hours A museum very large and full of things to see Inside there are some representations of ancient wars dating back to the last millennium spread over 2 levels Outside on the other hand there is a fantastic collection of weapons ammunitions from most recent wars including helicopters planes and tanks The main attraction of this incredible memorial park is a warship a 30 meters boat perfectly preserved dating back to the war of Korea it is possible to visit the inside and are tangible signs of bullets Experience unforgettable and absolutely free of charge,Positive,0.7346,Positive

2569,4.0,Very interesting and informative place to visit albeit somewhat sobering Lots of information and wellillustrated exhibits about the history of Korea and the Korean war It is a bit out of the way and whilst it is relatively easy to get to by subway a taxi is actually a far cheaper option,Positive,0.1245,Positive

2572,4.0,We went through the wrong entrance so it was a bit hard to find for us but once inside it was great It was free and huge It includes not only information on the Korean War but also all the conflicts theyve had before It had a 3D and 4D warfare experience theatre as well as a shooting range Allow about 15 to 2 hrs for this museum,Positive,0.6428,Positive
2573,4.0,While living in Korea for three years my return visit with my mom was my first time here Autumn brought in a melancholic pretty and quiet atmosphere in the place Part of the exhibit in the lobby was the commemorative display naming all the Cheonan ship soldiers who died in the sinking and I thought it was sad beautiful  considerate Im not sure of the right word  and fitting to include them in the museum We were hoping to find my grandfathers  my immediate and his cousins  name as part of the first contingent who went to Korea during the war It was only later on that we realized only the Koreans names were included poor research our bad Nonetheless it was a good eye opener about Koreas history the invasions the wars  it explained a lot of what and how Korea came to be; in culture thinking perspectives  As we were leaving the museum we had this wonderful surprise of the soldiers doing a presentation of sorts  I forgot the festival My mother as a humanities professor enjoyed the show very much despite not understanding the narration It was a pleasant surprise and we enjoyed every bit of our visit in and outside the premises,Positive,0.9248,Positive

2575,4.0,We spend a full morning here The museum is free though you can spend an hour outside looking at the massive array of statues and military vehicles on display  There are a couple of food courts one inside the main building and one around the corner near the wedding hall  The only thing that marred this visit were the hundreds of high school students wreaking havoc all over the grounds It looked as if the teachers just turned them loose and went to go hide somewhere for the day They were smoking in the bathrooms running around putting on makeup in the POW exhibit  all kinds of crazy disrespectful stuff  Maybe time your visit after peak field trip hours or on the weekend and you will experience a very thoughtful somber museum  as it was intended,Positive,-0.734,Negative
2576,5.0,Husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this museum The indoor museum had more than just exhibits on the Korean War There were war exhibits from Koreas medieval period as well The corridors with lists of names of soldiers who died in the Korean War were well laid out and had a sense of serenity to it The outdoor museum was where the display of military vehicles was located You are allowed to see the displays up close and even explore the insides of some of the vehicles Even though I am not Korean and not a warmilitary enthusiast I found this place thoroughly enjoyable and is an honorable tribute to the fallen soldiers  My only regret was not getting to the museum earlier We arrived about 2 hours before closing time and had taken our time in the memorial corridor looking at the names of soldiers Hence we were unable to cover all floors of the indoor museum before closing time In hindsight we should have gone straight to the indoor museum and covered that first since we were able to take our time looking at the outdoor exhibits after museum closing time,Positive,-0.8087,Negative

2578,4.0,A relative in Seoul took us to this memorial It was interesting to both of us and there was a lot to see inside and outside  Try to go on a day that is not raining and not hot because there are a lot of military items to see outside and on the inside it was not particularly well air conditioned so we felt a bit hot inside  There really was a complete history or all sorts of wars from the recent Korean War as far back as thousands of years Its a good place to take a school kid to learn about history and there seemed to be a lot of school tours there at the time  There was not fee to enter the memorial and only a small parking fee that was conveniently located under the memorial,Positive,-0.6034,Negative

2586,5.0,I love history I have always loved history When I was a student in elementary and high school I always dedicated extra time to my history books; I wanted to understand why things are the way they are While studying abroad in college I found it fascinating that other countries tell the same story but with a different perspective After that revelation I have always enjoyed my history books in foreign countries and in foreign languages and learning new things about any given event It is fascinating to read about the SpanishAmerican war IN SPAIN And it seems an alternate universe to read about the USA in any given European Asian or Latin American country Thus I was prepared for revelations and new information the moment we entered the facility First the museum is free to all visitors; second it is a selfguided tour; you take a brochure and map and view things at your own pace The light and sound shows are well done and not overly exaggerated which would have reduced their message There are a couple that require a minimum of 5 people to begin We missed a couple because we were just 4 people  A word of caution however this museum is about all Korean wars not just the last one You will spend some time in 5th century feuding kingdoms see the play off between the Tang dynasty and Japan and the Mongol hordes over the next thousand years What once were 3 kingdoms with double the land area eventually contracted to one kingdom near the end of the 19th century before the Japanese invasion And then finally the full thrust and import to foreigners the events leading up to and including the Korean war 1950 to 1953  We all learned as high school students that the rapid removal of American troops and Secretary Achesons definition of Korea as outside the American defense perimeter after World War II contributed to the boldness on the part of the north to launch the war We didnt learn that North Korean leadership asked for permission from both the Soviet Union and China before launching their attack on the south and other interesting facts that did not come to light until after the collapse of the Soviet Union opened all those secret archives But the most interesting points to me were the minor one off events that became determining points in the war What if the ROK forces had not blown up the bridges over the Han River halting the Norths Russian tank advance for 6 days time enough for Truman to get troops to territory still held by ROK forces What if MacArthur had not gambled on a surprise landing at Incheon leading to the collapse of North Korean supply lines and the rapid retreat of the invasion force all the way back to the Chinese border What if the Chinese hadnt been so worried about an American ally on its border and hadnt entered the war What if Truman had authorized use of the ABomb So many what ifs to consider a dedicated student of history will find many such small but highly decisive events to ponder  I highly recommend this museum They say history is written by the victors and in the same way a people tell of their successes they often gloss over their failures and their shames I respect the Korean people immensely for coming to grips just over 10 years ago with the infamous 1950 summer of terror for not whitewashing what happened during that early tragic phase of the war Unfortunately I did not find that reference at this museum,Positive,-0.9838,Negative
2587,5.0,Other Korean history museums seemed to gloss over the split with N Korea This was the one place that clearly explained it to us My wife didnt want to go She thought it would be a boring downer But it turned out to be a fascinating and wellillustrated explanation The memorial statue outside of two embracing brothers is quite moving The place is huge but you can certainly skip the overly detailed stuff As long as youre interested in global politics and history its easily good for a 90minute to 2hour visit,Positive,0.9698,Positive
2588,4.0,My mother came to visit me and is loves history This is a place she really wanted to visit I am so glad we did The place is huge Statues and old war machines are surrounding the building Inside you get to see old war vessels information about past wars in Korea with interesting artifacts from those time periods Then as you go through you get to the korean war that separated North and South It was emotional You see countries that aided Korea and their heroes They recently added on a new section that used all the dog tags from the fallen soldiers and they made it in to a tear drop Its a dark room where drops of water form on the floor using projector and then the floor comes alive with tags falling with names on them It was beautiful There is so much to see and do in this museum that we ran out of time I am going back soon I want to finish exploring this beautiful museum,Positive,0.7695,Positive

2598,5.0,This is a very informative place and I certainly learnt a lot about the psyche of the Korean people who in my opinion are among some of the nicest and friendliest people in the world The statue of Brothers was so moving and relevant and says implicitly everything there is to be said about divided nations without words I absolutely loved this piece and stood mesmerised by it for a long time Well done Seoul for bringing your history alive,Positive,0.8603,Positive

2602,4.0,We had a couple of rainy days during our trip to Seoul so we decided to visit the war memorial during one of them  Whilst this meant we didnt get much time to look around the aircraft and other items outside the internal exhibits were brilliant and incredibly emotive as someone who only had a high level knowledge of the Korean War I found the memorial very interesting and gave me an insight in to the history and culture  A few of the interactive exhibits werent working hence 4 stars instead of 5 but it really is worth a visit,Positive,0.2764,Positive
2603,5.0,Before I arrived in Seoul I planned to visit the War Memorial but never thougt I will spent more than 3 hours visiting Its a very huge area consisting of outdoor and indoor sections Outside there are many tanks and armoured vehicles of army a small ship and some boats of navy and my favourate airplanes such as a huge B52 F5 T33 F84 F86 etc Indoors are seperated in different sections which is designed very good There is no entry fee There is a guided English tour at10001400 hours Indoor galleries consist of the ones which show the wars Korea went through  with very good show and animations and separate sections for UN countrys which supported them There is also a section which consists of donations of many war related items Also an area for children is available I plan to visit again next time I travel to Seoul ,Positive,0.423,Positive

2605,5.0,I was skeptical about visiting the War Memorial of Korea because my previous trips to similar sites in other countries had proved a real downer Usually war memorials tend to be drab and lonely places that people just pass by without so much as a glance I am happy to say the War Memorial of Korea is nothing like that When I went in late morning it was full of Korean teenagers dressed up for photos and plenty of tourists just enjoying the day The memorial consists of two parts The military equipment on display outdoors and the memorial itself with inscriptions honoring the soldiers For me the more interesting part is the outdoors one There you get to see a vast array of tanks artillery aircraft missiles and even a real patrol boat It is every boys grown mens dream come true There were descriptive and sometimes amusing information in English for the hardware which spanned periods from World War II to more recent times Where else can you see a North Korean spy submarine up close The main memorial building was not that interesting to me as the inscriptions were in Korean It had a solemn and reverent air about it to instill that sense of gravitas I made a quick walk through The memorial is highly recommended not only to see the military weaponry but also to catch a glimpse of Koreans young and old hanging out among the memorials impressive monuments and rest areas,Positive,0.6741,Positive

2625,4.0,This memorial is comprehensive assembly of the military history of Korea and tribute to the veterans The best parts of the museum are those devoted to the Korean war At times I wish it had gone deeper into the history and the sequence of battles You can spend about as long at the museum as you like if you really dig into all the stories and testimonies That said sometimes those testimonies are shallow and lack detail Some knowledge of the sequence of the battles in the Korean war certainly helps one to appreciate the different displays It is a bit disjointed in its presentation in that some parts seem to be chronologically out of sequence You do get a real sense of the feeling of violation to be invaded by a hostile neighbor and the sacrifice that was made which at times appeared to be a losing cause fortunately it did not end that way In that sense the memorial is an effective tribute Outside it has a very extensive collection of military hardware including tanks and aircraft This site is easily reached by subway and food is available on site,Positive,0.296,Positive

2643,5.0,With so many good reviews I wasnt sure I could add value with one more but I do think there are a couple important points First it is not a Korean War Memorial and by that I mean it is not just about what westerners think of as the Korean War It is a memorial to many more battles and wars going back thousands of years Second the admission is free and there are free guided tours as well When we went there were two options for a free tour at 10 AM  the official one and one given by a volunteer from Visit Seoul Walking Tours We chose the volunteer At first we wondered if we made the right choice since his English was not quite as good as the official guide but he gave us a longer more indepth and quite a personal tour If you are pressed for time go with the official tour If you have the time go with the volunteer guide,Positive,0.9752,Positive

2704,4.0,The Korean war memorial is a deifinite visit though it feels a little off putting knowing that it is surrounded by American military bases and the westerner district it gives you the sense that this may not really be as Korean as you might believe The pieces are exquisite and the layering of pieces is amazing as you start at the bottom in the ancient era and ascend to the modern The Korean war section is excellent though filled with tons of propoganda and from that point on you feel as if the museum is slowly turning into one giant recruitment strategy but aside from this biasis nature you are in for a treat as you Korean history come to life,Positive,0.5267,Positive

2816,5.0,The best memorial ever Very moving This tells you a lot about the Korean war and all of the countries that contributed to help South Korea Over 4 million casualties by the end of the war This was built on land that was donated back to South Korea from our military at the end of the war They decided to build this monstrocity which is hard to believe the size until you are there A lot of time and money in this place with ships planes jets tanks bronze statuesyou name it they have it and the quality of the memorial is second to nothing else that I have ever seen We have a friend that is stationed there for 3 years and he met us there and toured us around You need to visit this memorial while you are in South Korea,Positive,-0.4588,Negative
2817,5.0,Pretty cool museum Lots of multimediainteractive displays Classic and contemporary art pieces dedicated to the men and women who fought for their countrys freedom What an awesome memorial to their soldiers and the soldiers of the countries whove helped them The building complex itself is very grand and impressive This would especially be an awesome place to bring a Korean war veteran And kids tooNo wonder Korean people have such love for their country Im Filipino and just seeing our flag their makes me proud ,Positive,0.9832,Positive
2818,5.0,So the Palace is very big and well built The historical documents are accurate enough to learn how things went if you dont know the history of the war with North Korea Look out for the free English guided tours  Even more interesting is the outside They have a huge number of planes and tanks on display And even a ship Theres also a freaking B52 in all its mighty glory How cool is that   The only negative thing are the battle reconstruction shown Theyre supposed to give you the idea of how hard these were But to western standards theyre extremely kitsch campstyle displays of grindhouse style cgi explosions,Positive,0.2091,Positive
2819,5.0,An excellent museum well laid out you need to allow at least a couple of hours if you want to do it properly It gives you a good insight into koreas war torn past and the suffering of the people Its free to get in and outside there is plenty of war machinery for kids young and old to climb over,Positive,0.0772,Positive
2820,5.0,While there are other exhibits in this museum the bulk of it deals with the Korean War Obviously this was a huge event for Korea and you wont find a more in depth presentation than its home country Of particular note are the various displays of the countries that helped SKorea repel the NKorean invasion as well as various dioramas and exhibits detailing the weaponry battles and equipment  To get to the memorial I believe you get off at Itaewon and look for the exit for the War Memorial Once you pass a Korean military facility youre on the right track Admission is free and I really think this is a must see for anyone interested in military history,Positive,-0.4404,Negative

2824,5.0,I had the pleasure of visiting this museum during my twoyear tour to Korea This museum is phenomenal I cannot tell you how many times I was moved to tears by this place The history here is rich and very sad One country torn in two by foreign entities and forced to fight each other brother on brother Families were ripped from each others arms cities were leveled and peace was never achieved The stories that come out of this museum are powerful especially the story of the two brothers Anyone who visits Korea MUST visit this museum It is located in Yongsan it is quite easy to reach by train and cab,Positive,0.7402,Positive
2825,5.0,Im not really a museum person but this museum is incredible Every exhibit is so wellcrafted that even the most unenthusiastic visitor will be interested There are interactive exhibits videos walkthrough lifesize reenactment rooms with flashing lights and explosion sounds and even 4D rides Every exhibit video and experience has perfect informative Englishnone of that shortened Engrish we see so often in other museums  The 4D experiences were my favorite part of the museum and very kidfriendly In addition to being immensely entertaining they were also surprisingly informative The Operation Chromite experience is the most fun explaining the Battle of Incheon Theres another experience not 4D where viewers watch a short film about the harsh winter marches while the room gets cold and fake snow falls Bring a jacket  Even with all the interesting and fun bits the museum still manages to impart the somber and sometimes horrified feelings of the Korean War That said some parts do seem very propaganday so dont be surprised if your kids walk out saying they want to join the South Korean army,Positive,0.8494,Positive
2826,4.0,I found the war memorial very informational with pictures documents artifacts scaled models etc It has a large section on the Korean war but also many of the wars that happened before that You could spend hours going through the exhibits and learn a lot about the history of Korea  I would highly recommend anyone who visits South Korea to visit the war memorial,Positive,-0.9093,Negative
2827,5.0,Part Korean military history part thank you to the world this venue is not to be missed The memorial of the Korean conflict on our own National Mall is an embarrassment compared to this impressive building Set aside a morning and learn of this nations pain and hope,Positive,0.3946,Positive
2828,5.0,My wife  I visited the Korean war memorial  the first thing that you see is the monument dedicated to the soldiers of the conflict To either side of that monument is two statues reflecting some scenes of the conflict I found the place very quiet which is a chance to remind yourself how destructive  futile wars are on both sides Once you walk across the large courtyard into the building there is several options inside to visit As you enter the building the main Korean War section is on your left  that is very well documented  gives a concise explanation on how the conflict evolved There are several other exhibitions at the War Memorial  if you have the time it is well worth having a look at them Entrance is free As you exit the main complex there is a exhibition of helicopters airplanes tanks  boatsships used in the conflict They are in good order  whilst Im not a fan of war machinery I do like aircraft  you can get up close  check out the cockpits  workings of the aircraft A bit like the PIMA museum at Tucson Arizona You can use the city tour bus to get there or use the public transport  get of at Samgakji,Positive,-0.9466,Negative

2830,5.0,Recently visited the War Memorial of Korea and came away mightily impressed with everything that was put up here This is easily a top attraction in Seoul and highly recommendable not just for military buffs but also for those interested to know more about the separation of the North and South Koreas It is also a very childfriendly attraction Of course the outdoor exhibition area with the warship aircraft and armored vehicles etc should not be missed but there is also plenty to appreciate in the exhibition halls that require a good investment of time  Visited on a Saturday and thought the crowds were manageable It was quite bustling with a music concert in the Peace Plaza front of the building as well as a small classical concert in the Memorial Hall  There is so much to love about this attraction which not only gives a touching tribute to those who lost their lives for Korea but also succeeds to inform visitors about the countrys military history There are poignant monuments about which are worth seeing The entrance through the side galleries have walls inscribed with names of the fallen while there are other various symbolic works inside the exhibition area The historical information and war memorabilia seem comprehensive and not only covers the war between the Koreas but also wars dating back to the dynasties Displays are wellspaced and the route is marked and has a nice flow and there are a variety of historical items paintings dioramas and interactive media to keep one moving while the captions are kept short but substantial Occasionally there were points that were repetitive but this only served to reinforce the information presented  Some tips  How to get there Samgakji Station Line 4 or Line 6 Exit 12  The memorial is open from 9am to 6pm and closed on Mondays except public holiday and closed the day after a Monday public holiday  Admission is free This attraction runs on donations and visitors are welcome to use the donation boxes for this purpose  Be sure to grab a brochure at the entrance which has summaries of each section and all you need to explore the Memorial  Free baby carriagewheel chair for use  Photography is allowed in most areas save for the 3D4D presentations  The 3D4D presentations run every 30minutes and tend to be popular but have limited seats which could be a problem during weekend visits  The website has a good amount of information and could help prepare for a visit here such as targeting items or areas of interest  The War Memorial of Korea is truly worth at least 3 hours but you could easily spend more if you have the time Its grand scale reflects the importance of wars in the history of this country while befitting the great significance placed on those who died to make the Republic of Korea what it is today,Positive,0.9975,Positive
2831,5.0,I almost didnt make it to this memorial was pressed for time but I am so glad that I did There was so much information I was really impressed It was very interactive and captured the history of Koreas military activities from way back to the present I arrived there at 5 so I only had an hour to spare because the museum closes at 6 I will definitely be coming back here on my next trip as there was so much that I didnt get to see One could easily spend 23 hours here as there is so much on display Admission is free but they accept donations which I happily gave because they deserve it One of the highlights of my trip,Positive,0.9852,Positive

2834,3.0,I spent some time at the memorial in preparation for my trip to the DMZ While the building and the displays were impressive the loud and rowdy school kids on their field trip made the experience less enjoyable Seriously where were the adults supervising the students They were running around knocking things over and talking during the movie presentations While I understand that they are kids this place is also a memorial to the soldiers of the Korean War The staff should enforce more decorum among its visitors out of respect The English tour guide was friendly but his English was difficult to understand so I left the tour group half way through and just explored on my own Overall a nice memorial and museum and I learned a lot about the war I would suggest maybe going on a weekend when there wont be so many students,Negative,-0.3522,Negative
2835,5.0,Wherever I go I always go to the War Memorial or War museum Canberra Ottawa Warsaw ect This one in Seoul I would rank as one of the best one If you like history or have kids do not miss it I went there with my son and we send more than 4 hours time was flying and we had to rush to see other things in Seoul We could spend the whole day there There is a lot of history of dividing a nation which wants to be together and human suffering as well as military equipment to satisfy anyone who likes these things,Positive,0.4667,Positive
2836,5.0,Our family visited the War Memorial of Korea and the trip was way above our expectations This memorial has to be one of the best weve ever visited There is so much to see and do inside and out The staff is very courteous arrows on the floor throughout the museum guiding you through every floor every exhibit Best part All of the vehicles airplanes boats ship etc were hands on If youve visited a museum in the US most wont let you get ten feet near the displays but here the kids can play on the motorcycles cars tanks you name it The WM of K also has a very nice caf\xc3\xa9 inside bathrooms throughout every floor and vending machines priced the same as in the subway or anywhere else throughout the museum We spent a few hours there but easily could have brought or bought a lunch and spent the better part of a day The highlight Being able to climb sit steer and touch all of the military vehicles etc The cost is free Definitely worth the visit,Positive,0.9857,Positive

2838,5.0,Having a late uncle who spent significant time in Korea during the war years this war memorial had special significance for me A most serene setting that encompasses the essence of the war between the North and the South  no shortage of old military equipment If you have had a family member take part in this war or if you are a war history buff then do yourself a favour take an hour or two and spend some time here PS its worthwhile taking your camera  lots of opportunities for some great shots,Positive,-0.5868,Negative
2839,4.0,Perhaps it is because technically the country is still at war with the North that the museum seems so alive and pertinent  Lots of planes and tanks to climb over or into which provide interest for those of an academic bent or for kids enjoying the thrill of getting close up to big machinery  Inside the exhibits offer a sense of a long history served in an entertaining manner with lots of audio visual displays  A real surprise and a suitable day trip for the family,Positive,0.9075,Positive
2840,5.0,I think I make time to stop by here whenever I visit Seoul If you are interested in Korean history this is a mustsee place along with the National Museum in Seoul  There are nice sculptures around the premises and the facilities are well maintained and clean They even have lockers near the inside entrance across from the bookstore and cafe I think the lockers were free Admission is usually free as well  If youre the type who likes to read and soak in everything you will need a good 23 hours to see most of the displays It will benefit you if you can read Korean though as most of the exhibits have little English descriptions a few didnt have any English The film rooms were interesting with informative documentaries again most are in only spoken Korean though  It will definitely give you a better understanding of why Koreans think the way they do when you see how the country has frequently been wartorn throughout its 5000 years of history,Positive,0.9846,Positive
2841,5.0,this was about 30 min cab ride from downtown Seoul gangham area and it was worth the ride  first it was free admission running on donations The amount of items here is just mind boggling It was really great to see planes such as B52 tanks and helicopters that were used in the war  I spent a good 4 hours here and left satisfied You could easily spend all day here  If you had family that passed in the war there is nice memorial in the front of all members KIA from all countries  The amount of information given really put the war in perspective,Positive,0.2168,Positive

2862,4.0,As an American who knew very little about the Korean War this was a very educational experience The museum talks about all of the wars on the Korean peninsula over the past several centuries but has a much larger focus on the Korean War of the early 1950s The museum is well laid out and gives a good overview of the wars There was even a 3D motion simulator movie showing you what it would be like in a fighter plane of the time Outside of the museum there is a large collection of airplanes helicopters tanks and other military equipment used in the Korean War I learned a lot about the war here and Im very happy I took the time out of my vacation to visit,Positive,-0.89,Negative

2864,5.0,Im not really into war museums in general though this was very informative and not too manly I learned a lot about the history of the wars in Korea including the ongoing Korean War with North Korea The museum is well laid out and has some interesting 4D experiences Most exhibits and movies were also available in English  Great value Audio guide was great,Positive,0.8821,Positive
2865,5.0,Very large and interesting museum It gives an overview of the military history of Korea and focuses specifically on the Korean war of the 50s The suggested visiting time of 12 h as stated in Tripadvisor is far from sufficient in my opinion If you want also to experience the 4D movies and interactive parts of the museum you will need much more time as all these things are on the same time schedule at 30 minutes interval Therefore you will need several hours just for those parts Tips  if youre low on time start with the movies and interactive parts as soon as you get in  Take note of the fact that the interactive parts are not available from 12h00 till 13h30  Do not forget the outside it is not on the map,Positive,-0.2664,Negative
2866,5.0,I am so glad we went here This is the equivalent of the Vietnam Korea and WWII memorial in DC mixed in with a military armament museum The plaques for the fallen listed by nationality and even States in the case with the US; seeing all those lost souls names inscribed under the UN banner really makes you appreciate what the world can do right when we come together Those brave men and women gave their lives for something greater than themselves or their nation Wow just amazing The statues and memorials are well done and give you the feeling of how hard Korea has had it They trace the history of this war torn country and walk you through today The building itself is an appropriate tribute but then they added so much military hardware you can spend days looking at this equipment One of my favorite parts was the north Korean equipment provided by Russia and China Makes you realize that when there is war there is usually only 2 sides; but in reality the sides fighting are usually a proxy for those countries supplying the arms Much of the information presented is in English If in Seoul and you have any interest in how Korea came to be; this is a must see,Positive,0.4728,Positive
2867,4.0,The huge ground displays statues boats airplanes and helicopters which look very captivating Utilizes their grounds well as they provide outdoor and indoor exhibits Landscape of the place is well kept Benches seating areas are provided in the grounds Vending machine is visible outdoor  Admission to this place is free English tour is provided Devout couple of hours to tour the place as it is interesting and informative utilizing multimedia short films of 510 minutes display of war remains with English translation pictures and life size statues  Recommending this as one of the place to visit when in Seoul for all ages,Positive,0.765,Positive
2868,3.0,Im still not sure how i should think about it It is a giant building which is even of architectural views interesting Also there is an impressive collection of planes and tanks as well as a ship But in the end it is about war and i really missed the part where they tell how much the people suffer in the war Dead and shortages are big part they left away and it seems that this glorifies the war,Negative,-0.9792,Negative
2869,3.0,This is an essential place to visit to understand Koreas history of warfare including but not limited to the Korean War However while everything is here somewhere it it poorly laid out and signposted We struggled to find the 3rd floor Combat Room which claims to offer some sort of lifelike experience but this 5 minute experience was underwhelming to say the least  particularly when you think about how special effects are used today in cinema and games  and the same general criticism can be levelled at many of the exhibits which seem rather dated Best is the contemporary footage from the Korean war Our visit was not helped by Seoul Councils decision to turn off the ac in its public buildings to save electricity  this just made the place even more stifling inside than it was outside,Negative,-0.7718,Negative
2870,5.0,If you are minimally interested in History particularly postWWII history this place is a must It houses an amazing collection of items from the Korean War maybe one of the only moments were the cold war actually went pretty hot and also has a quite interactive way of telling its story Everything is at least bilingual KoreanEnglish though most of the exhibits also have Chinese and Japanese versions There are a couple of 4D cinemas; and displays of actual tanks airplanes missiles and other war crafts which make the visitors feel the war much more realistically And all of this for free though make sure to buy some little souvenir or donate some money These guys work hard and provide an amazing service,Positive,0.2732,Positive
2871,5.0,My goal was to spend two hours here I ended up staying four and could have absolutely done more The english speaking tour was one of the most impressive and informative tours I have ever been on Humor insight and it was obvious how much this man cared about this country Even if you dont get a chance to go into the musuem the outside planes and statues are worth the stop Do not miss this,Positive,0.7843,Positive
2872,3.0,I unfortunately could only get to the memorial on a Monday when the museum is closed I did see the exterior exhibits I found the display unordered with only very basic English explanations The Korean could have been more detailed The exhibition includes quite a few aircraft tanks some missiles and AA guns and some other heavy military equipment unfortunately the exhibits look deteriorated and dirty I did enjoy some of the impressive statues In short if you have the time and enjoy this kind of attraction you should put the memorial somewhere on your list of sites to see in Seoul,Negative,0.6915,Positive
2873,4.0,Really pleased that we went to visit this national memorial It was a great tribute to the Korean people and was very balanced in presenting the South Korean perspective of a divisive war  Certainly worth a visit if you are in the area,Positive,0.7713,Positive
2874,5.0,You will learn more about the war that isnt taught nor told in America as it really was and still is The memorial documents that it was an acted out conflict between the US and Russia and Korea was split without their say or input After 3 years of war South Koreans were dissatisfied with the division and wanted to go all the way as to ride it out to keeping the country One Other interesting exhibits are uniforms from foreign officers who ended up in Korea during the late 19th century Knowing from visiting HaemiEupsa that Catholicism was brought to Korea in the late 19th century this correlated with military history of Britian America Spain and a few other Western countries visiting Korea proposing trade relations There are also really cool medieval times exhibits that give you a sense that Korea and most of the world were at the same level of technology which still is The only differences are food language and customs as well as military and political situations,Positive,-0.7804,Negative

2876,5.0,Like many of the other reviews mention this is a free museum other than some seasonal special exhibitsas but you can give a donation when you enter Outside there way quite a collection of military vehicles including tanks helicopters large aircraft and more  The inside of the museum was equally as interesting and certainly added a new or rather deeper vantage point than any textbook from school I remember There are tonnes of displays with accompanying English descriptions All very well organised and enjoyable to walk through  There are several free short 3d films that can be watched each lasting about 10 minutes or so As well as some other activities to participate in and photo spots  I only spent about two hours there which really isnt enough time to absorb everything If youre really understood in history then it could easily eat up a majority of your day,Positive,0.9817,Positive

2883,3.0,In order to remember the Korean War and commemorate the war heroes the War Memorial of Korea was established It is a museum that houses various records of the war It also serves as lessons from the war to stimulate patriotism and military spirit amongst the Korean  The museum consists of both indoor and outdoor exhibition areas The indoor ones provide visitors a glimpse into the activities during the Korean War while the outdoor ones have memorial statues and military vehicles  More on blog post httpwwwkenwooicom201307warmemorialofkoreahtml,Negative,-0.9612,Negative
2884,4.0,So off the bat the outdoor display of military hardware is most impressive and would Wow any little boys or grown men who are into that stuff We spent a little while perusing the tanks planes missiles etc Then we moved inside Huge building The huge open space in front of the building devoid of any greenery reminds me of the grounds of the palaces we had visited the previous days I think Koreans just seem to love that grand sweeping open space to show case the main act  the building itself Hence no trees shrubberies or flowers in the immediate front of the building to distract ones eyes The museum have exhibits of Korean military history that goes back very far  like to 900 AD or maybe even further back As far as they have records of I guess Of course back that far it wasnt Korea as we know it today The land mass that is modern day N  S Korea hosted various kingdoms and fiefdoms whose borders fluctuated and changed many times You also get the sense that the official narrative wants to put a very proud and positive spin on Korean military achievement As with the various other museums we went into prior to this one the Koreans are not so great with putting any of the accompanying texts displayed in English Which is frustrating and perplexing since one would think that they would jump at the chance to educate visitors on their rich history  culture Instead one is left feeling very blah about whatever potentially interesting things we might be viewing since we have no idea what it is or its significance The English when there is any would be like 2 sentences long and then the Korean part would be whole paragraphs long  erm I think theyre saying way more than the English translation here Surely they can hire someone who can translate this stuff Anyway this might have been 5 stars if it wasnt for the lack of English in the exhibits Same goes for all the museums in Seoul that we went to,Positive,0.9857,Positive

2901,4.0,Youll have to wait 30 min or more for a 7minute movie which is the most ridiculous thing in the world Youre not waiting because there are many people ahead but because they need to clean and sterilize the 4D glasses after each showing at least thats what it seemed to us Despite this ridiculousness the simulator is worth the wait It feels as if you were there in one of the planes Wont say more because I dont want to spoil it Bottom line is its worth it and you should do it Museum is completely free no entry fee,Positive,0.8697,Positive

2910,4.0,Decided to come here on a stinking hot day with a friend to escape outside heat and as usual with these types of places I underestimated the size of the place and spent a good few hours running around the various exhibitions exhausted  Its totally free which is always a plus and has three floors all of which are completely packed with all sorts of war things videos touch screens etc I have sort of forgotten what exactly the exhibits were but almost all of the museum is dedicated to the Korean war There is a little bit dedicated to subsequent world wars such as Vietnam and iraq etc but expect to mostly see stuff about the korean war here and be prepared to take it all in and learn about what really happened in Seoul and Korea  Some of the highlights from my four or so hours at this great venue are as follows  1 the 4d cinema which tells the story of Korea evacuating at the time Seoul was about to fall to northern Korean soldiers 2 The various interactive screens that allow you to take photos and email them to yourself 3 the outside display of aircraft such as B52 f4 phantom helicopters 4 A display that to ok place in the main courtyard of the museum which had at least 100 performers It was quite amazing as the 30 minute show started with a sword fight between soldiers dressed in those colourful and famous Korean military outfits The display then moved through the years and ended up with maching bands gunshots and a all the forces represented in a fun display At the end of the display they spent a good 30 minutes posing for photos with anyone who wanted  Overall it was an interesting experience that taught me alot about Korea and the show at the end was a highlight although I dont think the show happens every day so if you see it make sure you watch the whole thing  Plenty of bathrooms and water fountains about as well as 2 cafes that had reasonably priced food,Positive,0.9811,Positive
2911,3.0,No entrance fee Very accessible from subway station The exterior of the lawns has this display of old war planes and tanks and you can walk inside the planes Kids will enjoy this Inside they offer a free english guide The history sounds interesting but we could hardly hear the guide He had a soft voice plus you can hear the other groups too I think it would be better to read some of the history of the korean war then join the english tour as a supplement for one to better appreciate the museum,Negative,0.8674,Positive

2916,5.0,After living and sightseeing around Seoul for over a year I can honestly say this museum is one of my favorite things in the whole city I expected it to be just a regular museum where you look at artifacts behind glass and thats it but this was so much more My husband and I spent hours at the museum and walked away with so much more knowledge about the Korean war and other Korean history as well The inside of the museum is displayed in a very creative and interesting way as you wonder through different eras of time or parts of the war We even got our own free private English tour guide who was a Korean war refugee as a child to give us an hour long tour and learned even more some it first hand about the war time The outside of the museum is just as interesting as the inside with so many planes helicopters boats tanks etc set up several of which you can climb inside of I definitely recommend this museum,Positive,0.8744,Positive

2920,5.0,This place is simply amazing and this is not because it is free admission From the look of the building it looks a bit like Capitol Hill or some advanced government building to the real life examples of various military equipment located in the lawn including real lifesized planes tanks and artiliary of both the US and Korean military one could spend at least one full day here if you care to look at all the exhibit both inside and outside One will definately be more appreciative of the deep military ties between US and South Korea and the Korean War We also saw school children visiting the place which is probably part of their school programme to learn more about the history of the country Definately worth the visit and you can take as many pictures as you want Note that the memorial is not located near any other mainstream tourist attractions and it is about a 5 minute walk from the subway station,Positive,0.9571,Positive

2923,5.0,I went here based on good reviews and was surprisingly impressed I only had a couple of hours before it closed but I could have spent much more time here It is not the typical war museums with only handsoff exhibits There are plenty of tanks aircraft ship and other war transports outside the museum Inside the brochureguide leads you through well laid out hands on exhibits My favorites included 3D and 4D films think snow wind and 3D glasses about what it was like to be in camps and evacuated practice gun shoots audio recordings large movie screen video clips and an interactive photo booth where you can take pics of yourself in military uniforms outside the museum and then email them to yourself right there all for free This place is amazing and best of all its free Definitely worth a visit,Positive,0.9933,Positive

2934,4.0,We went there on a cold winters morning It took us awhile to finish looking at the memorials outside and displays of all the military vehicles Almost all of these were centered around the Korean War It was nice to see inside had many different areas Starting with ancient times and ancient warfare through the dealings of Korea with various different world powers through history Japanese occupation and of course the Korean War were big focus point I already knew a great deal about this history but even if I didnt the exhibits are set up in a way which introduces the history and events of the war step by step Even if you knew nothing about the history it is all there for you in movies pictures exhibits and reading They also have sections dedicated to the peacekeeping missions of the Korean military a section on the Vietnam war and some exhibits about the future I saw a LOT of Korean soldiers on a field trip around Countless groups of about 20 students following around their instructor In one point I scampered to get out of their way and the sergeant addressed me in English asking me to come feel the vibration of a simulator I felt awfully singled out There wasnt much for sale inside the museum but on the grounds is a souvenier shop a convenience store and a food place I bought my dad a souvenir piece of barbed wire from the DMZ thinking it would be cheaper than AT the DMZ it was perhaps 25000 won I found it the next day for 15000 won wasnt pleased,Positive,0.5008,Positive

2937,5.0,I enjoyed the War Memorial much more than I expected As you walk to the entrance you see the names of the fallen memorialized in the walls Its always a solemn and sobering thing to remember how violent the human race can be Then you step inside and find yourself among the various exhibits chronicling Korean history The displays turned out to be quite fascinating and very detailed Even if you just spend an hour or so as we did you can come away with a full appreciation for the beauty and the ugliness that has shaped the country into what it is now,Positive,-0.228,Negative
2938,5.0,This is a museum and memorial to the korea wars There is a hall of all US soldiers who died in the Korean war There are three floors starting with the wars of Korea in the distant past all the way to the recent threats by North Korea THe exhibits are in chronological order with an amazing hall of remembrance for both the foreign soldiers who fought and died forwith korea and a hall for the korean soldiers Inside is an amazing collection of uniforms equipment and scenes from wars dating back to the bronze age all the way to the bombs and weaponry of today Outside are planes tanks helicoptersall of this free It worth the 3 or more hours to take it all in They also have a live exhibit with a traditional korean wedding It is a very interesting peaceful reflective place to spend the afternoon,Positive,-0.8424,Negative

2940,4.0,This museum is powerful for those unfamiliar with the war and military history of Korea They do have a lot of interactive exhibits but all but two of them were closed during our visit Theres a lot of reading to do so it might be good to go on two different occasions while on your way to other things Walking through the battleship outside and walking up on the castle walls on the inside were my two favourite things,Positive,0.4854,Positive
2941,5.0,I was mainly attracted to the large number of tanks and aircraft including a shot up boat  they have sitting outside the memorial  But the inside we equally impressive and if you are a war buff then you could easily spend a day here We didnt do the DMZ tour so this was the compromise  Much to our surprise and delight they had a show in the main square of the memorial with ancient fighters and changing of the guard for modern military At the end of it they had photo ops with everyone You could tell they were really focusing on tourists which was great Even some mascots there for the kids  If you go here it is about 1 bus stop from Itaewon the foreigner area of Seoul so definitely on the tourist track,Positive,0.9663,Positive

2943,5.0,Prepare for your visit by reflecting that Korea always been threatened on the west by China and on the east by Japan a shrimp between two whales is an ancient Korean metaphor Thus much of Korean history has to do with warfare with one or both of these powers If you already are familiar with the basics of Korean history you know something of Admiral Yi Sun Shin who in the 1590s stymied Japanese invasions led by Hideyoshi in part by his revival and redesign of Koreas turtle boats the worlds first armored warships There is a scale model of a turtle boat in the museum for your contemplation Even aside from his use of turtle boats though Yi a brilliant admiral by any standard hes been compared favorably to Nelson is the preeminent naval hero of Korea But my point here is this Koreas military history is represented chronologically by statues of her heroes beginning in a circular room with statuary surrounding a huge fountain under a skylight easily the most beautiful fountain Ive ever seena shrine really so take off your hat and allow it to work its mood on you Now notice that Yi Sun Shin of the 16th Century is not even included in this inner sanctum but is relegated to the rows of statues outside leading to it This is deep history folks; about 4000 years worth of a single culture coming together out of separate and warring kingdoms Youve seen downtown Seoul Myongdong Itaewon the palaces Nam San Now devote an afternoon just a few hours to experience the roots of this magnificent country and people,Positive,0.9857,Positive

2945,4.0,This has a wedding hall as a part of the grounds which I found a bit odd  Moving past that it is a great memorial as it lists everyone who died in the Korean War and also had a museum for past wars and an area to look at touch and get in old airplanes and such,Positive,-0.8519,Negative
2946,4.0,If youre in Seoul you have to stop at this museum My concierge originally had no idea what I was talking about so Im not sure how frequent of a stop it is for many tourists But its worth a visit  The museum is set up very well and the designated walking path guides you through the history of war in Korea from prehistoric times to present The exhibits were informative and interesting Free entry too,Positive,0.5685,Positive

2948,5.0,I walked to the museum 1015 minutes from the Namyeong station passing the USO along the way Useful to know if you plan on doing the DMZ tour The first thing you notice are the monuments and statues outside  they really set the tone for some of the sad and poignant stories you read about inside As an English speaker I was concerned that I would become disinterested due to the lack of translation On the contrary the visitor guide outlined all the exhibits in a very clear and concise manner  with English translations though brief accompanying most artifacts The outdoor display of equipment which allows you to get up close and personal is a great way to end the tour All in all a tremendous museum and a mustsee for anyone remotely interested in military history As good as any museum youll find in London  yes im referring to you Imperial War Museum,Positive,0.8357,Positive
2949,4.0,I visited the memorial with a colleague on a recent business trip As others have commented the museum is spread across the different wars that have impacted South Korea The museum is well laid out with many displays and artefacts lots of English descriptions Outside there are planes ships and other large memorabilia The museum is free and great for both adults and kids alike If you have a spare 23 hours then I highly recommend this,Positive,0.8268,Positive

2953,5.0,I spent a more than three hours at this museum clearly not enough because I just had time to take a quick look at the outdoor displays where you find fighters tanks boats and even a real B52 Stratofortress  First this museum is easy to find and free of charge You can get an pamphlet in English at the entrance In case you need energy before long walking hours or a break during or after the visit you can find sanwiches and drinks in a small cafeteria The gift shop is a disappointment small and almost no books in English not even one on the Korean War  The inside exhibits are well organized easy to follow The Korean War takes a big section of two floors with key points in English photos artefacts dioramas and so on There are also an 3D movie and a shooting game which make up the fun part of the visit  Too bad that I could not take a guided tour However I was lucky to come on a Friday in May where there was a marching parade which was just awesome  If you come to visit Seoul dont miss the War Memorial Museum,Positive,0.7868,Positive

2964,5.0,I went here with my husband the same day I visited the National Museum of Korea The bottom floor has an overview of early battles Korea was involved in with the top 2 floors focused on the Korean War Even though we had already spent 3 hours at the National Museum of Korea and were a little tired the War Memorial of Korea was able to keep our attention for 3 more hours and the only reason we left as soon as we did was because the museum was closing I hadnt expected the museum itself to be so extensive and it gave a really great background of the history of Korea and helped me understand Koreas relationship with North Korea today The English translations were great and the museum was arranged in a way that made it easy to follow and learn And it was free,Positive,0.7491,Positive

2974,5.0,A very comprehensive museum Its not just the Korean War of the 1950s but other wars from the past However as expected the Korean War is significant In fact the essence of the Korean War was captured by the sculpture at the entrance of two brothers  on opposing sides  embracing on the battlefield  This is a must visit for anyone interested in Korea Its sad but somehow offers hope It gives one a little more understanding what the Korean people have gone through in the past,Positive,-0.9542,Negative

2976,5.0,There is a lot to be said for a country when you see what type of War Memorial it has and the Seoul one is most impressive From the memorials out the front to the ship planes tanks and other weapons on the side just a walk outside is worthwhile Inside there is three floors of well presented displays and exhibits some are 3 or 4D You can easily spend several hours here,Positive,0.4005,Positive
2977,5.0,This was a super surprise to us We left this as a Fill In museum for when we got bored and had some extra time It turned out to be one of the highlights of the trip  They have an AMAZING array of miliraty weaponry vehicles tanks aircraft missiles guns jeeps boats etc Most of which you can let the kids climb on and in for photos and to get out some energy Great photo ops inside and out  The inside themed displays were better than any museum we have seen short of the Smithsonian Hands on displays video players and short clip videos nearly everywhere telling small stories of the era being displayed most with actual footage and extremely well done graphics  Three stories of outstanding displays a MUST SEE And it is all 100 free  They have QR codes to scan all over the museum to hear the narrative about each section or item but unfortunately the narrative is only in Korean Take the time to find out when an english tour is happening and join them It will be well worth it  The inside exhibits are not geared toward small children but the outside displays are prefect for all ages,Positive,0.9538,Positive

2981,4.0,Whilst some think of Korean war as abridged season 2 of WW II or even spinoff It was a short yet intense war that cause as much emotional and physical damage  This museum is collection and reminder from these warsand also from older days Exhibition is well made and external exhibition is also pretty good which includes B52albeit older model You cannot go inside the plane however,Positive,-0.4404,Negative
2982,5.0,Exhibits are well done and the area to see the tankswar planes is also very neat but the best way to do this museum is getting a guided tour to learn the history and hear a perspective on current events between N Korea and S Korea A MUST in Seoul,Positive,0.8589,Positive

2986,5.0,I spent the best part if a full day here Admission is free and they have English guides There was some much its hard to list but if you are in Seoul dont miss out The exhibits are very well displayed and have English descriptions Children would particularly enjoyed the planes tanks etc and not forgetting the rifle range which they would really enjoy This memorial is very educational I loved the speaker banks that were placed in the demilitarized zone to broadcast into North Korea,Positive,0.9769,Positive

3003,5.0,This was one of the finest war museums which I have ever visited It had dioramas of the Korean War that clearly showed what the war was like for civilians as well as the military It let the visitor experience what the war was like It was well laid out The outside also had an exhibit of planes missiles tanks and other Korean War artifacts We went there in December and it was bitterly cold outside with a covering of snow but it was definitely worth a visit despite the weather,Positive,-0.2263,Negative
3004,5.0,It consists of two parts  one is museum  which is mostly like any other museum and contains some boring stuff mostly for display product from stone age paintings and things like that Fun begins at the 2nd part which consists of real tanks fighter planes for display This place is really awesome and you get to see these things in real They are however very old but still real Very nice place to spend time,Positive,0.8789,Positive

3007,3.0,Probably on of the best museums youll find about the Korean War with some caveats First its helpful to know something about the Korean War before you visit Second however it may have started out this Museum is no longer completely about the Korean conflict of 195053 Third the help South Korea got from the US and the UN is somewhat understated and the focus seems to be on South Korean suffering and heroes The multimedia presentations are most all in Korean but at least they usually have subtitles  The outdoor displays are excellent but again include weapons that did not play in the Korean War  A major disappointment for me was the Dokdo display highlighting an ongoing territorial dispute with Japan Not surprising from the ultranationalistic Koreans but totally inappropriate in what should be a memorial for the thousands who sacrificed for their freedom Save your grudges for a booth at the airport Adashi  A whole section seems to be devoted to promoting the modern Korean Arms Industry Didnt detract from the visit my guests enjoyed it but Really  Do NOT expect to get a comprehensive knowledge of the Korean War from this museum  Pluses admission is free easily accessible by subway Samgakchi Station,Negative,0.8564,Positive

3012,5.0,My wife and I just came back from the Korean War Memorial The museum was closed but we were able to walk around and view the outdoor display of war machines on hand It was really good even though we were not able to enter all the exhibits so I can imagine it would be wonderful if you go and they are open,Positive,0.7808,Positive

3014,4.0,While the main thrust of the museum is the Korean War there is much here about many conflicts Korea has been in from the distant past through the modern day I definitly got a feel for how tragic the Korean War was on the Korean pennisula and how it echoes into today I missed the English guided tour but it looks like they are planning to add selfguided audio tours in the future This will be a nice addition If you are interested in the martial history of Korea this is a place to go Towards the end when I found myself getting hungry I found a cafe on the top floor which served some food and the proces were quite resonable,Positive,0.6597,Positive
3015,4.0,We visited the War MemorialMuseum twice during our stay as there was a lot to take in Just around the corner from the American military base and with 11 replicas of recent naval skirmishes with the north the War Memorial drives home the reality of what South Koreans are living with every day  The displays have plenty of english information and cover south korean military history back to feudal times There are tanks ships and planes outside to walk around and photograph Understandably the main displays are on the Korean war which is presented well with interesting insights diplomatic cables personal stories and plenty of memorabilia Other displays include South Koreas involvement in the Vietnam war and more recent peacekeeping missions,Positive,-0.8839,Negative

3024,4.0,It is perhaps easy to forget walking the streets of Seoul that for much of the 20th century Seoul had been occupied by a foreign power and occasionally a battlefield From 19101945 Seoul was the headquarters of the Japanese colonial government From 195053 during the Korean War Seoul exchanged hands several times Incredible what a difference we see today 60 years later  The War Memorial of Korea comemorates both tragedies mentioned above but also focuses on conflicts centuries ago I enjoyed browsing the exhibits as well as the monuments outside the museum For visitors interested in military history this museum is a must The museum is primarily focused on the Jurchen War Imjin War Manchu Inavasion Colonial Period and the Korean War,Positive,-0.9246,Negative

3033,5.0,I have been to the memorial several times and still enjoy it It looks like Cecil B Demill sic would create A gigantic beautiful building that looks somewhat like it was in the movie Cleopatra houses many items big and small One of the two beautiful open wings have the names of the Korean soldiers killed and the other wing has the names of the Allied countries souldiers killed in action during the Korean War It is especially impressive as they have broken down the US soldiers by their their states The admission fee is very small Everything from a US B52 and a captured Northern Korean submarine are outside in the surrounding grounds Many captured weapon systems planes large guns and electronics are also there It is hard to believe a P51 is sitting outside in the weather Inside the building the place is packed and the use of different lighting is outstanding The recreated battle scenes in miniature are the best I have seen I could go on and on but I would be using the same positive words to describe this great museum Trust me on this one it is well worth a visit,Positive,0.9799,Positive

3039,5.0,The War Memorial of Korea is easy to find by exiting Exits 11 or 12 at the Samgakji subway stop You cant miss it with its imposing architecture and a large statue of a South Korean soldier hugging his adversary  This is an amazing place made more amazing because its free The grounds outside the Memorial is beautifully landscaped I felt very small as I approached the building with it towering ominously over me Inside not only does the Memorial teach about the Korean War they also did a fantastic job humanizing the conflict Never did I felt they glorified war This Memorial kept me thoroughly entertained for 3 to 4 hours  During my trip there were many young Korean soldiers there on what was apparently a company field trip  My only slight disappointment was that a wing of the museum was offlimits under renovation  When leaving I put a few thousand wons in the donation box Theres no way I can leave without paying anything for my many wellspent hours there,Positive,0.8194,Positive

3071,3.0,Pro; Very kids friendly Con didnt explain the reasons of the Korean war at all I was so curious But I think it could be because its such a political issue that you dont want the visitors from the other side of the war countries feel unwelcomed or hated But I still think there should be at least some basic objective tellings,Negative,-0.9135,Negative
3072,4.0,This museum is definitely worth a visit if you have an interest in military history or Korean history in general I was however disappointed in the lack of information on the Korean War The lower level deals wthe military history of Korea going back to their warring states period Then the upper floor deals wmodern warfare I was hoping to get more information of the war between what would become NS Korea Unfortunately it was very sparse Just the UN decision for America to help defend what would be SKorea Overall very nice,Positive,-0.7722,Negative
3073,5.0,With an 8hr stop over in Seoul I hopped on the train at Incheon and off to see the memorial It was well worth it and I could have stayed longer than the 3hrs I was there It was very interesting reading about the long history of conflicts in which the Koreans have been involved either actively or as peace keepers and especially the history of the more recent Nth KSth K stand off I would have enjoyed more time looking at the outside exhibits of the planes tanks and artillery but ran out of time If time for you has a a limit I suggest perhaps starting outside first then following the arrows inside where you can pick and choose what to spend more time reading about and skip past the things that interest you less Theyve done a great job putting it together and this is well recommended,Positive,0.9626,Positive

3079,5.0,Ill be the first to admit that Im probably not the one whos been to most museums but thats mostly because most museums Ive been at have failed to catch my true interest and attention When it first occurred to me Seoul had the War Memorial of Korea I thought to myself that it must at least be very informative when looking at Koreas huge history with war  And boy it didnt disappoint  Its easy to see its very influenced by USA lets ignore that and just appreciate the depth this museum has Not only is the museum huge it covers the older wars with their neighbors but also Vietnam it even had an exhibition about the Danish contribution to the Korean wars even though it wasnt a lot IN DANISH and whatever military struggle Koreas been in and theres a lot A lot of the displays are incredibly well made and most of it is in English so you dont have to be an expert in Hangul to appreciate it At the back of the museum theyve filled the yard with military vehicles tanks cannons helicopters and planes  Impressive museum And free,Positive,-0.292,Negative
3080,5.0,Really big need a few hours maybe 3 or 4 to really see the whole thing Loads of things to see inside as well as outside Gift shop and lockers I think free if you dont want to carry around your stuff Its a really nice memorial very moving and informative I have been here a few times and will probably go there again  Must do in Seoul Do it,Positive,0.8799,Positive

3084,4.0,Its a great way to spend a few hours and learn the history of the Korean War It was free when I went the last couple times Theyve greatly improved the area that talks about the Korean War in the museum since I first visited the museum in the 90s There is a 4D movie experience that shows how General MacArthur led Operation Chromite and its free; the drawback is that it is fairly short about 8 minutes and only 15 people can see it at a time Be prepared for a wait if you really want to see it Youre not really missing out if you dont see it Also theres a little shooting gallery that runs every so often and takes six people at a time You get 20 shots then they shoo you off,Positive,0.8717,Positive
3085,5.0,Overall this was a very good museum I was more interested in learning about the Japanese occupation of Korea This is not that so much as it is about the aftermath of Japans defeat in WWII Still there was a fun little 3D movie with motion seats in which Gen MacArthur was revealed as a brilliant strategist I never knew that but given the outcome I do thank him as do the people of South Korea I did not realize that the Korean war was ground zero at the time of the fight between communists and capitalism Very well done overall On the lower level there are minor displays of the many other invasions of Korea over the centuries with some beautiful costumes of the day Worth seeing,Positive,0.7982,Positive
3086,5.0,An amazing place A little trouble to get to but well worth the visit Incredible amount of war machines but little exact mention of recent history,Positive,-0.1664,Negative

3089,5.0,The bottom floor covers the preKorean war period Then there are two floors that we liked best which cover the Korean war and the period between 1953 and now They are very interesting and it will take you several hours to see them There are several short 2D 3D and 4D movies 4D  3D  some movement We loved the 7 minute 4D movie about Operation Chromite general MacArthurs sea landing at Incheon  Start with the planes and tanks parked outside to the right and make sure you dont miss the Soviet T34 and USA Sherman tanks parked next to each other Until now I always thought the T34s were much bulkier than the Shermans,Positive,0.8333,Positive
3090,3.0,While the scale of the war museum is large and invokes awe in its scale you do get stuck with the feeling that most of it is geared towards the Korean public I did though enjoy the historic artifacts of war There was also two new displays at the museum,Negative,-0.7269,Negative
3091,5.0,It is easy to spend a whole day here looking around The museum is very well put together and very thoughtful It tells the story of just not the most recent Korean war but all the conflicts that have played out on the Korean peninsula for the last centuries The signage is all bilingual in Korean and English maybe even French too Video footage is also subtitled or voice overed in English tearing down all language barriers Admission fee very reasonable to gain so much insight into Asian history Easy access by Samgakji subway or by taxi from YongsanItaewon area,Positive,0.8899,Positive
3092,3.0,I was surprised to find that the war history at this museum dates all the way back to ancient times I was just expecting a Korean war memorial museum when I entered I felt the best parts of the museum were the ancient war artifacts on display the replica turtle ship on the lower floor and the collection of modern aircraftships positioned outside The goodit was free for foreigners to enter It is an impressive building and is very clean and well maintained The gift shop was reasonably priced and had souvenirs I havent found anywhere else in Korea Nice gifts for vets especially The not greatIn the summer heat it was incredibly hot in this museum I dont think they had ac on or if they did it was not effective in such a large place Also the day we went there was a large protest going on directly in front of the entrance We werent threatened or harrased but it made touring the outside displays unpleasant Im told this is a common place to protest,Negative,-0.5038,Negative

3110,3.0,This is far from the 1 place in Seoul that some people say visit the National Museum of Korea well before this in other words I was in Seoul for two weeks and only got there on my last day and edited the time down to one hour The encyclopaedic coverage on level 3 of every conflict that the ROK has been involved in means it was rather militaristic from my point of view  explains why so many armed forces personnel were on visits there I guess Level 2 which deals with the Korean war is obviously the most important as earlier Korean military history receives similar but not as detailed coverage in other Korean museums Given the 60 year stand off with the North and the virtual on alert status since then of the armed forces you can begin to understand how ingrained in the Korean mind potentialif not perhaps imminent conflict is,Negative,-0.2854,Negative

3113,5.0,Probably the 1 place I visited while in Seoul even better than the DMZ and all of the shopping we did The first thing you see when you step onto their grounds is all of the amazing grandiose war statues and fighter planes that are bigger than life Before we even got into the museum we were treated to an unexpected show of one of the special army groups practicing their formation routine  The museum is just so interesting and educational and our time there really flew by We spent about 23 hours there which is about right unless you are a huge history buff  Highly recommend The free admission was just icing on top,Positive,0.9587,Positive
3114,4.0,The building is imposing along with dramatic bronze sculptures outside and acres of tanks planes ships and all the equipment of war I learned enough about the Korean conflict of the 1950s to appreciate its complexity along with now understanding the US role in how the country was divided to begin with following WWII You leave with a sense of the wars ongoing presence one section is dedicated to North Korean incursions into the South over the last 50 years This war is not yet over I was also struck with the LONG history of military conflict that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years War has shaped the Korean understanding and impacted its cultural expression for more than a thousand years We were there along with scores of school children on field trips and that moved us along a little faster than I would have liked An early morning visit would be advised Theres a nice snack bar to the right as you enter There was also a free locker to leave coats or extra items you dont want to carry through the building,Positive,-0.8527,Negative

3117,5.0,The sculpture park in the museum grounds is fascinating and the exhibits are very moving There is a large display of American and Korean aircraft tanks and missiles and a Korean Naval vessel too Inside the museum the displays are very informative and everything is in both Korean and English Other languages are represented by information leaflets and guides The exhibits are a mixture of historical artifacts wax model displays and video documentaries The museum can be a little disorientating at times and the actual War Memorial section is on the upper floor as you enter with other floors representing other time periods in Korean history In the central atrium area there is a large boat which was rather fun I thought It was a very educational day afternoon,Positive,0.4404,Positive
3118,3.0,The Korean War Memorial museum was an expansive and welldone grounds with 4D experience of Incheon landing I think this war needs to be remembered and would have appreciated a little more about real peoples experience It is heavily military but as a military history experience is it good I was there on a day with many elderly Koreans  and some of the men were looking at the large equipment going over every detail laughing while shaking their heads in reminiscence of what they had survived And many did not survive this horrible period of Korean history I wanted more of their story  not just weaponry,Negative,0.5788,Positive
3119,3.0,Touching visitas you walk through the corridors one can feel the massive sacrifices of men and women from all sides Once again war is ravaging and meaningless The countless battles and the final stalemate at the 38th parallel  is still plain for all to see today The exhibits are well presented  but the massive size of the hall makes the exhibits seem sparse and unconnected Perhaps I could not read Koreanand the English notices were few and did not delve deep enough to give a foreign visitor a deeper appreciation of the stories left untold One hour and I was outunlike the Imperial War Museum in London or the museums in the USA,Negative,-0.6757,Negative

3122,5.0,We had a brilliant day at the War Memorial  one of the highlights of our visit to Seoul The aircraft and tanks out the front of the museum are fascinating although take a hat so make sure you allow time to walk through everything here Inside the museum is huge so give yourself a couple of hours to see everything The museum starts with the prehistoric history of Korea moving through the Shilla history and then has a large section on the Korean War which is done very well with replica villages to walk through various videos and footage from the time It then moves on the the UN and what is being done today Lockers are available on the right at the entrance to the museum The only disappointment was the cafe was very basic and only served coffee and cake where as we really wanted lunch meaning that we had to leave the museum earlier than we would have liked in search of food,Positive,0.7159,Positive

3133,5.0,I just visited this museum again and am increasing my rating of it Last time I stated that I was disappointed because it did not have more information about the Korean War However after visiting again yesterday I just realized that the wing with all of the Korean War history was closed for renovation on my first visit Yesterday I showed up with my family and a school girl saw us and offered to give us a free tour she is volunteering for community service hours She took us through the Korean War history wing first it just reopened in March Then I took my family through the rest of the museum This place is really great; some of the best things are outside where they have actual tanks artillery aircraft and even a boat that the military has used over the years One more thing  it is free Even free parking Well worth seeing and a mustsee attraction in Seoul,Positive,0.8655,Positive

3136,5.0,WE were advised by a friend to visit this museum and did so on our first day in Seoul This was really impressive I am a bit of a history enthusiast so for me it was a given but even my wife was hugely impressed I had read up on Korean history and the Korean War but she had not and it was a crash course for her Partly indoors partly outdoors exhibits of tanks rocket launchers bombers and jets  even a patroltorpedo boat But exhibits inside were the best The exhibits took one through the Koean War with great displays and films selectable in Korean English Japanese or Chinese And the basement was dedicate to exhibits maps covering period 500 to about 1800AD THere were a lot of schoolchildren around and it was impressive the respect they showed towards the exhibits the war period and those that died  You will need almost a day to give this justice,Positive,0.9047,Positive

3144,5.0,It was a busy day when I visited but I would still probably bet I was the only person in the museum that had also visited the North Korean equivalent  The Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum in Pyongyang  It was interesting comparing the two and of course the Seoul version provides a much more rounded and historially accurate account However its possible to see propaganda from the South too  eg there are war crimes by the North documented here but the terrible atrocities committed by the South at the time are absent  Outside there are some large sculptures and quite an extensive display of military hardware from both sides as well as two of the massive loudspeaker systems used at the DMZ for psychological warfare until the operation was halted in 2004,Positive,-0.9231,Negative
3145,5.0,This museum was so descriptive and extensive in their information that you get to know every little detail about it everything you wanted to know was available in English Also it was not biased towards the Koreans it was simply the best Museum and im not a big fan of Museums i would truly recommend this to anyone going to korea,Positive,0.8574,Positive

3152,5.0,For a tourist coming from the Philippines we were in awe and amazed with the vast war memorabilia and the great display of military equipment since our own military has yet to implement their modernization program Head statues of the war heroes were displayed at the center of the building We took a photo of the rockets displayed outside since we dont have one here in our country A war ship is also on display with varied sizes of bullet dents from the enemy A big statue of brothers is at the side entrance and i think its touching to depict two brothers from two Koreas North and South meeting in a battlefield and expressing reconciliation love and forgiveness,Positive,-0.2263,Negative

3155,5.0,I was really impressed with the quality of this museum The admission was free which is always nice Most of the museum focuses on the Korean War but there are also other sections explains Koreas involvement in other wars such at the Vietnam War and the Persian Gulf War The Korean War is especially interesting to learn about because it involved so many different countries who allied with South Korea The Korean War actually holds the Guinness Record for having the most allies in a single war 67 allies If you like learning about recent wars this is a definite place to visit,Positive,-0.9832,Negative
3156,4.0,The Korean War sections are a little jingoistic at times but that is to be expected given the current geography and lasting memories of those terrible times 60 years ago Most of the displays are multilingual and some nice effort has gone into the AV presentations Theres more than enough millitary hardware around to keep the average 12 yr od boy or 42 yrold man in my case happy for hours and the outdoor memorials are both impressive and poignant and worth spending time viewing so wrap up warm on a cold day as its a bit exposed out there,Positive,0.9051,Positive

3171,4.0,I am not a history or military buff but I have visited this museum several times and always enjoy it Korean history is very long and filled with fascinating wars and military actions This museum gives a wonderful overview of it all Most of the signs are in English and there are English docents nearby to help you find your way around It is very easy to navigate through the War Museum and it never feels crowded It is vast so start early if you want to try to see it all There is usually a revolving exhibit space that shows new exhibits that are not military based if you need a break from the wars However you must pay a nominal fee for these In addition there are all manner of military machines outside for viewing Dont miss the gift shop it has some very unique and fairly priced items Several are open to exploration and the kids love that This museum is very easy to get to using the 4 or 6 subway line at Samgakji Station or the 110 bus You can walk to it from Iteawon as well,Positive,0.9652,Positive
3172,4.0,OK so I am partial to military museums because I was in the Air Force for 20 years But this one is pretty nice I was disappointed that they did not have more informaiton and history about the Korean War at least not in English but the amount of displays in the museum is really pretty good They have everything from bullets to aircraft  tanks a few boats etc Certainly worth doing Most of the museum is inside but there are some aircraft missiles and vehicles outside  so you can do this on either a nice day or a rainy day,Positive,0.9496,Positive
3173,4.0,A lot of the museum is great some is mediocre but there are plenty of different aspects of the Memorial that make it very much worth a visit As an American there is a deeper emotional attachment to the displays and information from the Korean War,Positive,0.3955,Positive

3185,5.0,This museum tells the story of Korea from the perspective of wars and invasions Given how many there have been in Korean history thats pretty much all of it The parts about ancient Korean history and the warring kingdoms of mediaeval times gets a bit wearing for the foreigner; but the two top floors which are devoted to the Korean War are mustsees as are the aircraft guns and tanks on display outside the museum  As this is also the site of the Korean War Memorial the complex takes its name from that statue which is also a necessary part of any visit Allow at least a couple of hours,Positive,-0.775,Negative
3186,5.0,I recommend stopping by this place for at least an hour or two There is a quiet somberness that is reflected just like certain monuments in Washington DC There is a lot to look at while walking both inside and out  There is a big display of static aircraft and artillery with English translations as well Lots of statues and a large quiet hall with the names of lost Korean soldiers engraved on pillars While you are in Korea I really recommend taking a moment to reflect and learn more about what happened there especially since this is the most defining moment of modern Korean history,Positive,0.7783,Positive

3189,5.0,This place explains so much of Koreas past both old and recent and helps any firsttimer get a good understanding of why Korea is the way it is Even if military history isnt your bag it is worth turning up in the morning to see the guardchanging display with twirling rifles and coordinated marching But the explanation of the Korean War the very sombre plaques listing all of the dead and the mindboggling display of military hardware outside really make it a great place to spend half a day on your sightseeing agenda,Positive,-0.4686,Negative
