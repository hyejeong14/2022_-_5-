By exit 4 turn left then right and you would see the entrance gate to this park. It was an accident that we didn't know the hotel we booked (Oriens - separate review) is nearby. Just 10 mins walk and whola were at the entrance. It is free for public and before the park there are many cafes', food carts and restaurants around it. Built in 1998 on the north side of Namsan Tower, the village has 5 restored Korean houses, gardens, pavilion, small streams, activity center, museum and small popup stores. Hanok means restored and its location is the original site for Jeonghakdong, a summer resort during the Joseon dynasty. The exhibit hall displays their traditional kitchen, clay pots, utensils, tea rooms, etc... There are toilets and this place is accessible by PWD. If you walk further south there is a hiking trail leading to N Seoul Tower and shuttle bus that can take you there directly. Parking is also available. When we visited there was a playground and activities set for the families and their kids. It was indeed a delightful surprise and experience for us to visit this park just right beside our hotel - one of the most scenic, romantic and beautiful attraction in Seoul.

273,3.0,"My visit here occurred on my third time in Seoul and I did not regret missing it on my first two trips. Unlike other recreated villages I have gone to worldwide, this one offers only five traditional houses, which have been moved here. They provide a good cross-section of how Joseon Dynasty citizens lived, but none beckoned to linger; and no hands-on activities, such as wearing traditional garments, were available on an early weekday afternoon in November.  Though there is no admission charge, the free access did not seem to stimulate interest, at least at this time of year. I saw only a handful of other visitors during my brief exploration. But this atmosphere proved to be a nice change from the crowds at popular tourist attractions, such as palaces. I enjoyed sitting by the pond here for a while and walking along one of the trails in the park at the rear of the complex.  The village is near the Myeongdong area of Seoul.

First you can experience 1 hour sleeping time in the hanok (for a small fee). I thought that's a very refreshing experience in true sense of the word. Next you can rent traditional costume and take photos or pretend you're in a period drama and walk around the village.

Fun games for the children to take part in as you walk, including a stamp collecting map for the children to find stamps as they walk around. Lovely village and So clean and well taken care of.

We came across the entrance to this traditional Village and park, and ended up spending more than an hour wandering around the traditional buildings, and the large park at the rear.  We were not able to get into many buildings, and the one building complex that looked interesting happened to be conducting a wedding reception on the day of our visit, which meant we were not permitted to enter anyway. On the day of our visit there were some temporary food stalls operating, and I got the impression from some signage that this park and the architected surrounds/seating etc. at the northern end that the Seoul Food Festival was to be held on this site.

But there are plenty of signs explaining what you're seeing so you don't have to be well-versed in any history beforehand (although it definitely makes the experience better).  We arrived towards the end of the day when everything was being packed up. I imagine it's more lively in the late morning/early afternoon when activities take place, stalls are open outside the main gate, and people walk around in traditional dress. But if you've been slowly walking the area like us, I'd still suggest to drop by. It's a very lovely area with a nice park just next door that makes for a nice stroll. There is also a gift shop which, surprisingly, has some nice and affordable souvenirs.  I am not sure if this is an attraction I would've gone out of my way to reach - which we definitely had. But if you have the time, and if you're interested in seeing what Korea looked like before, then do find a nice day and go.",Positive,0.9949,Positive

Beside the pond there are batches of small strawberries growing in the flower beds, and we notice some herbs here and there too.. When you walk around you will see pine cones which the shape is something Ive never seen , some kind of berries (which i wasn't sure can be eaten or not) and just the flowers are beautiful. Take Ur time and breath in the fresh air and somehow the place exudes calmness.  I like that there will be a corner for anyone to try some local traditional games. The only setback is would be awesome if there was someone to explain the game to us or maybe they should put some multi-language boards on instructions of games . Lolz..

Other than some of the old and traditional houses and buildings (but no one is living here), what this place offered was a massive garden that is so serene and tranquil. Upon entering and after a short walk, you will see a lovely pond with lots of fishes (i.e. Koi) swimming and birds flying around in a greenery and nature environment. Walking further, you will come by a section where fruit trees and vegetables are grown.  Walking further in, there is an open field where the operator placed traditional Korean games here and visitors could grab one up and play, to enjoy the past time activity.  What is interesting is the place where the Time Capsule that was buried here in 1994 to mark Seoul’s 600 Year Anniversary and is scheduled to be reopened in 2394!!! On top of it was the inscribed well wishes by well known political leaders and celebrities around the world.  There is also a section where the theatre and tea house is located (next to each other). Unfortunately we didn't make it on time for the performance but did dropby for some tea. It was good!  It was a good visit here despite the fact that the weather was sunny and warm. Do if you plan to come here, do remember to bring along an umbrella, hat and drinking water. Also recommended to put on a pair of comfortable or sport shoes as there are lots of walking to be done to be able to enjoy the scenic view of the nature!  The washrooms/souvenir shop are located near the main entrance on the right. In fact, right here, the national flower of Korea, the Rose of Sharon could be seen, very nice.

Ok, the snacks were that good but it was the experience I was buying. For a small fee, we also had the chance to put on traditional Korean clothing (quite a few selection to choose from) and posed for pictures inside another building. I recommend going there early so there are fewer people. We get to experience the above activities on our own without other people in the way. Just after we finish with our traditional clothing, a few groups of people were already there waiting and ""fighting"" over their preferred clothes. Another activity I wanted to try was the brush calligraphy session but for some reasons, it wasn't available until a couple of days later. I didn't realise there are seasons to calligraphy writing...

525,3.0,"The buildings are genuine but the ""village"" is an artifice. Essentially, it is a collection of 5 wealthy families’ homes relocated to this spot and landscaped to appear to represent a natural setting.  “Homes” is really a misnomer; these are the equivalent of today’s mansions. Though not overly picturesque or photogenic, they are, when examined patiently, a good glimpse into household life during that period (including how they used fire pits under the various living quarters as radiant heat).  Try to get here as soon as the place opens. As the day progresses, it will inevitably become completely over-run by busload after busload after busload of Chinese tourists. At no other sight will you see such a concentrated number of tourists from China. I don’t know why but this place is apparently a very popular, “must see” sight with all the tour groups. It amounts to a large number of people occupying a relatively small parcel of land. At times you will find yourself very distracted. It’s quite strange because there are no busloads of anyone from any other country.  This is far from a “must see” sight. I would save this as filler at the end of your stay in Seoul; don’t risk sacrificing any prime sight or sights on your list to go here.  On Wednesdays and Saturdays there are Taekwondo exhibitions by children and young teens, which adds to the touristy, carnival-like atmosphere. Keep in mind, the village is closed on Tuesdays; although you can walk the grounds, access to the homes is not possible.

There is also a Korean traditional medicine clinic within the park where you are invited for a cup of Korean tea and a free health check. In approximately 30 minutes or so young ladies/men, dressed in traditional and colourful costume, will take some information about your physical health, take some readings (with the help of modern aids) and take you to the traditional doctor for a quick review. The doctor will explain what is best for your health and leave you, if required, with a small dose of traditional medicine for the next two days. Everything is free and there is no hidden agenda.

The funniest that happened was when my son stepped into someone else's house. The most important thing you should bring for the visit is a good quality camera.

608,5.0,"You'd expect a village to be in the countryside, but not this one. The village isn't a ""natural"" village as the houses were moved there from elsewhere. Apparently the ""Han"" in Hanok refers to the Han people who are the Koreans (they are nothing to with the Chinese Han people). The ""ok"" of Hanok means house, so they are Korean houses. The houses are from the Joseon period and belonged to quite important people. One belonged to the parents of a Korean Queen. The houses are wooden and a little raised with a few steps up. Where there are wooden floors, this were the meeting parts of the houses. However where the families actually lived have covered stone floors which had heating underneath. Outside at ground level you can see holes in the side where the fires were lit, and around the corner you might find a large chimney. I wouldn't have wanted to clean those fires out; you'd need to be a horizontal chimney sweep. The doors can be lifted up out of the way in summer to let breezes through. At the Village there is also a meeting hall set very scenically with a little lake in front and hills behind. The hills must be granite as the rock outcrops look identical to the granite outcrops of Girraween National Park in Queensland, Australia. At the entrance to the Village are full-sized models of various dignitaries, in singles and pairs. There are holes where the faces should be and you can stand behind and stick your face up to the hole to look as though you are wearing traditional garb. The toilets are just a short way behind, should you need them. Newly married or about to be married couples have their photos taken there in traditional dress. A couple was there when we were and I asked the mother/mother-in-law if it would be possible to take their photo. She readily agreed and indicated I should be in the photo too, as did the couple, who moved apart for me to stand between them.

It was terrific! They spoke excellent English and explained plenty of information about Korea's traditions and culture. It was such a benefit for us to have experts guide us through the village and it benefited the students by having a chance to practice their English. I thought this was a brilliant idea for the school to offer this service. We were shocked to find out that we were the students' first tour ever at this village and the only tour they had that day! They had done such a great job; I thought they had given numerous tours before ours. If you go to the village check to see if they are giving complimentary tours. They are well worth it!

675,4.0,"This was one of the highlight of my trip. I am trying to be as unbiased here as possible because the visit didn't start out well.  The address that the hotel provided to the taxi driver was questionable. Although he used his GPS, we still ended up in the middle of nowhere where different people tell us different directions. If you are lost, it is best to ask the workers who owns the shop there, not working there cos most of times, they don't know where it is. One even leaded us to Namsan N Seoul Tower!! We even allocated 1 hour time frame just in case we were lost and we were still late by 15 mins.  You need a local to help you reserve this. Try as I could, I could not navigate myself through their website to help me make a reservation. Luckily my hanok @ KunDaeMunJip helped me with the reservation and paid for it.  We went on a Tuesday where the village was closed except for the tea ceremony. It was ok as we have earlier checked on Buckhon Hanok Village and the National Folk Museum at Gyeongbokgung.  When you first step in, you will be treated to a nice cup of tea and later they will lead you to a room where you can choose your hanok which you can wear throughout your tea ceremony. It helps to come early so you can get the best choice. As we were late, I was very unhappy with my choice of hanbok.  Then they will lead you outside and help you take photographs. Tip : Take it against the backdrop of the Namsan Seoul Tower behind you. They will also give you a complimentary picture after the event.  Then they will bring you to a room where they will explain how to seat, how to serve, how to appreciate the tea. I love this part! You will also be served with some really really delicious rice cakes to enjoy with your tea when the music performances are held.  To me, this was better than kimchi making because this helped me learn how to appreciate the Korean culture and the tea ceremony as well as the music.

MiSuDa allows you to wear Korean dress, learn some Korean words and manners, experience a tea ceremony and listen to live traditional music. I don't know where you can get all that in one place, so it was definitely a great idea to go. Some tips:  1. You can't get tickets anywhere except through a Korean language website and on-site. It's not easy to walk in if you need an interpreter; we were just lucky that an American reserved beforehand so there was an English interpreter that day. We couldn't get tickets online or at Sejong Center, after four months of trying. They let us in because they felt sorry for us!  2. It starts at 4 PM and ends at 6 PM (not 8 PM). I saw in a website that the activities included rice cake making -- we didn't do that.  3. The teacher and the interpreters were so pleasant! They really made the experience memorable and fun.  4. No need to bring anything but money and a camera. They provide the costumes and all the ingredients for the tea ceremony. Actually, even if you don't have your own camera, they will give you a hard copy of your picture in costume.  5. No parking in the area -- take public transport to get there.  6. If you want something to eat or drink, you can get food and drinks at the convenience store outside the gate. Didn't see a restaurant or food stall inside the park.  As for the Hanok Village -- it's free and fun. I didn't try them, but there are pay activities there, too (playing drums, crafts and the like).

692,5.0,"Intro:  If you get off at Chungmuro Subway Station, you are right in front of Namsangol Hanok Village (traditional Korean village). You may consider it interesting to find this area standing between the tall buildings. This village has five restored traditional Korean houses and a pavilion, a pond and a time capsule, which make it a perfect spot to take a walk.  When you enter the front gate, you will see the vast valley and the Chunugak building to the left of the pond. Along with the pond, it is a splendid place where performances are held. On the side you will see five traditional houses. These houses were rebuilt after the traditional houses of Joseon Dynasty and belong to those of various social classes, ranking from peasants to the king. The furniture in the house is situated to help guests understand the daily life of the past, and the clean, traditional houses and their antique items provide a great photo op. If you would like to check out some souvenirs, stop by the traditional craftwork exhibit where you can buy small dishes and other items. You can also have traditional tea and refreshments. On the grounds, there are traditional games you may try such as 'neolttwigi' (sea-saw jumping), 'tuho'(arrow throwing) and 'yunnori' (traditional game of throwing wooden yut sticks). Don't forget to go see the traditional marriage ceremony! During the weekends, traditional marriages are shown at Bak Yeong Hyo's Residence. The traditional marriage ceremony is an interesting event for both Koreans and foreigners and many gather to watch. During the winter season (November to February), there are not as many wedding ceremonies as held in the spring and fall. Weddings are typically held around noon or 1 p.m. and visitors can take pictures with the husband and wife wearing traditional wedding costumes.

693,3.0,"The village is right smack in the city centre; about 20 minutes walk from the Myeong-Dong train station and best of all, admission is free. It provides an insight into the traditional Korean lifestyle and how people used to live, eat, dress and work. You can also rent the traditional hanbok (female costume) at a price of KRW10,000 = USD 10 per session.  It was the school holidays when we were there and there were many excursions organised by schools for their students. It was heart warming to see the cute little ones learning calligraphy, how to greet, bow, etc.  A nice place to visit for a photo session with the traditional buildings as background. Be sure to look out for Namsan Tower. Other than that, there is nothing much to this village really.",Negative,0.9643,Positive
694,4.0,"It was the eve of Lunar New Year and we found the village by chance after seeing so many people walking towards it's direction. Street vendors lined the street outside the village. Inside, a huge concert like stage was set up. The lakes, ponds and streams were frozen white as it was winter. There was a cultural fair. Nevertheless, visitors were also paying attention to the well preserved architecture of the hanoks. On a normal day, I would imagine a very serene village with it's winding paths into a huge garden overlooking the NSeoul Tower.",Positive,0.9299,Positive
695,5.0,"Admission to the Hanok Village is free. Enjoy the houses that have been preserved for us and future generations. If you are interested in housing architecture, this attraction is a must see.  Take some time to stroll around the park, up to the Time Capsule Square. We took the clockwise route and enjoyed the pathside stream on the way back down.",Positive,0.9432,Positive
696,5.0,"If you're visiting Namsan Seoul Tower, it's nice to pair that with a visit to the Hanok Village (a little Korean folk village and park). There's a small bus from the Tower that stops in front of Hanok Village--ask a worker at the Tower. You can take a leisurely stroll through this place, learn some history, try out the historical artifacts for yourself, sit by the large pond, and also check out the huge, interesting granite time capsule up the hill. If you go on a clear summer night when there aren't many people, you can lie on the capsule underneath the stars for a nice experience.",Positive,0.891,Positive
697,4.0,"Beautifully maintained. Relaxing stroll. Not touristy - no souvenir vendors! We missed the daily english tour, but Mr Kim(?) took us around for an hour, because that's all the time we had. He told us about the history, the architecture, the culture. there is no charge, it's close to the subway and on the way to N Seoul Tower in Namsam park. Definitely worth the time.",Positive,0.8961,Positive
