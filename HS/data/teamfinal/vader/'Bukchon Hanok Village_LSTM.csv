160,5.0,"What a Lovely Neighborhood indeed. Very calmed place filled with little streets in between and tiny dead end streets. It can get annoying for a bit trying to go on each and everyone of these tinny streets, but soon enough you'll find out, that is not about getting somewhere, but the beauty that you can photograph at the end of each of these streets. Then you turn around and go on your way to the next. Kinda like this is a journey and not a destination; if I want to get all philosophical and stuff.  Therefore after you are done with the cute pictures, remain in the main street of this village and then start to build your way up. You'll find on your left and right side a multitude of nice little shops; we specially loved a tinny flower shop / coffee shop. Very subtle and calm inside, nice jazz music as a background and although South Koreans have the worst coffee to drink in the world; the small pastries kinda make up for this.  All in all and without too much mystery, it is worth to go and check one by one these little stores, where you will find also a very nice lady who makes and designs her own clothing (very luxurious and not cheap) but very much worth. Also there is a fine lady who designs her own silver jewelry, very well made and with a nice weight and surprisingly very affordable.  Please look at our pictures and find out what we are talking about. Beautiful street indeed and we had a lovely time. This is the kind of streets you need to look for in Seoul. The crowded Millennial streets will drive you nuts with cheap nasty food and cheap Chinese stuff that has no material and spiritual value whatsoever.",Positive,0.9938,Positive

Despite being crowded, this is such a wonderful area to explore, albeit quite hilly but scenic and definitely great photo ops.

The neighborhood has a charm all its own that is unique to Seoul. It’s a nice walk that can take all day, depending on how quickly one progresses through the picturesque streets. The main arteries have hanoks that have been converted for commercial uses so aside from the architectural wonders, there is a lot of retail shopping to be done while taking breaks in between for great meals and coffee breaks.

Bukchon is a hillside village (almost) of traditional hanok (Korean house) with lots of wood, attention to detail and character. It makes for a lovely contrast between the old and new with views across the rooftops towards modern Seoul.  It's definitely worth a mooch around, but be aware that there are very steep slopes and steps so it's not ideal for those with mobility issues or indeed those who are unfit.  Bukchon is a short walk from Cheongyecheon/ Myeongdong.",Positive,-0.0154,Neutral

And also it’s not big. Like 3 blocks. One has to be super quiet while walking up those streets; there are signs everywhere mentioning that. It is also very crowded with tourists; people who are having an entire photoshoot in the middle of the street. The Bukchon observatory is underwhelming: just a tall house towering over the others. One last thing: if you are tired of walking already or are having back/hip issues (like i did today), you will find this climb up those streets challenging.

Now- these are also people's home and the many signs posted on the walls remind you this, and to be quiet. And even though no one said anything to me it reay felt voyueristic and sorta intrusive.

I tried to imagine how I'd feel like if day in, day out, I had to contend with throngs of tourists taking pictures outside my house.

Bukchon Hanok Village is a residential area of about 3-4 blocks square where the buildings were constructed in the era and style of yesteryear... perhaps 150 years ago. Hence, old bamboo and plaster construction. Great for architects and history buffs, boring for everyone else. Sure, some great photo ops of the city skyline and any number of people wearing the traditional Korean dress (Hanbok) but essentially, you are one of thousands wandering through someone else's home and neighbourhood.

267,5.0,"Bukchon Hanok Village, in a Northern hilly area of Seoul, is my favorite neighborhood in the city because of its distinctive traditional architecture, known as hanok. Boasting several hundred of these homes, it has the largest number that still remain in the metropolis. On my most recent visit to Seoul, I took a friend here to introduce her to this earlier-era style that relies on natural materials. The one-story, tile-roof houses with patterned walls, first designed and built in the 14th century, feature an interlocking framework of uwooden beams that rest on blocks of stone. Other elements often used include earth, clay, straw and paper made from mulberry bark. The traditional courtyard garden remains hidden from the street.  We stopped first at Bukchon Tourist Information before the village for free maps and brochures. The man working there spoke excellent English and proved to be most helpful. But we did not go there directly. Instead, we stood looking confused about where to go at a crossroads and were approached by a mobile tourist information rep. Dressed in a red jacket and red hat, he was in the area to offer assistance to tourists, armed with English, Japanese and Chinese language skills. I have never witnessed this service in other cities worldwide. These reps can be seen throughout popular tourist destinations in Seoul and have steered me in the right direction more than once.  As we ascended the hill, the hanoks suddenly appeared and the modern city had been left behind. Many of the houses have been turned into tea houses, restaurants and workshops, but there are still private residences galore. Two women in yellow hats and yellow vests with “Please be Quiet” in English, Japanese and Chinese emblazoned on the front and back walked along the narrow alleys, often putting an index finger to closed lips. I also noted a poster on one wall, requesting visitors to be quiet. It appears that the residents would like less noise in their neighborhood.  We arrived here in midday and it was like tourist central. Despite efforts to keep noise down, many visitors could have cared less. One even noticed a gate ajar and rushed into the courtyard of a private home to take a photo. But there were plenty of photo ops along the alleys and at the top of the hill, where a stunning view of Seoul could be captured. We headed off to more quiet streets to simply soak in the atmosphere. In the past, I have gone here in early morning and the whole area was naturally quiet.  Bukchon Hanok Village can be reached by subway line 3, Anguk stop. Take exit 2 or 3 and follow the directional signs.",Positive,0.9719,Positive
268,4.0,"When we visit anywhere new, I always like to have some historical places to visit as well as seeing how local life is at present. Having seen lots of castles and shrines already, a traditional village, where people still live, sounded like an interesting place.  It really was beautiful, and in some places, the contrast with these ancient homes ith th buildings of modern Seoul in the distance showed how the city has changed. There were several girls walking about in traditional hanbok costumes, and that enhanced the feeling that this probably had looked the same hundreds of years ago. All of that, I liked. A lot.  But, if you head to Seoul, or anywhere in Asia in the summer, it's going to be hot. Because it's hot, it's not the peak tourist season, but that doesn't mean that tourists aren't out in force. Just like us, hundreds of others decided to come here mid-afternoon; it was very crowded. In order to get decent photos of the architecture, etc.. you have to be pretty creative in angling your shots, or at the very minimum, wait it out for enough people to walk by so you can get a picture.  I would guess that this is pretty typical no matter what time of year you're here, so if I were going to go back, I would head there first thing in the morning, when the residents are about the only people you'll see in the streets.",Positive,0.9709,Positive

They have these lifesaver type lollies that whistle when you blow or suck through them. Entertaining and well annoying, but fun. I also did a Korean knot tying experience. It is really for beginners and available on a walk in basis. You get to choose from two types of bracelets, a key chain and two types of necklaces. Most of it is done for you, it is just a matter of choosing colours, and tying the macrame type knots. No Korean is needed as most have basic English. It was fun, but too simple for me. You can book a class for the more intricate knot projects. Which I will do next time. Just on the side, you sit on the ground, so with my dicky knees this was a little challenging.

The best photo opportunity is at the top of the hill. It will be obvious where that is once you ascend the hill. At the top of the hill you’ll see handmade signs leading you to the “Bukchon Overlook”. This is not an official overlook but simply an older gentleman who charges admission to look out from his top floor about 6 stories up. He serves you a drink and there are some nice photo opportunities so it is worth the 3000 won IMO. He also has a cute parrot.

However, given the world's most populous nations have yet to travel to Seoul en mass, my best advice would be for those unhappy with the noise some tourists can bring to sell up now. Regardless, there are plenty of great photo opportunities for the curious traveller, as well as some shopping opportunities and cafes hidden throughout.  A good access point is from Samcheon-Ro, which runs north-east from the eastern side of the Gyeongbokgung grounds. Follow the sidewalk maps and signs until you find a narrow, steep staircase disappearing between the cafes and houses (Google maps: 37.584644, 126.982128 .) Climbing the staircase you'll soon reach a street overlooking Samcheon-Ro below, with views back to Gyeongbokgung.

We slept on futon mattresses. Quite comfortable. The place was comfortable with air con in each bed room plus the basement. The home was in traditional renovations of main wood and wooden floor.

The feel and experience is really authentic and we are happy with the choice of having this accommodation in our first of 3 segments to soak in the korean culture and history.  From this home we can walk to gyeonbakkung palace which is anotger historical sight within the city. There is also the subway station. Around the whole village, there are many little shops offering a wide range of shopping and food beverage options.  The only downside i believe is walking back to the home after a full day outing!

Also at the end of the day, it's no big deal. It's quirky and quaint but the hanok buildings can be seen in other areas outside of Seoul. So if you are going to be going off the beaten track in S Korea it's not really worth visiting Bukchon. Its location between the 2 most popular palaces in Seoul make it an inevitable stop though.

741,4.0,"The two best pieces of advice in visiting Bukchon are: Ignore many of the “recommended walk routes” you find, particularly in guide books. They would be better called “If you walk in and around this general perimeter we’ve laid out, you’ll see Bukchon”. Go to the “Images” option of most search engines and type in “Bukchon”, you’ll find alternative, much more detailed (and perhaps better) walking route maps.  Get an early start (getting to Bukchon by 8:00 – 8:30 A.M. is recommended). The area is surprisingly small and the streets very narrow. By 10:00, it’ll start to fill up with mini tour groups and other tourists with cameras to the point that any pictures you take will be mostly of other people taking pictures. This is especially true for the north-west section of Bukchon. [If it’s just you and the occasional resident walking their dog or walking to school, you’ll know you’re there at the right time]. If you’re staying close by, it might be a good idea to visit it until crowds start to show up, then leave and pick up where you left of the next day.

One of the Hanok has crafted creatures on their balcony, another have plants in traditional pots outside their house, very Zen & peaceful. There is a shop called Granhand, love his creations of different scents. It's of natural scents made from plant extracts of quality ingredient, very different feel from the branded eau de toilette over the counter. Amongst the Hanok one of them are opened to public for a minimal price of KRW15000 entrance fee comes with a nice herbal tea at the end of the tour of.

Only thing is the entire walk can be very tiring, especially the uphill areas. My two elderly companions didn't enjoy it as much because of all the walking.

784,5.0,"Let me just say that having lived in Seoul for two years, I developed a walking tour route for when people visited.

The general route was: Begin at City Hall, walk up through Gwanghwamun Square visiting the Cheonggyecheon Stream and a possible visit to Hangul Museum under statue, continue to Gyeongbukgung Palace. Time permitting walk up through Samcheongdong into the Bukchon Hanok Village, continue down to where the tour ends in Insadong. This is enough for just about a full day of touring and requires A LOT of walking.  One of the interesting things about Bukchon is that it is in a sense a 'living museum.' People still live here and these are still active houses. Looking down the narrow streets over the roof lines really gives you an idea of what Seoul might have looked like long ago.  Being one of the major tourism spots in Seoul, there are a lot of tourist trap type shops and cafes. But, all round this area are some really great traditional tea shops and even little art galleries tucked away. It's worth doing some exploring.

Lots of flowers blooming on early summer. The roads were quite narrow and scenic. Excellent for pictures. It was great cultural experience. If you don't care about culture, don't bother with it. You might find it Uninteresting.  I was very tired of walking towards the end of my journey there, so I rested in a Cafe And had some shaved ice cream with red bean paste and rice cake. The portion was big but still it was overpriced, in my opinion. Actually, everything in there is more pricey than anywhere else. It's a stylish little town.

The first time was great because it indeed was a weekday. I decided to return on my last day in Korea to capture a few more photos.

Several hundred single storey houses in a tight little area in a city where real estate prices are sky high and the pressure to develop is intense is a testament to a combination of good fortune and enlightened government. A stroll through Bukchon is delightful and there is always the opportunity to dive into a gallery or coffee shop if the slight climb to the top Is too much effort. It is no wonder that film crews are regularly found preparing their scenes for Seoul-based soaps.  I imagine many reviewers go on package tours. That is a mistake in Seoul - everything is so accessible and the delight is coming across little lanes almost by accident. So it is with Bukchon.

One of the hanog I saw sported a mass of barbed wire all over the garden wall, which was not exactly a pleasure to look at. Still, it is a precious piece of heritage as all the other historic architecture (the very small amount left of it) in Seoul are either religious or military/government buildings, not civilian ones, so this is both special and something ordinary people can more easilly relate to. It is possible to stay in a hanog bed and breakfast in Bukchon and this would be something I would definitely go for.

There we got to rent one hanbok each, and take pictures of ourselves in traditional Korean costumes and accessories. It was so much fun!  Had we planned our Bukchon visit better, we would’ve been able to do so much more that the place offered: participate in Korean handicraft making, learn to make kimchi, among other things. But it was a good walk anyway, like a blast from the past of Korea.  There were a lot of independent cafes and small stores that were really interesting.

It is also very crowded with tourists; people who are having an entire photoshoot in the middle of the street. The Bukchon observatory is underwhelming: just a tall house towering over the others.

Bukchon Hanok Village is a residential area of about 3-4 blocks square where the buildings were constructed in the era and style of yesteryear... perhaps 150 years ago. Hence, old bamboo and plaster construction. Great for architects and history buffs, boring for everyone else.

It is really for beginners and available on a walk in basis. You get to choose from two types of bracelets, a key chain and two types of necklaces. Most of it is done for you, it is just a matter of choosing colours, and tying the macrame type knots. No Korean is needed as most have basic English. It was fun, but too simple for me. You can book a class for the more intricate knot projects. Which I will do next time. Just on the side, you sit on the ground, so with my dicky knees this was a little challenging.

We slept on futon mattresses. Quite comfortable. The place was comfortable with air con in each bed room plus the basement. The home was in traditional renovations of main wood and wooden floor. The modern part was the bathroom toilet and kitchen. The feel and experience is really authentic and we are happy with the choice of having this accommodation in our first of 3 segments to soak in the korean culture and history.  From this home we can walk to gyeonbakkung palace which is anotger historical sight within the city. There is also the subway station.

1337,3.0,"While we visited the Gyeongbokgung Palace, we realized it was only a short walk to the Bukchon Hanok Village so we thought it would be a good opportunity to look at the traditional houses.  First off, even in the middle of winter it was very crowded. Since the area is essentially just a neighborhood of new and old houses which keep the look and style of old Korean dwellings, to walk around is free. This attracts a lot of people as expected. What I personally found is that you don’t truly see much while you are there. Because you walk in and around streets and alleys you only really see roofs, walls and doors. Don’t get me wrong it was interesting but not what I expected. It is also more visually stunning than what pictures will ever be able to capture, so in my opinion take a few photos but don’t be worried about photographing a ton of structures.  You can go in a few places that are now shops, but we decided to forego that process since they were mostly tea houses and I’m not a big tea drinker. Also the touristy shops on the main street are nothing to get excited about.  The one thing we did do is find some great food in the neighborhood. We ended up at a great noodle and dumping house where we partook in both delicacies.

It was really huge and he even have his own reading pavilion! the house were well kept but...we are not allowed to step in the house, so we just stroll around. But i like the environment tho! Along the narrow road you can find few souvenir shops, but its a bit pricey as it was unique and not like those souvenirs we buy in bulks. Most of the items sold were those made in small quantities and they look very precious and artistic to me. I end up buying their Korean biscuit - unfortunately I forgot the name...

Do wear comfortable shoes though as there is alot of walking to do. You can also rent a hanbok for an hour or two to walk around the area. It's definitely worth a photo shoot.

Not sure if seeing students in their hanbok is common but it was truly a nice scene when they are around the area. Wear comfortable shoes and I think it is nicer if it will be done in the morning or during sunset. It has 2 different areas and you can easily get lost in the small alleys and small stairways but never fear because there are a lot of tourist around. You must schedule this on a day where you won't feel pressured walking around. The more you pay attention to the details of the houses the more it will be interesting.  Before you go, check what else you can do because I noticed that there are cooking classes or some sort of art classes around there too. Also, if the news shows that there are a lot of people on streets on rally/picketing around the King Sejong statue then avoid this area as no cabs will take you there or pick you up if it is late at night.  I also recommend that you stay around this area, its quite a good place to experience traditional houses and it is also close to the tourist hot spots.

Many tourists doing their own smartphones shooting too, they were laughing why the hassle where smartphone already sufficed for the photography.

Without the map it is pretty easy to get lost as all houses seem to look the same!

Actually number 5 and 6 are the same spot but one is from the upward view and the others is downward.  Bukchon is surrounded by souvenir shops, cloth shops, restaurants, tea houses and hanbok (traditional Korean dress) rental shops. In every minute I saw women in hanbok walking around and take selfies, that's cute.  Be quiet and respect the locals since this is a residential area. There are signs telling you not to disturb the locals.  Just a few hundred meters north of Bukchon, it's Samcheongdong-gil road where there are heaps of nice restaurants. And if you walk further, you can find Gyeongbokgung palace, Changdeokgung palace and Jongmyo shrine. So come in the early morning to complete this walking route.

People actually live in this part of town, and what makes it a ""hanok"" village is that all of their homes resemble the old ""hanok"" of Korea's past dynasties.  Unless you get a walking tour with a group, you won't have any commentary at all. But if you go here yourself, you can find a hanbok rental store and wear their traditional costume around the village for 1-2 hours! I think it's a great deal and is worth the Won because the experience of wearing their costume freely around an old-school style village is priceless.

There are the occasional shops and a few tearooms, but for the most part is consists of residental buildings.

At times it is quite a maze of narrow streets, some quite amazing, some a bit less interesting. If possible, pick up a road map from the tourist guides. They wander around this area.  Some parts have really stunning views, check some of my pics for that. It is also nice to see people wander around in traditional clothes (Hanbok)....even though mostly rented (free access to all palaces if dressed like that). The combination of the Hanoks and the old-school dressed pedestrians give this area a lovely charm.  Since people do live here, be a bit respectful. There are signs everywhere with a few ground rules. Even though many tourists completely ignore these, especially when it comes to the noise. Too bad.

The village or area itself is quiet and is a great place with quaint little shops selling souvenirs, clothes, Jewellery. They aren't tacky shops but are shops that sell affordable local brands. Most of the shops are located along two main roads but you won't find it as busy or crowded as Myeongdong which is another experience of its own.  So while most tourists spend an afternoon walking and looking and the old houses, this was actually a nice refuge and charming place to spend a a couple of days at.

The village mixes the old traditional houses with some newer style.

1945,4.0,"After visiting the Changdeokgung palace (please refer to my earlier review of this place as well) as part of our full day city tour, which is just a short drive away from here, our guide brought us here for a short walkabout to immerse in another different aspects of the Korean culture and lifestyle.  It was about 10.45am when we arrived and the weather warm and sunny. There is a small road with shophouses located on both sides of it (i.e. cafes, restaurants, retail and souvenir shops etc), and according to our guide, this place is very famous among the Japanese tourists, possibly because they are the ones who help to spur ""tourism"" activity here and true enough, in our walk around here, we saw many groups of Japanese tourists.  As we walked deeper into the small road and into the lane where houses are located (of which some have been converted to retail and business operations). The walk was uphill on stone and rocky pathways. The houses here were very nice and lovely that depicted their long past history (of course some have been reconstructed or rebuilt and one do need to pay to admit).  Most of the houses were well maintained and one could easily experience the Korean's enriching culture and history.  As we walked higher (actually the walking trail was a full circle walk uphill and downhill and back to where we started), we saw more houses, unique shop houses, hostels and they were very beautifully decorated with flowers. When we reached the highest point, we did have a good bird eye's view on the vicinity and could even see the palaces from here, besides the mountains!  It's a worthwhile visit here definitely as one could immerse in the unique ambience of the lovely Hanok Village of the past in present time. Although the walk can be challenging for some (at certain section, it was quite steep), just take your own sweet time and pace and you will still be able to complete the walk and see lovely things. If my 80-year old mum can do so, everyone can too!  However, do take note of the following to make your walking trail fun and enjoyable:  Do wear pair of comfortable/short shoes here and there will be lots of walking (especially walking uphill); Bring along drinking water, umbrella and hats during summer time; and Do keep the volume of talking low as there are still many residents staying here to avoid disturbing them.

If you have trouble getting around, this is NOT your place. If it is raining or crazy hot it would be better to do this another day.

You will find signs everywhere reading ""Please be quiet"" or ""Please don't stand on the stairs"".

The walk around the village for tourists is not that long. In fact, I would estimate about a 15 -20 minute walk in total. We came during the evening which was a bit crowded but it was tolerable.

2022,5.0,"Bukchon is my favorite neighborhood. It's my favorite because of the preservation of historic homes and building styles typical throughout Seoul before the redevelopment. In one particular area, there are many of these homes that are living artist studios where you can visit (often for a $1 cost), and for an additional cost you can make art or a craft with them. We have done a few of these, and have done with just adults and with kids, and everyone not only had a great time, but also made a functional piece of art for use or display. Our party made painted necklaces for $10, painted hair decoration for $10, did a woodblock print ($3), and learned how to tie buttons from cord (free). If you have time, we highly suggest a visit to a studio or art center, there are mostly just drop in, so you can find one that interests you.  Another popular stop is a teahouse. There are many, and most walking tours pass by at least one. Teahouses usually involve a cup of tea and a sweet, but cost more than many travelers think it should, but the experience is worth it for many.  It is easy to enjoy a walking tour through the neighborhood, there are tours outlined in many different guidebooks or websites. We started at one corner down on the street that goes the palaces, and walked up and through the neighborhood, and then back down to the other side, and ended by the big palace and walking past the folk museum. Just make sure your walking tour gets you ""up"" enough where you can wander through the neighborhoods of hanok, the traditional homes.

They might look easy but you will be surprised it can be so tedious!  My niece dropped her iPhone and the screen cracked.

I found some streets to be quite lovely and peaceful; some others I hit right as tour buses were unloading and that was not so great. They have people stationed on some of the corners asking tourists to be quiet, since it is a residential neighborhood, but the tour groups I was near ignored that and were very loud and rude. So, try to time it to arrive early before those buses. Some of the surrounding streets have some nice cafes and coffee shops. You can also find a bunch of places offering workshops in various crafts like woodworking, kite making, and knot tying. If I had an extra day I would have made time to do one of those.

But if you can take the 15-minute leisure walk to Bukchon, do so by all means. Good exercise and it helps increase your feel of the area. Then explore the place with the quaint houses and unique shops, eating really good ice cream and streetfood along the way, and just enjoying the quiet and lovely scenes around the village.

Well, the first demolition happened a decade ago in terms of construction, then the second demolition in its personality is on the way. I would say even for that short 3 years of my staying there, I've witnessed more than 50% of my favorite stores including small handmade shops, real cafés, local restaurants had been replaced by worldwide or local super power franchises. This was really frustrating and became a reason to leave the town... I still give 4 stars though because there are yet some survivors struggling against the push of landlords and also there are beautiful narrow hidden alleys all around the corners.

We traversed the road leading up a hill and found concrete stairs leading down only to find out that we're back to where we came from. We climbed up again and took our chance at a corner leading to the observatory until we came to a narrow street that was lined with the traditional houses and there were several streets like this. We just followed the path where our eyes took us and reached another street that led us to Insadong.

Stop for a meal in the old Hanok shop or coffee in a modern setting, admire some of the local creative and artistic wares.

There are hire shops that cater for this (but I gather they don't hire shoes - they were all wearing Nikes and the like!). Apparently, they can get into the various Palaces for free if they are in costume. Most are delighted to have their photos taken by or with foreign tourists - I don't mean cynically, but they want to be noticed - that's the whole point of dressing up.

Every turn and angle leads to another path of beautiful shophouses. A very interesting place and I can say it's one of my favourite districts to just wander around, take photos and get lost in the many similar looking alleys. Even the bare trees in winter that lined the streets looked pretty! A pity we were rushing if not we could have explored the place more. There are 9 photo zones, but I didn't have time to visit them. I would gladly visit samcheongdong/ bukchon hanok village again during my next trip and take lots of photos of the beautiful hanoks! It is walkable from gyeongbokgung, changdeokgung and insadong!

Be ready to climb some steep stairs to get there, though. The 'village' is perched on hillsides and as you walk around, you get wonderful views of the village and the modern city off in the distance.

2257,5.0,"I spent a week in Bukchon and while I did not get to visit all the main sites and attractions of Seoul I think living in Bukchon gave me a real sense of what it's like to live and work in modern Korea. Bukchon remains very traditional in the sense that several hundred traditional houses ( Hanok) and workshops remain so you can spend time wandering through the narrow lanes and a number of buildings offer workshop experiences such as kite making, ceramics, traditional dress ( hanbok) experiences to enhance the cultural experience. In addition I noticed a lot of Korean tourists were staying in houses converted into homestay or guest houses. The area also has strong connections with modern Korea as the streets are filled everyday when workers pour out of the Hyundai office blocks to buy coffee in the many coffee shops ( yes - these do include Starbucks!). Lots of food outlets too offering lots of variety. Sadly a few streets are overrun by tourists ( mainly Chinese) and this can limit the pleasure but there are plenty of times and streets when the coach tours are not there to spoil the sense of being in a living and lively local community.

Here you can walk paved streets, lined with Hanoks, many of which remain residential while others serve as cafes, coffee shops, shops, galleries and a handful of small museums. Seems there are some homestay opportunities in the area as well if visitors fancy staying in a Hanok during their time in Seoul.  We found Bukchon to be a good place to stroll and enjoyed seeing the many traditional Korean style buildings. It felt over-marketed and promoted but still a nice place to spend time, especially if you intend to be in the area, visiting the UNESCO World Heritage Chengdeokgung Palace.

It was a constant mind boggling decision as to which direction to take to fully appreciate our visit.  We had no one to tell us where to go and what to do. We just made a quick stop at the tourist information office where we got a map of the village and off we went. Looking back, that was certainly not a great idea. But we were clueless as to the availability of a guide anyway, so we didn't have much of a choice.  The traditional looking houses in the village appeared to have local residents living inside. So practically, this was a peek of the actual traditional Korean village. It was quite an interesting experience, but we got too exhausted to a point that regret surfaced at the end of our walking tour.

It gives you a feel though of what the area was originally like, with tight lanes and small building with strong doors. If you climb up the hills follow the signs to the observatory where you can climb the stairs in a building to the top where you get a view looking down on the area.

But that's the problem -- they're largely just in hanoak style, not actually vintage or historic buildings. In fact, knocking down an old hanoak to replace it with a new building in hanoak style is a common practice. That said, Bukchon is one of the last places in Seoul, maybe the last place, to see a traditional roofscape uninterrupted by multistory modern buildings.

The area is still inhabited by locals, so you are advised to keep your speaking voice relatively low and quiet when walking around the area, and especially as the day draws to a close, even if you do desire to see the sunset and distant parts of Seoul from an elevation around this Bukchon hanok area, do take care not to scream, shout or talk loudly.

The local guide with us told us that koreans dont go to this shop - it catered to tourists and an ""authentic shop"" for koreans were situated just 3 streets away. however, to this tourist's taste, this experience was good enough.

2399,5.0,Bukchon is a small traditional area located an easy subway trip from central Seoul. It is famous for the traditional wooden houses that are dotted around the area. It is also the home to the Prime Minister of Korea - although his house is rather more grand.  The area is great for a pleasant stroll so that you can take in the sights and also create some great photos of the old houses with Seoul's rising skyline in the background. There is a small tourist office which provides a free walking map - not the best map in the world admittedly - however it's enough to show you where the main photo opportunities are and enough to get you back on track when you inevitably get lost around the myriad tiny alleyways.

Samcheong-dong is near to Gyeongbokgung Palace and is relatively near to Cheong Wa Dae (the Blue House a.k.a the President’s Office) and Insadong; both of which are tourist spots worth to visit. To get there just alight at the some subway station stop (Anguk Station, Subway Line No. 3) for Gyeongbokgung Palace.  Just follow the signs and you will find yourself at Samcheong-dong, one of the most unique places in Seoul where there is the hanok (traditional house made out of wood and put together without any nails) Bukchon Village. Samcheong-dong is a beautiful neighborhood and will definitely take more than half a day to take in the sights.  As it was evening time, there were many students on their way home after school and the crowd was lessened as compared to the last time I was there. It was literally an uphill task… it’s a hilly area with pretty steep slopes. We passed by a couple of familiar shops, but the night setting gave the area a slightly different feel and made it even more of an adventure.  Walking through the neighborhood peppered with both the traditional and modern is an enjoyable activity: some hanoks are occupied by residents while some are into chic galleries, restaurants, cafés and accessory shops.

I mostly followed the recommended walking course, since it is a residential area, but took a few little twists and turns along the way to get out of the crowded zones. It was really crowded when I went, but that may have been due to it being a national holiday. It was fun to see all of the intricate details that go into each of the hanoks, right down to the locks on the window covers. If you go early enough, you'll be able to participate in some of the craft-making options available. There's a whole area dedicated to traditional crafts up at the top of the hill.

It can get pretty busy with visitors on a nice day (which makes it hard to get good photos), but it is definitely worth a visit. To put it in perspective, Seoul is a city of 23 million, and packed into one of the highest densities on the planet.

However, please don't bring your whole suitcase because there wont be enough space for that & dragging the suitcase will be tough in the confusing alleyways. An over-nighter bag will do.

It's also immediately quieter from the 6 lane streets, so you can easily wander and window shop. I also loved the residential area of Bukchon but because it's a populated residential area, it is a bit awkward to be wandering with packs of other tourists around people's homes. There are a lot of signs up asking people to be respectful, and the residential area is technically only open until sundown - but most streets I turned down had several dozen people on them. It's hard to keep several dozen tourists quiet.

The architecture is interesting and the sliding doors similar to traditional Japanese houses. The view from the balcony overlooking the village was really awesome.

Pick up a map from the tourist information office as you enter the Bukchon Hanok area as this I found was a great help in navigating my way around the narrow streets. It was very popular and very busy with tourists so expect to be one of many as you walk this fabulous historic district. It is rather steep walking in places so probably not suitable for those in wheelchairs or those whom are not in great fitness.",Positive,0.9907,Positive

This is just a small village but as we were rushing for time, we didn't managed to visit the Traditional Culture Centre and probably covered only about 60% of the village alleys / streets. Definitely worth a return trip.  I really enjoyed admiring the well preserved and maintained traditional houses in the area. Some streets are filled with quaint looking little cafes (unfortunately they were mostly closed, even at 11am) and various souvenir / handicraft shops. We bought some hand-painted ceramic paintings and art prints in some of the shops there.  A friend gave me a Buchon Walking Map. Not sure where she got it from, perhaps the Tourist Info Centre or the Culture Centre. You can use the map to guide you around the alleyway, focusing on your area of interest.  Do take note though that some streets are very steep, and in winter, it can get really tricky, to manage the slippery streets (due to the melting snow). My kids and I came upon this section near the top of the hill, where the street was extremely slippery.

However in order to fully enjoy this place (in my opinion), you need to be relaxed and really like looking at the different structure of the Hanoks. We were on our own Free & Easy trip so we had no time restrictions... haha.. and go on a weekday, it seems alot of ppl will visit over the weekends... I feel sorry for the residents there over the weekends with all the crowd... Anyway be prepared to walk around and take photos...

There are signs along the narrow roads asking tourists to keep their voices down and no photos inside the residences out of respect the the privacy of the owners. A couple of the houses actually will give you a guided tour of the interior at a fee. We didn't do that, so just walked along the lanes and looked a the houses from the exterior. The neighbourhood is on a hillside and so a lot of places it's quite steep. You do get a good view at certain points though and there are some cute shops, cafes, and restaurants tucked in unexpected places. We happen upon a little cafe that was so cute. The shops etc. are not in the same area as the traditional houses though. We wandered beyond them but I couldn't say exactly in which direction.

This used to be a rundown and cramped lower middle class area which failed to draw attention by the destroy-anything-old syndrome of the 1970's and 80's building craze in Seoul. Most of the grand mansions down below on more habitable flat ground were long gone even before that period. Now there are only two homes worth mentioning in the area. One belonged to former President Yun--a 99-unit home in traditional Korean style. The other is at the summit of Bukchon--a genuine Victorian home. In any case, both homes are privately owned and not open to the public.  The small houses in Bukchon are also privately owned and are not possible to visit inside. Those few that are open to the public, you have to pay an entrance fee! Why on earth would anyone be interested in visiting a claustrophobic home that somehow avoided demolition decades ago? Bear in mind, they may be well-maintained now but are not homes built two, three centuries ago. It is shameful and embarrassing that there isn't a single area of grand old residential homes surviving in Seoul.  If quaint charm is what you are looking for, try Hannoversch Münden in Germany with homes more than 600 years old. Or Dinkelsbühl. Or San Gimignano in Italy. A bigger city? Try Florence. Bigger?

It was easy to get here and once you are on the main road you are immediately surrounded by lots of other tourists. The first tourist information booth we saw gave us a walking map which we followed. This was as good a way as any to see the area and get some scenic photo shots. Since we were there on a Sunday, most of the shops/houses that were not on the main road were closed. I was a bit disappointed by the whole thing since it didn't really feel like an 'old town' (in the European sense at least) but DH was very keen to get the photo and video shots so it was worth it for that. Overall, the area is overun by tourists all doing the same thing (heading for photo spots to snap away). If you like that kind of shopping it appeared to have lots of small boutique like shops around the main road which my teenage daughter found quite interesting. Otherwise, it lends itself to just walking around aimlessly taking in the atmosphere. Since it is located right between two palaces, it also makes for a good 'bridging attraction' between the two.

There the residential quiet along with the gorgeous views of the city and the fall colors took over. The actual ""traditional houses"" are largely either renovated or reconstructed to look old, but they are charming, especially when you come across a lane of them together.

2767,5.0,"Nestled behind the imposing and majestic Kyeong-Buk palace and a stones throw away from the president's residence 'the Blue House', Samcheong dong really is Seoul's best kept secret. Although it has an exclusive feel, it is very easy to get to: just follow the road which hugs the right side of the palace (if you stand at the entrance). Art galleries line the right side of the road and soon you will hit a feast of little artisan shops selling jewelry, shoes, clothes and other goodies. You would be forgiven if you got slightly confused as to whether you were in Europe or Asia. If your feet get tired, you can enjoy Korea's thriving cafe culture with a warming coffee and perhaps that cafe's special snacks and cakes. There are some very high quality restaurants on the main road which typically specialise in only one or two main dishes. You may think that you have seen enough on the main road, but do take the time to get lost in all the little alleyways. Don't worry, they all lead back to each other but it is in these tributaries where the true spirit of Samcheongdong can be discovered. You will see wall art, quirky shaped buildings, vintage clothes shops, ceramic wares for sale. You might even get to see a craftsman at work. I don't want to name specific places because the whole point is to go and find things for yourself with a blank canvas and open mind, but if you are fortunate enough to find the tiny alley cafe that sells patbingsoo, don't be put off by the fact that the waiting list is already an a4 side long....that's a quiet day! Samcheongdong is a refreshing celebration of creativity, self expression and talent.

The Bukchon Hanok Village is nestled between the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Changdeokgung Palace. It is located in the Insadong area of Seoul and an easy walk from the Angkuk subway station. The history of the village goes back 600 years, but the area has been preserved and reconstructed to the way it was. The narrow streets and the walls are all brick. Many winding hilly paths, and great views of the old Korean residential neighborhoods. There are still people living in these houses and also some people still working their businesses out of these houses. The problem is if you start on one path and continue, you my not see what is in the other direction. There really is no specific course to take so it is pretty much on your own instincts. There will be modern structures also as you go thru the area, maybe a place for a meal or drink and of course souvenirs, but not in a tacky way.

While you walk around, just be considerate, do not make too must noise, and try not to intrude into areas you are not suppose to go into. The view from the top is quite nice showing the old houses with the city view in the distance.

It is a great way to spend an afternoon walking through the narrow alleyways and taking photographs along the way. We booked a walking tour of this neighborhood which I strongly recommend. Our guide took us to see 8 spots in the village and each one had a different history. This village is situated between the 2 major palaces of Seoul so arrange to see at least one of them after you visit the village. Afterwards you can have lunch in one of the local restaurants along Samcheongdong.
