Even though we went in the evening, it was so crowded without proper ventilation I felt dizzy.  The local 7-11 has better AC than this.

There is a cinema and other forms of entertainment. Walk to the really 'cute' eating area (there are loads). I managed to find this one on the entrance level coming out of the Subway (at the back).

The digital wall reveal is amazing. The outside deck was scary fun.

300,1.0,"1. the mall is like any big mall in Korea, nothing special I think  2. my review is about the tower: positive: - outstanding View from the 117th to 121th floor, about 500m -> for that 1 point  negative: - expensive, adult 26000 Won per person - it took more than 70 min to get upstairs, all the procedures like security scan, taking photos to sell them later, just endless waiting in several rooms without a window, the air condition was turned on in stand by modus, there was just simply not enough refreshing cool air coming out of the aircon, nobody of the staff cared, you just were pushed through all the rooms like a herd of sheep There were no information about the waiting time. If i had knew that then i would have paid the fast check in ticket which costs 50000 Won.This is outrageous expensive but in retrospect worth it. Of course first of all you must afford this price. Everyone who is able to do it should do it because when you stand in the queue for about 50 min and you see the fast tracker who paid more because they „knew“ and they are passing through the middle line to the elevator then the damn legs are hurting even more and you are still not in the elevator. Because they skip the queue, the waiting people have to wait longer, maybe your spot in the elevator was taken by one of the high payers. - show room was closed - the outside terrace was closed - the service and the staff processes have to optimize a lot I think - started at the end of the queue at 16.30, to see the Sunset. We arrived round about 17.45 in the 118th floor. Then it was dark night. The windows are reflecting the inside light so the pictures you make are always with co-displayed with people around you - downstairs same procedure: another QUEUE, the second one. A little bit faster downstairs, round about 45min, but still too much time lost. The sightviewing floors are big enough, there was no hustle, so the main problem was the ONE and ONLY elevator (of obviously 2) which was opened for the mass of visitors. - the 2 walk with bottom glas view are not that impressive because you know you are standing on glas, all the floor glasses are full of scratches - in the queue: NO SITTING  Conclusion: Lack of process optimization. Great view but just go there when you have enough time and air in your lungs or enough money in your pocket to buy you a fast lane ticket! Go there early enough to see the city by daylight and take some pictures without reflecting of the night indoor lights. Prepare it to the Eiffel Tower in Paris it isnt that irritating like in Lotte Tower or the Empire State Building in N.Y., there are timeslots there and you can buy the tickets simply online, in english! My opinion!  To the operators: this stay (2019) in Seoul we decided to stay at Park Hyatt Hotel but we had also considered the Signiel Hotel. The best view was the most important factor in this years hotel choice. Next year, i do travel to Korea once a year because of my family, it won’t be the Signiel again.

Once you get up to the top via the elevator you can go higher up using the escalators as there are 3 more viewing floors. Coffee shop and sweet shop available.

313,5.0,The Lotte Tower is an amazing place to visit and must be on your list of things to do in Seoul. It's a little pricey for admission but well worth it.

We noticed that for Lotte World and Lotte Tower alone the tickets for those single attractions were close to $45. We filled an entire day with these Lotte attractions and had so much fun! The Lotte World Tower was a highlight of our trip! We ate at the 123 Lounge on the 123rd floor, it was a little pricey but what you would expect for a high end bar/restaurant with a view like that! Lotte World was almost like a smaller disney with the restaurants, rides, indoor ice rink and gift shops. I can imagine this would be a great place for kids, but even as two adults we had a blast! We went on a Saturday so it was very crowded, I would suggest going on a school day because we saw one of the lines for a ride reached a 2 hour wait with a line that wrapped around the Magic Island zone.

322,4.0,"While on a mixed business / family trip to Seoul earlier this year, we went to the Lotte World Tower because it seemed to be the area in Seoul with the earliest cherry blossoms. Sorry, this review is obviously a little late because this annual event obviously takes place in April but better late than never. So if you happen to be in Seoul and the cherry blossom season is just starting (usually early April) this would be the place to go to, in particular the 2 small lakes just to the South of the Lotte WT&M. It's lovely and full with people taking pictures and I would imagine it will be quite nice during the rest of year also. The shopping mall itself is amazingly large, there's everything but like with lots of these big malls, it's full of branded shops which tend to be more expensive. So this is probably not the place to come for local, cheap goodies. But worthwhile if you like shopping. There are plenty of restaurants and a lot of them look very tempting. Lots of different foods but the one that caught our eye was a very small local Korean restaurant which seemed to be only frequented by staff working in the World Tower and Mall. It was very cheap with very tasty food, the surroundings matched the price, very simple and very few decorations but if you want to fill up your stomach without spending an awful lot of time in a restaurant, then go to MyeongDong Halmoni Kalguksu (명동할머니국수), which you can find in the Seoul Seoul 3080 restaurant area on the 6F. I tried to find this restaurant for review separately but it's not yet listed on TripAdvisor, hence I'll mention it here. I'd go definitely go there again for the quality of the food at rock bottom prices. The Tower itself is massively tall and quite pretty. We didn't go to the top, mainly because we had no time and it's also quite expensive, compared to going up Seoul Tower in the city centre (separate review). Certainly an area of Seoul which you should put on your list when visiting.",Positive,0.9899,Positive

The elevator to the top rises 118 floors in one minute. The views are great! I would shoot for off-season and I like the views best at night. This is one of those places that easily gets jammed with tourists at the wrong time. The observation deck has a glass floor and just a net over the top to catch things falling from above.

Photos are tricky during the day because the external water stains are awful and at night there's the light reflecting off the glass in some places but with 360 viewing you're bound to capture a few great shots. Note there is an airport type security check before heading into the elevators. I didn't have anything of note but not sure what you'd do if you have something not allowed up. Inside the elevator the ceiling and walls light up with an amazing show as if you're flying into space. On the ride down there is a fireworks show on the ceiling and walls. Unbelievably fast ride considering the trip up 120+ floors.

366,4.0,"We visited the Lotte World Tower in February, only visiting the Mall as a means of accessing the Tower.  Quite a pricey visit, although we were pleasantly surprised to receive a discount for using a Mastercard to pay for our tickets, which then worked out at 48000 KrWon for two of us. There are a number of corridors to walk through, with images screened on the walls, before you arrive at the elevator - a double decker and very fast. You also have the opportunity to have a photo taken with a chosen image on a green screen behind you, a similar opportunity is in place at the top of the tower, but there is no pressure to take part.  It was all relatively quiet at this time of year but the length of corridors and screens indicate that they are there to keep visitors engaged during the busy season and that queues could get extremely long.  The lift ride up to the 117th floor was rapid, ears popping en route, and more images being screened on the walls of the lift as we travelled.  The public floors at the top of the tower are more compact than one would imagine, well organised with plenty of seating around the central section. We felt it was far less commercialised than Taipei 101, with plenty of staff available but a pretty much hands off approach.  There is a glass floor section for the brave, where you can look out or down over 100 floors. Not for the faint-hearted but a good photo opportunity. There are also two 'observation decks', which have a double door arrangement to maintain temperature within the tower. A member of staff regulates entry and exit to these decks. It was dark by the time we accessed these, the buildings were all lit up and car lights blended in along the roads out of the city and it was spectacular.  Views are wonderful. I don't think Seoul is a particularly attractive city, but this was a good way to see it and the height added something. The skies had been clear blue when we entered the Mall but, unfortunately, by the time we emerged at the top, everything was rather misty and cloudy, hence our best photos came after the sun set. Any visit is at the mercy of the weather and, particularly in February, you do take a calculated risk if you are hoping for good photos.  There are a number of retail outlets at the top of the tower with, as one would expect, Tower themed souvenirs, ranging from postcards to much more ambitious items. Prices not as hyped up as one might imagine. Bizarrely a 'pick n mix' sweet counter and a cafe, an ice cream counter and a bar lounge.  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would recommend it.",Positive,0.9975,Positive

The amusement park was pretty cool, lots of English everywhere, and the rides were fun, but the highlight for me was the folk museum.  Maybe it was just because it was quieter than many of my experiences in Seoul, but it was a welcome break from the cutting edge tourism experience. The folk museum presented Korean history in engaging dioramas and excellent placards explaining the different historical periods of Korea. The highlight of the highlight though, were the huge handmade dioramas of traditional Korean life. The care and thought that went into them is enough reason to visit the museum.

374,4.0,"Our American family of five, kids ages 10, 13 and 16, visited the Lotte Tower with a native South Korean. It was very nice to have our friend there, but his interpretation skills were really not necessary. We were not there to go shopping, but rather to have the Sky Tower experience. The cue area was empty for our morning visit, but if you had to stand in line, there are interesting things to look at while you wind yourself through the maze. The elevator is filled with tv screens and the ride up is amazing and beautiful. It stops near the very top and then visitors can take their time in visiting each of the floors, until they reach the very top, the 123rd floor, which consists of an expensive restaurant/lounge. Be sure to go on a relatively clear day, because you will be able to see for kilometers. Regardless of the weather, throughout much of the year the ""very fine dust that blows over from Eastern China"" obscures the view. We all liked the clear floor, so we could see straight down to the ground below. As an American from the suburbs it is impressive to see the hundreds and hundreds of apartment buildings that house the majority of South Korea's population. This was a very different experience from the Seoul Tower, which honestly I preferred.

There is a family discounted price for 2 adults and 2 children, the tickets totalled 87,000 won, as compared to buying them individually at 27,000 won for each adult.  If you have visited the Lotte Aquarium, the ticket stub will also provide you with some discount on individual tickets (discount does not apply to the already discounted family package).  There is also some discounts for senior citizen, do ask the counter staff at ticketing booth before paying.  This is well worth the visit as you get to see the city of Seoul for 360 degrees and this is the sixth tallest tower in the world with a height of 500 metres.",Positive,0.9217,Positive

There are multiple floors when you get up: one with a glass floor and another with an outdoor area, so there is lots to see and from different viewpoints. It was extremely well organized and staff very professional and polite. The view was incredible, you can see for very far over the city and the river. Just make sure to go on a clear day.

422,5.0,The Lotte World Tower & Mall is the perfect spot for tourists who are in Seoul for the first time. With 28.000 KRW per adult it’s a bit expensive but in my opinion it‘s worth it.

I was just so amazed how kids fear nothing - they lay on it and they even jumped up and down! ""STOP PLEASE!!!"" I screamed in my heart!  Tip: Check the sunset time and plan your trip.

Both sides have glass floors, so there really isn't a line to wait to walk on glass. Theres a cafe, wifi, and some cool museum pieces. I got to to look at Napoleans hat and some hand written letters by him.. who would have thought while touring in Korea I would get some french history under my belt. Great for all types of tourists!

431,4.0,"We went early, and they have an early bird special so before noon it was a few thousand won cheaper. Since the building is on the east side of the city, if you go in the morning the sun will be behind you and you'll have a nice view to the rest of the city of the west. It turned out to be a really good view. I would also assume sunset is the other best time to go.  Most of the floors are the same and it's your standard ""going up a tall building"" experience with a fancy elevator ride and an expensive gift shop up on the top. Seoul isn't really gorgeous from this eastern part of the city and the view consists mostly of endless rows of apartment blocks, Lotte World, hills, and the admittedly impressive Han River.

434,5.0,"Located in the southern region of Seoul below the Han river, Lotte World Tower is one of the city's must-see attractions. At almost a half a kilometre tall (over 1,600 feet), on a sunny day it can cast a shadow in the sky and provides stunning 360 degree views of the vast metropolis. Taking only around sixty seconds to reach the multi-level viewing deck, you can step onto caged outside balconies, stand on a glass floor looking down onto busy traffic, take photos with ubiquitous kawaii mascots and marvel at the flawless overall undertaking and accompanying production (LED screens, computer graphics). Unlike other sky-high decks visited, the attraction doesn't have add-on charges for other experiences once you're up there - a welcome change to the usual tourist up-sell. Visited on a weekday, the number of visitors was relatively low and allowed ample opportunities to take the perfect photo. Entry is via the basement, which is part of the larger Lotte World mall.  The mall itself offers plenty of local and international fashion brands in addition to a vast variety of retail, loads of food and beverage options and can be travelled to and from via the complex's underground railway station. The mall is spread over two buildings, one of which is the glamorous home to upscale couture boutiques. While unvisited, adjacent to the mall is the Lotte World theme park.",Positive,0.9818,Positive

437,4.0,"Lotte World Tower or ""Seoul Sky"" is much like other observation deck experiences. As you buy your tickets you can check what the weather and visibility is like. Prices were reasonable. Got a 9000kw discount as it was my birthday month (need to prove with passport). There is security screens, a bit of queuing and photos to be taken before you get to the elevator. But having been to other Observation Towers, this is not unusual. The fancy super video screens were though. The price of the photos was very good!! Up the top there's a few levels. One allows you to go outside, and another has the glass floor to test your brain (I struggle to step out into the glass floor). One level had a video to show what old Korea looked like compared to now which was interesting. We checked out the top most observation deck, where you had to purchase food or drink to attend, but it was 27000kw for a chicken sandwich so we passed. It was the first time we had seen really inflated prices so we were shocked. But overall it was a good experience. Only a must see if you like seeing the sprawling city. Back on the ground floor in the mall was s really nice restaurant that had Italian food - pizza, pasta and a lamb salad that was to die for!! But I know, you don't go to Korea for Italian food but when you're with a bunch of ex-pats they are hanging for a taste of what they miss from home!! and pizza and salad are hard to find!!",Positive,0.9743,Positive

443,5.0,"We wandered into this place quite accidentally. After going to the Lotte mall, my 11 year old son suggested we go to the top of the tower and see the whole city. We went and asked the security man and were introduced to Seoul Sky. A very interesting lift ride with distraction videos on its walls took us to 117th floor. From here there are escalators to the higher floors. On 118th floor, there is a glass floor observatory where the brave can stand and the timid can take photos anyway. Can be quite scary but I lay on my back instead of standing and took some selfies showing the streets below. On every level you can take photos of Seoul. For example the Han river and Olympic Park. There is a place for photos which you buy or you can take your own. There are also souvenir shops and I think there was a small cafe. Then back to the lift and down to the mall. It was an awesome experience despite some cloudiness.",Positive,0.7617,Positive
444,5.0,"You might be curious about visiting the Lotte World Tower, and rightfully so. It's the 5th-tallest building in the world, but many don't realize it has the third-highest observation deck on the planet! This is a rare structure in which your head will surpass 500m above the ground, something that wasn't even possible until the past decade.  One level features a glass floor, for those who are daring enough to walk out, and two small outdoor decks with protective netting if you want to smell the air up there. They offer plenty of souvenirs and even a tiny bit of food. But don't bank on having dinner up there. Much like the World Trade Center in New York, you're treated to a visual montage on the elevator ride up so you can appreciate the evolution of the surrounding city.  And while you're here, you might as well go below ground to the insanely massive mall with endless stores and excellent dining options. Eventually, you find yourself at an aquarium and an ice rink.

I love the views, the gift shops, and the restaurants up the Tower. The restaurants are a little pricey though lol! Go during the day or night, you will definitely have plenty of picturesque view of the city underneath you! There's also a place where you can go outside and experience a nice breeze!

452,5.0,"There is an expression, “You’ll know it when you see it”. It could also be said, “You’ll know it when you feel it”. From the second we entered the Lotte World Tower, a sensation came over me as I looked up at the endless high ceiling. Before I go any further let me state, for you to truly experience this magnificent hotel you should have the option to experience the elements of surprise. Therefore, I will present only basic facts enough to peak your interest without giving away all the unique features you will experience. If you were to google a map of Seoul the most obvious feature you will notice is a building towering above all other structures. The Lotte World Tower is the tallest building in South Korea, reaching 123 floors at a height of 1,819 feet. It is the fifth tallest building in the world. Just for the record, our room number was 9882! That is correct the 98th Floor! The view was breathtaking and certainly the highest floor we have had the pleasure of staying for the night. The hotel is connected to the Lotte World Mall. The Mall is exceptionally large, modern and beautiful offering a host of famous brand names with numerous places to eat with a variety of delicacies from around the world. In the basement of the hotel is an outstanding Aquarium truly worth visiting. Their specious lounge, is a place we frequently visited to relax and enjoy the panoramic view of the city located on the 79th floor. There is an outstanding observation deck located on the 123-floor overlooking the city. From our room we could see the river that was incredible especially when watching the city lights at night. The hotel of course offers all the amenities found only in the top luxury hotels. Wait until you see your uniquely designed room especially the bathroom! I highly recommend you take advantage of their outstanding breakfast. Everything is fresh and with a variety of choices that are professionally served. My suggestion is order their smoothie, the combinations of taste is exceptionally delicious. Of all the highlights offered by any hotel it always comes down to the quality of service by the staff. Having travelled around the world the personnel at the Signiel hotel we would rate above outstanding. Their kindness and efficiency is second to none and they make you feel right at home. We consider the whole complex a “City within a city”. Seoul has hundreds of top end hotels to choose from but, if you want to truly experience something from a fancy world, the choice is obvious. It certainly captured our hearts the moment the doors were open. On a personal note, when visiting a new hotel, I always make a concretive effort to try and find flaws. Paying particularly attention to the smallest details to challenge their efforts to put their best foot forward. I can honestly say without hesitation; this hotel is truly a Perfect 10!",Positive,0.9966,Positive
453,5.0,"On my last evening in Seoul , I saw this amazing building from my hotel room ! Nobody had told me about it , so I arranged to go by taxi and was invited by a Korean friend to visit The Signiel hotel . This building is stunning . I was staggered by the scale of it and from a distance it has a kind of timeless futurist design . As we approached it by taxi , it was dusk and the dynamic lighting of the complex at the foot of this mountain of a building was very state of the art ... we went up to the top floors of the viewing tower . And the video installations in the corridors were breathtaking . The elevator has 360 video art which distracts from the fact that we rise 101 floors in 60 seconds .. the views from the top at night are the pride of modern South Korean life !! Seoul looks like a perfect Eutopia from this viewpoint . The Signiel Hotel is also like stepping into a SF movie .. mega expensive, but worth it !!",Positive,0.9491,Positive

In Seoul Sky there are a few cafes, a gift shop and a restaurant. The views are spectacular. It is worth the 27000 won for adults.

The lake is sort of divided into two sections, separated by a bridge, but one could walk around the whole lake along the walkway.

After you pay your entrance fee you are taken to the lifts which take you to the observation platforms. The lift in itself is a bit of an experience – there are screens on all the walls and the ceiling which display a short show about the tower while you are riding up.  The towers are impressively tall, and from that distance you lose perspective of how high up you actually are. There are several observation deck levels, and each deck has something different on offer. There is a level that has a couple of glass floor areas where you can look down to the street below (that's a bit freaky at first!), there's a level where you can go to a balcony area, there is a cafe and when we were there there were displays commemorating the winter Olympics and some statues of the Olympic mascots that you could have photos with.

You can take a good profil photos and also you can catch beautiful city view. It gives you a 360 degree city view. I went up the tower in the evening. I was unlucky that the weather was so foggy. So be sure that the weather is clear. You can go daytime and also evening. Two of these situations give you a different beauty of the city. Han river, Namsan Tower, Gangnmam etc... To go up the tower gives you a valuable opportunity to see all of city districts. The cost wast a little bit expensive but it worth. It was 27000 Won as you see in the photo that I uploaded. . The appropriate time to spend there is approximately between 1 and 1.5 hour. You can stay more because there is no limitation to stay there.

542,5.0,This is the 5th in the world and 4th in Asia. I've seen the others and this compares favourably. The architecture us classical yet beautiful. Connected to an amazing huge futuristic mall.  Located at Jamsil area. The observation deck from floors 117 upward costs about $50 but the queue is extreme.  Plenty of food choices in the mall. But be prepared to wait,Positive,0.7814,Positive

544,5.0,"Yes, I would rate this as my first choice of favorite super towers, and I've seen a lot of them around the world. Mainly I am impressed with the design and technology along with the great variety of things to do in this tower.  It just opened a few months ago and at 123 floors above ground and 6 floors below ground (parking), it contains practically everything you would ever want. Plan on going VERY EARLY at opening and spend all day. We were there for 2 days. The observation decks are on the top 5 floors (117-123), a hotel from about the 75th to about the 100th floor, residences around the 42nd to 70th floor, and private offices higher up. At 1,800 feet tall, you better not have a fear of heights to visit. Also, this place is very crowded. Furthermore, there is an aquarium, movie theatre, more shops than you can visit in a day, and places to eat although later in the afternoon and evening, it is practically impossible to get anything to eat without waiting a VERY LONG TIME. I this there is approximately 3 million square feet in this mega structure. It can be seen from anywhere in Seoul and one of the top 5 tallest in the world as they claimed. As expected, there is security to get into the building, but not a big deal.  The roughly $50 US dollar cost to express up to the observation decks is much too expensive in our opinion, yet worth it for a one time experience. The transparent floors (some people say glass floors) on the observation deck is incredible. Some people were to scared to stand on them. The elevator to get up there is large, fast, and unique with video displays and high tech. It's the most unusual elevator I've ever seen. Going back done after being up on the observation decks for almost an hour, the staff couldn't manage getting the large number of people in the elevator. Lots of people packed in there with people touching us on all sides. Fortunately it is about only a minute up and down. Ears popping due to the fast speed, yet smooth ride so you don't sense how fast it is moving.  If you come later in the day you will regret being lazy as the lines for mostly anything are long; tickets, elevators, restaurants, etc.  If you are going for the tower and the view, choose a good clear day. One couple told me they were there the prior day and disappointed that they were in the clouds and saw nothing after paying 50,000 Korean Won. I mentioned did they consider standing on the ground and looking up to see if the top of the tower is visible before buying the ticket? If you can't see it when looking up, then you won't see anything when you get up there. No common sense with those folks.  If you are not interested in the tower, you can spend a whole day just shopping or looking around at all the unique sculptures, art, and shops (some affordable and some are high end expensive items).  My rating does not include the fact that in my opinion, this place is not really for elderly people or folks with strollers and wheel chairs as it is much too crowded and no place to sit or rest.  If you go to Seoul and don't visit, then you will miss out on a great experience.",Positive,0.9174,Positive
545,5.0,I must say this has got to be one of the best towers that I have visited. Its not the typical tower that you see when you visit a city which is usually one floor. Here they have 3 floors with the 20thF being the best because of the glass bottom floor and the open balcony. Aside from having a fantastic view of the city you can instantly post your pics as there wifi is really strong considering how high we were. Really worth the visit,Positive,0.9571,Positive

You can go up to a floor and then you have several floors to see and even 2 outdoor terraces Its a cafeteria and a nice shop where we bought a magnet!! Then when you go down I recommend to eat at the Mall, you have several options and for example ""On tge Border"", ""Pizza and Pasta"" or ""Hard Rock""",Positive,0.9558,Positive

552,4.0,"I took the Sky Shuttle to the top of the tower. It was not a very busy day for it, but they still packed you into the elevator like sardines. It would have been a much more enjoyable ride if they had 2 or 3 less people on the elevator. You literally have people pressing up against you on every side. Once we got to the observation deck I was disappointed to look out the glass and discover we were in the clouds, you couldn't see anything. It would have been nice if they had warned you before you bought your tickets that you wouldn't be able to see much. There were a couple small breaks in the clouds and you could see a little bit of the ground, but then all the rain running down the windows made good pictures nearly impossible. When it was time to line back up for the elevator to go back down, there seemed to be no order to the line, people were cutting the line, pushing & shoving. It would be a great experience on a nice day if the staff did a better job of managing the crowd.",Positive,0.9654,Positive

I was greeted by Mike the manager and had a great conversation with him. He is fluent in both Korean and English so locals & international travelers wont have any trouble communicating with him if they have any modifications they wish to make or concerns about allergies and such. Lobsters are live and cooked in front of you. This is a must try if you're in Seoul & a seafood lover like myself. Don't miss this gem in the Lotte World Mall!  PS.

Naturally, one would not want to miss out on an opportunity to stand at its observation deck on one of the top floors, and it is with this determination that I have to part with a fairly hefty KRW 27,000 entrance fees. The top draw in the observation deck is undisputedly the glass bottom which truly tests your fear for heights and is not for the faint-hearted. The 360 degrees view from the top is spectacular but only if the weather is permitting. The Lotte World Tower is attached to a modern shopping mall and an aquarium which will easily occupy your 1-day itinerary.

There is also an Express-Ticket for 50.000 WON to pass the lines at the elevator etc.  Going up by the high speed elevator is nice and just takes a minute.  The multi-floor observation deck has a coffee lounge, photo stand, souvenir shop and two glass bottom areas. Also there are two outside terraces.

There's outdoor access @ level 120 where we experienced strong gust of cold winds.  Photo taking provided by Seoul Sky @ ground level before we get to enter, which we can buy the hard copy later on. Maybe it was their 1st day of opening with the massive controlled crowds, it would have been better if they let us know we don't look good in the photo and re-take another shot. Still we got the hard copies, 1st one for 12,000 won and the 2nd photo for an additional of 5,000 won. (Total of 17,000 won ). As at point of ordering photos, we could not see clearly from the computer screen if it was good either.  Explained from the fridge magnet which I had bought. - Lotte world Tower's main motif is Korean traditional porcelain and brush. The tower's appearance expresses ""the beauty of curve"" architecturally, with the design of becoming narrow as it goes high. Also the state of the art technique called ""diagrid structure"" is applied. Diagrid is a compound word of ""diagonal"" and ""grid"", the structure enhances the ability to endure typhoon and earthquake.

601,2.0,"in reality the ""onspot"" tax refund works only in a very limited amount of cases. Today i've tried to claim my tax on spot in the Lotte World. And quess what? i'm only receiving it at the airport! The rason being I had a Maser card with me, and supposedly they will only do return with a MasterCard if you are leaving the country within 4 days. I was said that they only accept visa cards to do cash refund, if you plan to leave in more than 4 days. My question ""why?????"" got the answer: 'cause it's Korea.  P. S. it was an ""orange"" tax refund company.",Negative,0.3525,Positive
602,3.0,"The world tower and mall are certainly impressive to view, as the architect has cleverly added a false perspective, making the tower seem higher than it really is. The mall is glittery and golden, with slippery marble floors and a myriad of shopkeepers and outlest vying for the tourist dollar. Myeong-dong in Soeul has all the same stuff, and at lower prices.",Negative,0.7783,Positive
603,4.0,"Many shops, adventure park(amusement park), restaurants, department stores, super amrkets, aquarium, cinema, etc, all of these attractions are in this spot. Couple of days are required if you want to shop and look around the place, Coex was like that before its renovation but now, I feel that Lotte world mall tower area replaced it. Even if the department store basement food court close around 20:00 or 20:30, other supermarkets are still open till midnight, If you go before closing, you can get very good quality food with discounted priace at the department basement. If you have kids, it is also good place to have fun at the adventure or aquarium.",Positive,0.9725,Positive
604,5.0,this is a new and high end mall located near the Jamsil Station and Lotte World Amusement Park. it is filled with international brand apparel and food.,Positive,0.3612,Positive
605,4.0,"It's possible to find almost anything at Lotte mall. Lots of high-end stores, brand-stores and international shops. There are not that many quaint or special shops. Would go elsewhere if your time in Seoul as a tourist is scarce. What we found terrible and rather disturbing (as Scandinavians) was the treatment of the animals in a pet shop. Small dogs in very small transparent boxes looked sad out of their cages. This is not a way to treat dogs - and we were amazed that this was possible at an international mall. Have never seen anything like it.",Positive,-0.7887,Negative
606,4.0,"Visited this mall with my boyfriend. It sells a lot of branded goods as well as other recognized (but more affordable) brands' goods. There are also a lot of restaurants and cafes in the mall. The goods sold range from clothings, bags, electronic devices, and many more. Visit this mall once, walk and look around it. You might find something you need.",Positive,0.2732,Positive
