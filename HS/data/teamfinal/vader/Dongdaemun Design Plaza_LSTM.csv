285,5.0,"I spent an hour and half walking and admiring, in the night, this structure that was designed by late Zaha Hadid, an Iraqi-born British world-renowned architect. It has certainly inspired me on the “Dream, Design and Play” (DDP) concept behind the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP).  Getting there: Take Subway Line 2, 4, 5 to get to Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station and then take exit 1, which is connected to the DDP. Once you walk out the exit of subway station, the DDP just on the left. Climb the lighted stairs to reach the street level for appreciation of DDP.  The attraction: If you are at the DDP during the day, I would recommend a walk around the DDP to appreciate of the unique architecture of the structure – it is built on curves and I did not see any sharp corner and long straight walls! It is mentioned that over 40,000 aluminium panels cover the DDP exterior of which none is the same. I would also recommend a walk inside the DDP - consists of a sky lounge, rest area, souvenir shop and 5 exhibition halls: Art Hall, Museum, Design Laboratory, Oullim Square and Dongdaemun History & Culture Park.  It is at night when the DDP really came alive! The lightings simply accentuate and dazzle the structure. Most of the yellow-white lightings even “moved” where these gradually intensified and then dimmed again. Participating in the “night life” is the Rose Garden with a total of some 25,550 LED roses.  Not only the architecture dazzled at night, the artistic talent was also on show when I saw and heard 2 different pianists playing the 2 pianos located in the open.  I walked across to the apM Place Shopping Mall and took the elevator to a high floor to get a bird’s eye view of DDP. I think you can also get a nice view from the high floor of other buildings (for example the Lotte Fitin Shopping Mall)  Overall, I enjoyed Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) in the night more than in the day. Nevertheless, this is one iconic landmark in Seoul that you would not want to miss! It is no wonder that many Korean dramas were filmed here as well, including “You Who Came from the Stars”, “Producer” and “She Was Pretty”.",Positive,0.9883,Positive
286,4.0,"DDP is Zaha Hadid design and definitely the icon of Dongdaemun. There are a couple of subway stations that stop directly underneath or nearby, hence easy to get to. The Plaza overall is quite large in size, with shops, exhibitions and art installations. There are leaderboards with maps in many locations hence easy to find your way around. Nearby DDP are underground shopping, night markets, Dongdaemum Gate, a couple fo hotels and plenty of shops and restaurants. Dongdaemun and DDP are must visit sights when in Seoul.",Positive,0.743,Positive

Designed by the late internationally acclaimed Pritzker Architecture Prize recipient, visionary Zaha Hadid, Dongdaemun Design Plaza, frequented by both tourists and locals, greets all with the notable humanistic art of architecture. It imparts a feeling of liquid, fluid metal. Seoul, the capital city of South Korea, home to 10 million people, is a modern world mega-city, designated in the year 2010 as the “World Design Capital.” It is indeed fitting that he Dongdaemun Design Plaza so elegantly captures the beauty and energy of Seoul.  The Dongdaemun Design Plaza is home to the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park, featuring the Dongdaemun Relic Area 2, an archaeological site discovered at the former baseball field of the Dongdaemun Stadium Complex, yielding knowledge about the life of Korean people during the Joseon period. The tile-paved path believed to relate to the Japanese colonial period connects the building sites and the Well Site and Fireplace Feature depicted along the path. The dual-languages of the signage of the site are Korean and English. In the midst of this extraordinary mega-city of Seoul, resides peace and tranquility.

Before you get to the building there is a mayor plaza and a walking street/ramp that leads you to the heart of it. The entrance is beneath the full structure.  The DDP of its name means: Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) has the meaning of 'Dream, Design and Play' as far as I was informed. The place is also famous and renowned for it has staged diverse cultural events including exhibitions, fashion shows, product launch shows, forums and conferences.  DDP's exterior features over 40,000 aluminum panels, none of which are the same. As I mentioned before the plaza is home to various exhibition spaces, design museum, sky lounge, rest area and a souvenir shop.  Is really a beauty of Art, and Architecture as well as Technology.

This is the place for those that do not fancy the bazaar style shopping as in Namdaemun market. This place has a few big malls for fashion mostly. It has even has two underground shopping malls.

The remains of historical buildings in and amongst the futuristic mega buildings were the most interesting parts of the park. Overall, the sheer bleakness of the interior was fascinating, but I was very frustrated at the lack of museum content. The one small exhibit gallery with exhibits in it was okay, but not of a scale to fit this giant park. So, be aware that besides the giant swooping building, there isn’t anything else to see.

329,5.0,"As an architecture buff, I found this plaza in Seoul to feature one of the most innovative modern structures that I have seen. I first visited the 7-level (4 above ground and 3 below) building during the day and was so impressed that I returned to introduce the center to my husband that night. Designed by architect Zaha Hadid, the futuristic construction exhibits no straight lines or right angles. Instead, it presents elongated, curvy forms, built with concrete and cloaked in 45,000 aluminum panels.  At night, the center’s lights seem to glow from within. At certain exterior vantage points, its shape and silvery hue give the impression of what I imagine a giant spaceship to look like. The park next to the building further enhances the look. It holds 25,550 LED roses, which light up 5 minutes after sunset and are absolutely stunning. It was a magical experience to stroll here in the dark.  Inside, the curves continue in long corridors and connecting stairways (there are also standard elevators). The center serves as a fairly new venue for design in Seoul, featuring an art hall, meeting space, a museum, a design lab and a design market. I visited the huge lab, which displays a variety of well-crafted items for sale and gives visitors the opportunity to meet the designers. We enjoyed a light dinner in one of the many eateries in the market, which is connected to the nearby Dongdaemun shopping centers.  DDP, located in Downtown Seoul, is easily reached by subway. Take Line 2, 4 or 5 to Dongdaemun History and Culture Park Station and leave through exits 1 or 10.",Positive,0.9758,Positive

There also was a Disney store and lots of silkscreened animation scenes from the likes of Frozen, Big Hero 6, and Moana. On the second floor was an art museum.

Yes, amidst Seoul’s skyline, the DDP’s facade is aesthetically unique for it’s fluid lines and steel curvatures. There is no doubt, its sheer outline exudes design.  But once, we appreciated the swooping façade and geometries, there is just emptiness inside the building: empty rooms, empty echoey corridors and vast empty spaces. For a designer, space is a design element but when we went (around 4 pm on April 17) there were no exhibits, no permanent showcase not even, food trucks. Just one big EMPTY building.

Just like zaha always did, she made DDP the an unusual construction and a representation of dongdaemun or even the whole Seoul.  I always like zaha’s design and think it very cool to take photo here. You can take very instergrammable photos inside or outside the building since the the Zaha style is everywhere here.  If you hope to take some pure architecture photos, I would recommend you to come the eighth floor of lotte FITIN which is a shopping mall facing to DDP. There are lots of clean windows allowing you to take amazing photos of DDP at night. In contrast, there are some buildings nearby where you can not take satisfying photos for its dirty windows and terrible views.",Positive,0.9189,Positive

The building is truly stunning and the design resembles something from the future or like an extra-terrestrial space ship. You can wander around the outside, underneath and inside and the different views of the building continually surprise.  Inside there were many things happening. There is a huge and fantastic play area for children, an exhibition of Wallace & Grommit, many shops and restaurants and cultural and art displays. Even the stairways in the building are far from normal and cleverly designed.  Probably the best time to visit is in the evening time and at night when the building comes to life with subtly placed lights so it even more resembles a flying saucer or space ship.  During our visit in the evening time, there were stands outdoors where people were selling handcrafted items such as jewellery, singers and musicians performing, and food trucks from the Seoul Bamdokkaebi Night Market offering all kinds of really delicious local and foreign snacks and street food.",Positive,0.9847,Positive

It remained modestly unobtrusive, retaining the harmony and yet feature it's avant-garde intent.  For families, they can pop by the Kakao shop for photo opportunities with the cute figurines there.

Despite the heavy rain, a trip there to see the exhibition was very worthwhile. The exhibition has already gone to Germany and Australia, and is in Seoul now. Lucky I could catch it here.

I like Namdaemun market more than Gwangjang market because the street food is better. I'm not a big souvenir shopper so once you see 1 market, they're pretty much the same except for the food variety. If you're tight on time, you can stay in this area and skip Myeongdong and Namdaemun. They're pretty much the same but this area is cleaner and more modern. If street food is more important to you and you're shopping for eyeglasses, Myeongdong and Namdaemun have more street food variety and eyeglasses selections.",Negative,0.8817,Positive

It was so full of information, that one visit would not be enough to soak in all the knowledge. We had a tour guide and that worked out really well because she saved us from having to read and glean all the information ourselves. She highlighted everything for us and answered all our questions. Even that took some time. The tour may be enough for some people, but those who really want to delve into the exhibit can return and use the tour guide as a roadmap for tackling everything. The other part of the exhibit was located in Donuimun Museum Village and we went there as well. They really complemented each other very well. Well worth a day trip and a return visit, time allowing.",Positive,0.9691,Positive
604,2.0,"The building and the history points on site are nice but otherwise it's just shops on the inside.  My girlfriend said it was one of the top ten things to see in Seoul, but I reckon you could safely miss this one.",Negative,0.7579,Positive

The shops downstairs offer designer gadgets, clothing, home accessories, toys, etc. It is an incredible place, and the coffee shop is nice, I suggest getting a mango beverage.",Positive,0.4215,Positive

610,4.0,The Design centre has several exhibition floors where you can find both local and overseas designers with their innovative art products. Some are of artistic value while others are product of daily use. Some special exhibitions are free of charge on Eednesday. The souvenir shop on ground floor features a lot of innovative gadgets. Worth a half day visit.,Positive,0.9337,Positive
611,5.0,"Even if you aren't interested in the exhibition inside, visit at night and walk around the complex. The lighting reveals how magical this architecture is. It will surely steal a lot of photo taking moments.  When you visit inside during the daytime, you will even more amazed how marvellous this architecture is. You will be like strolling along exhibits on the walkway rather than in exhibition rooms. Without knowing, you will already be on the top floor or bottom floor. There are lifts inside but if your physique allows, try walking.",Positive,0.3854,Positive

621,5.0,t must go there. A magnificient design. Like a museum but it's more than that. Should visit on Saturday's night. They have a garden of neon roses. So great.,Positive,0.8334,Positive
622,3.0,"The museum building is amazing (5 stars) and worth seeing by itself which is almost the case. Is the museum a work-in-progress or has funding been reduced? There was a room full of chair showing design changes since 1932, an innovative play area for small children and that's about it. They were working on a stingy display about fall/autumn in Seoul with what looked like shredded paper and coloured paper leaves. I payed to see an exhibition on a Korean writing system party out of embarrassment for the museum and a desire not not leave the building.",Negative,0.906,Positive

625,5.0,We came here to have a stroll at night and this place was simply beautiful. There were loads of food trucks if you want to have some street food. The LED roses also made the place even more beautiful. Good for a night stroll and some picture taking at night.,Positive,0.9058,Positive
626,5.0,it's an architectural master piece in my eyes. Never seen something like this anywhere. I love the night market and truck food. LED rose lights at night makes it charming enough. Head to 'Dongdaemun history and cultural park' station for direct access.  'Dongdaemun' station is next station and you might need to walk back to reach there.  Outside of DDP there are lots of shop and the famous Migilore and Doosan shops. Eat n shop,Positive,0.79,Positive
627,3.0,"The Dongdaemun design plaza is a beautiful structure. You can find here a few big fashion musea with a few big event halls, although I never had the luck to visit anyone of them. Everytime I visit the place (about every couple of months) there are no events. The design plaza is a good place to relax in a quiet place, away from the buzz outside in the many fashion shopping malls right beside.",Negative,0.7202,Positive
628,4.0,You don't see this type of building in your day to day life. A moden marvel of architecture. A place where people who love archetecture can enjoy. (my kids were not interested though),Positive,0.8378,Positive
629,5.0,this place is very big and so many tourist. its not even a problem here. maybe because its near to shopping mall and food truck outside. we bought some souvenir at the road down there. and the street food look really tempting. yall really should try that.,Positive,0.3089,Positive
630,5.0,"What started as an attempt to see the flowery lights that we only see in kdrama's . I was surprised to find that on the Saturday night that there will be loads of food trucks lines up in the vicinity of the DDP. Boy the choices was good... looking the portion of some of the order it was also quite filling and not to forget smells soo delicious. We just had dinner , therefor was too full .. But we did share a churros , which was awesome!! Crunchy on the outside with a soft chew fluffy insides .  Besides foodtrucks, there were selfmade artist selling their arts and also a blowup balloon arts that was everywhere .. a very good night out and loads of photo Opp's.!! Do checkout this is on the weekend. The night life from cheonggyecheon river to the malls opposite the DDP seems like its always busy with something during Saturday late evening to night... =)  TIPS: for those who doesnt have much time to spare in korea.. these places are all within walking distance to checkout - Cheonggyecheon River end - Grill Fish street - Dongdaemun Shopping Malls -Multiple BIngsu places -multiple Train stations nearby - if you come in the morning even have a historical landmark too""forgotten the name"". sorry... but the DDP is quite central easy to make it a landmark ""In-Case-Of-Lost"" among a big group.. =). ENjoy!!",Positive,0.9891,Positive
631,4.0,"Dongdaemun is a pretty interesting place, with its countless street markets and architectural design, but it's nothing really more than a few photo ops, here or there. I do visit Dongdaemun frequently, to clear the head after a heavy night out, but there really isn't anything you would write home about. If you are into photography, it is a fantastic place to practice your depth of fields and length snapping, but it's nothing compared to the palaces you have on offer a mear 3 or 4 stops away in Jonggak or City hall. I suggest visiting only if you have bags of time and you are passing Dongdaemun on the subway.",Positive,0.8847,Positive
632,4.0,"If you are into Architecture, you must visit Dongdaemun Design Plaza. I went here with great expectations and totally amazed with the building - although I am not a fans of zaha hadid style of Architecture. The building itself is breathtaking, because of its enormous size, and also because the architecture is so unusual. The building features a shapely facade made up of aluminium panels.  One of a must visit place in Seoul.",Positive,0.8908,Positive
