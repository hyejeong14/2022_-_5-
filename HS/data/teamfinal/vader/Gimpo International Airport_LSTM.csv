29,3.0,"The airport and staff were, for the most part, above board. Gate seating was fair and I personally liked that trash receptacles were separated into recyclable and non-recyclable materials. But I was concerned with the time it took for check in staff at The China Southern desk to find the necessary Visa information to let us board. I admit I had to bite my tongue when we were given information that we knew was patently incorrect with such confidence. I had to insist that they check again and it took two staff members at least ten minutes before they realized what we had been saying all along. The only small stain on an otherwise wonderful trip to an amazing city.",Negative,0.9659,Positive
