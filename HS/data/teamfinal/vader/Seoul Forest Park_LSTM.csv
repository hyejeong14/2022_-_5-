The weather is cool so it is more pleasant to walk around.The forest is easy to reach by the Seoul subway. At the Seoul Forest station, use the lift near Exit 3 to reach the ground level. Turn right and then left into Under Stand Avenue. I spent some hours in the forest, exploring the various parts. From the entrance, I kept to the right of the forest as the trees on that side were particularly colorful.The weather was cold, so the bird corner at the far right was empty. Then I turned back to the rear of the forest where the Ginkgo Road, under the afternoon sun, was absolutely absorbing. From there I passed under two bridges on my right to reach the Deer Corner (with spotted deer). Later I returned to the entrance, passing by the lake.

We brought along a frisbee and inflatable ball, and had a great time playing together. There were also cafes and restaurants nearby and we had lunch there. We walked to the Deer enclosure to view the deers, but the feed for the animals were already sold out by the time we reach (around 3pm). Nonetheless, we had a great day at Seoul Forest and it is a great place for a family outing.",Positive,0.975,Positive

Lots of paths to walk on and spaces to rest in the shade. There are plenty of benches, picnic tables and common sitting areas. Many people were also enjoying their picnic on the grass. A nice place for a family day or just for anyone who wishes to be in the nature in the midst of the city. With all the different trees, I think it will be lovely there in the fall.",Positive,0.9579,Positive

From the Seoul Forest metro station, there is a lift that takes you to the ground level. From the lift exit turn right and then left into the "" Under Stand Avenue"", a short street with shops built from metal containers. If you are hungry there is a noodle shop with reasonable prices.

I can only imagine how much more wonderful it would be in the warmer months. With all of the activity in a busy city like Seoul, this park offers a moment to walk, talk, think, and rest before heading of to the next activity. In winter, go at least to take a walk.

There is also an impressive schedule of concerts and performances to see at various venues throughout the park if you like to plan in advance.

The forest is more of a park than a forest but still was well worth visiting. We spent most of an afternoon here, walking the park and discovering hidden areas (small animal area, deer retreat, children's park, statue park, etc). The cafe overlooking the lake with fountains was peaceful and we happily sat with a drink and ice cream here for over an hour. We found somewhere to rent bikes by the hour (all sizes, and tandems!) for a reasonable price, and although we didn't use the facilities there were tennis and badminton courts.

We always pedal to the deer park to feed the deers who will basically licked the feed off your palm. Just be careful as there's a gentle slope on the final stretch near the deer park as it's quite crowded. Remember the brake when going down the slope.

Directly in front of the exit is a row of green and white bikes which you can rent. You do not need to be a citizen of Korea to use the system, and all of them have baskets and gears.

There's a deer food machine just a wee bit away from the deer park. The deer looked much bigger than expected and be wary of the aggressive ones which are all too happy to grab the paper cup from your hands whilst you are feeding them.  There are different parks within Seoul Forest so we then headed towards the open area where people were sitting on picnic mats and enjoying themselves. There's eateries at a mall near the skating park at Gate 3 so if you haven't bought anything to eat with you, you can head there.

NOTE : when we were there last Dec, there was a major construction going on in the front of the park..

Make sure you have enough time for the nice scenery, playground and to visit the deers.. the deers are at the far end of the park from the Train Station.. so factor in the timing needed to walk there...  There is also a playground in the park where my son had great fun..  All in, this is a very nice place to relax and see some lovely deers..

407,4.0,This is a pretty good sized park which is great for families to take their children to. During the summer kids can get wet in the fountains as they shoot up and come down at various moments. Take them to the large playground with two long slides that they would love. You can find a lot of bike paths for couples and parents to ride along or you can play catch on of the two big areas of grass (one path is even lined with apple trees!).There are plenty of places to relax and many people even bring their tents. If you get bored you can see some unique modern art on the grass or check out the fish and waterfowl in the lake as well. The only downside is that it's a very popular place and it gets very crowded on weekends.,Positive,0.9622,Positive
408,4.0,"It's a lovely park either to walk or to cycle. It's less crowded on week days. If cycling, you can get there via the cycling path along the Han River and through an underpass (it's indicated although a bit hidden). There are several attractions: the deer enclosure is probably the most popular among visitors. But there's also an insectarium and a butterfly conservatory, as well as a convenience store, tennis courts, playgrounds and lots of green areas for picnicking. The forest is public and admission is free.",Positive,0.909,Positive
409,4.0,This is a lovely park to walk around in. The playgrounds are fun. There is a little stream to walk in to cool off. The only thing is we went on a Monday and a lot of the attractions were closed like feeding the deer and the butterflies.,Positive,0.9287,Positive
410,5.0,Visited the park few times but the best time to visit (based on my expirience) is during the famous cherry blossom....it was sooo nice there. But the park is really nice to visit all year long :),Positive,0.9595,Positive
411,5.0,We cycled here via Hangang. The place is so pretty with cherry blossom petals falling from their trees. Sadly the ecological forest is only open in summer and winter so we didn't get to see the deers. Great place for strolling and cycling. There is also an inline skating rink.,Positive,0.7019,Positive
412,5.0,It was awesome! Great place to cool off in the fountains and walk in the shaded areas... The butterflies were magnificent!!! In love with the forest!!,Positive,0.9673,Positive
413,3.0,I would say this is an average park. It is nice for a stroll. There are bunnies & deer in a caged area to feed. Feed is available from a vending machine for a fee. A nice size pond is on site for beautiful views. There are a few different playgrounds if you have children. There is also a butterfly garden on site. Over all I would say this is a nice place for a picnic and to just get out of the house/hotel. a great place to let the kids run and play.  Visited April 2014,Negative,0.9571,Positive
414,4.0,"I've been to the Seoul forest plenty of times. During the different seasons too. Because I come from a tropical climate, the seasonal changes are intriguing to me. The forest is easy to get to, (Seoul forest station) and it is HUGEEEE. There are multiple walking paths you can choose from and there are signs along the way. I usually just walk to the deer enclosure. And then I turn back it's a short route. But plenty of nice views for the eyes.  There isn't much food around. Heck I don't recall seeing any. So be sure to get some snacks and water from the convenient store at the train station before heading into the forest.  Also the forest is actually a FOREST. It's near the road so you can hear cars passing by. And there are concrete walking paths and a lot of bathrooms.",Positive,0.8409,Positive
415,3.0,"We found it to be rather average. It was nice, but nothing out of the ordinary. If you are nearby, it's a nice park to go relax and walk around. However, we found nothing special to warrant the travel time to get to it if you're a bit further away.",Negative,0.7624,Positive
416,5.0,"It's pretty small, but there's lots of little things to do, like a splash zone and outside exercise machines. This would be a great place for a family with young kids because there's an awesome park (see attached photo for one part of it). It's also just a nice place to go if you want a relaxing place for a picnic. There's low-to-the-ground wooden tables that are great to sit on and stop for a bite. Overall, a very well-designed, small park if you want to relax for a few hours during your vacation.",Positive,0.9884,Positive
417,1.0,"Yes it's has nature and would be a good visit during spring and autumn. But let's face it: highly overrated. Good for a simple sit out but nothing that special or not even lots of nature around, unlike even central park in new York.",Negative,0.6346,Positive
418,3.0,It was not like a forest. Just a park. But you can rent bicycles and ride along the river banks of Hangang River.,Negative,-0.1419,Negative
419,4.0,"We dscovered Seoul Forest about 6 years ago when our children were quite young and it has remained a firm summer favourite. There is plenty to keep kids busy for a few hours from climbing frames and slides, feeding of the deer, followed by a cool off in the play fountains (don't forget your bathers). Now that our kids are getting bigger, we take bikes and cycle from the park to the river. There are toilets and fast food. The car park can get full quickly so be prepared to queue.",Positive,0.7611,Positive
420,5.0,"We went here in November so the surroundings are orange-gi. A perfect place to rest and avoid the city noise. It's kinda big and you need hours..... We had a lot of pictures here.  I love nature, so I really enjoyed a lot. I want to visit the forest again in Spring and see the beauty of ""green"" Seoul Forest. There is a little flower garden which the flowers are in full bloom of yellow and purple.  A perfect place to relax and have a walk with your friends, family or with your someone special. One of the places that I would really love to visit again.",Positive,0.9856,Positive
421,4.0,"This place is my favorite place to relax in Seoul. With a big patch of green you can lie down on the grass and chill out kids play on bikes and families have fun. It's also large enough that it's not often overcrowded. The other attractions aren't all that like the butterfly garden. Don't come for that. Bring a ball or badminton rackets, your favorite book and chill out here.",Positive,0.9359,Positive
422,4.0,"I visited the forest, which is really more of a park, with my girlfriend on an overcast, autumn/fall afternoon. We had a walk around in the cool weather and loved it. The colours were amazing. The forest also has an insect house, filled with butterflies, other exotic insects, some peculiar-looking fish, as well as a few large tortoises. Overall, despite the oft-termed 'miserable' weather, we really enjoyed it for the purpose it served: a peaceful, quiet experience. They forest also has deer which you are allowed to feed with park-sanctioned food from a dispenser.",Positive,0.9577,Positive
423,4.0,"the place I like best is the playground where the very long slide is installed. Many kids line up to go down the slide and it's really fun and exciting. After you have fun at this playground with your kids, you go to the wide lawn for eating your lunchbox. And then you look around the forest. If you want to participate in activity performed in the park, you can book it via seoul forest website in advance. It's going to be fun and a good memory for your kids.",Positive,0.9754,Positive
424,3.0,"Seoul Forest is a nice park in the center of Seoul, with a nice environment. The park is big enough to make you forget that you're in the city. Nice playground for kids. However, although clean overall, it wasn't as maintained as other parks I visited. Also lacked cafes, restaurants shops or other ""great"" attractions to make this a ""must-go"" destination. I'd recommend visiting Seoul Dream Forest instead.",Negative,0.9382,Positive
425,3.0,I had a free morning before meetings and decided to check out Seoul Forest. It recevied great reviews and seemed promising. It was a let down. Perhaps it wasn't the right time of year (I visited in mid-October). It didn't seem that well taken care of. There were some flower beds still in bloom. I didn't think it was particularly that big after being told it would take a 1/2 day to do. Perhaps if you do all the extra stuff such as the butterfly garden and children's activities. I went early in the morning before10am so none of the buildings were open yet. It is easy to find. Take the B (orange line) to the Seoul Forest stop. Follow the signs in the metro for the Seoul Forest exit (Exit 3). When you come up from the metro just walk straight a block and you'll see a giant white sign for Seoul Forest.  If you have free time and want to wonder around a bit outdoors it's not a bad place however don't expect to escape the hustle and bustle noises of Seoul. The park is surronded by busy roadways so you'll still hear traffic all throughout the park. Maybe wear your headphones with some nature sounds to really try to escape.  Hope the summer time would be a better experience.,Negative,0.9698,Positive
426,5.0,"This would be an excellent place for kids to hang out. Playgrounds and ecoforest where they get to feed the deers. Excellent weather for visit in autumn. Free entrance and children can easily spend half a day without getting bored.  The train station ""Seoul Forest"", on the Bundang line, is the nearest station to this place. Once out of the station, turn right and walk ahead. For some reason, this is not showing on Google map. This 5 min walk away from Seoul Forest, compared to the recommended Ttukseom station, which is a 15 min walk away.",Positive,0.9404,Positive
427,4.0,"Location: easily reach by bus or underground. (center part of Seoul, beside the Han River) Good Complex: with children facilities, jogging paths, wetland, animals and biking paths beside the Han River. There are also some cafe and convenient store in the park.",Positive,0.6597,Positive
428,4.0,"Seoul forest is like an oasis in the city. It is a nice place to walk around and relax, but nothing much to do around there. If you are with your date or family, that is a nice place, but not for casual tourism. They have some playgrounds as well.",Positive,0.8427,Positive
429,5.0,"This place is really peaceful especially on weekdays because not to many people come here on weekdays so this place is not really crowded.  Also, you can have a picnic which suitable not only for a couple but also family or friends. Don't worry about the space to have a picnic because this place is quite big so you can choose where to have picnic either.  If you like to take photos, then you come to the right place because the scenery here is really amazing. Come in wrong season? Don't worry... There are still a lot of spots with great views that are not related with the season, such as the stream, pond, etc.  So, take a visit to this place will be a right decision if you want to have a picnic or just have a city escape with your partners.",Positive,0.9732,Positive
430,5.0,"We spent a full day at the Seoul forest. There is so much to do for children from play area to cycling to feeding the deer, rabbit,Guinea pigs, fishes. Spread across a huge area so be prepared for lots of walking. Not many food options so bring your picnic basket. Sculpture park is interesting and the huge playground is lovely to laze.",Positive,0.9284,Positive
431,4.0,"The Seoul Forest is easy to go to - I took the line 2 train, went down at Wangsimni station and changed to the Bundang line. The Seoul Forest station was 1 station away.  It's a very good place for walking and spring blooms-hunting. When I came mid-April, most of the cherry blossoms already fell off the ground but there were other nice spring blooms in the forest.",Positive,0.7748,Positive
432,4.0,"We came to the forest and rented some bikes for the afternoon. It was fun to bike around and see the forest, lake and statues. It is quite far from the city center, we took the subway there then a taxi. There are playgrounds for children and it is surprising change from the rest of the loud, crowded city. There are lots of areas for picnics or just quietly relaxing.",Positive,0.8225,Positive
433,4.0,"I am so glad I found out about Seoul Forest. It's a big place with lots of things to do even in winter. There are 5 different parks. There is an enclosure for deers and they will come to the edge of the fence to eat from your hand. (There is a machine near the enclosure where food for the deer can be purchased.) There is a place where they displayed insects, an echo forest and most important lots of place for the children to run and enjoy the fresh air. As we were there in winter some of their attraction was not open like the splash fountain but my children still had lots of fun building snowman, sledding and having snowball fights. Coming from a tropical urban city, this was definitely one of the highlights of the trip.  The great thing is it is really convenient to get there. Take the subway to Ttukseom station (line 2). Exit via exit 8 and walk about 15 minutes. There are even directions in English. Another great thing - it's free!",Positive,0.9841,Positive
434,5.0,"I am amazed that i am the first one to comment on this hidden jewel, yeah maybe its a little far from seoul but it was a perfect place to get away. Ride the yellow line train and its clearly marked to get to the Seoul Forest. The landscaping is really good and there are many things to see and do inside the forest. You can rent a bike, there is a butterfly area where you can actually go inside and the live butterflies are fluttering all around.. its free?? Great place to take pictures, if you are into flowers then you should go during the spring and summer but i prefer the fall when the mosquitoes are under control. There are clear maps to see and there are certain sections of the park labled so you can choose your interest. There is a place that you can buy food to feed the deer.. great chance for kids to see and feed the deer and they are always hungry. There is a bridge section that allows you to walk from the park all the way to the Han River. Its a great place to grab an ice cream and walk around with friends or families. Plan on spending some time just to go to every part of the park and you can even continue on and walk around the Han River. Good place to picnic and take pictures. The best part is... its free??? Enjoy",Positive,0.9977,Positive
