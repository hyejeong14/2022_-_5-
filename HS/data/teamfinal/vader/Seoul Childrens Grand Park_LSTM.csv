282,3.0,"Great place to let children run and play. Zoo is very depressing and deteriorating. I wouldn’t take kids to see the zoo. I saw many parents throwing stuff at the animals, and by all means, don’t let your children be unattended here I was holding my baby and two adults rushed to get a picture of a monkey, pushing me aside, and standing in front of my child. I’ll never forget it. The chimp was amazing, the adults were animals.The place is safe, but so crowded and old men and women will shove children.  The land is great, a piece of nature set in the city. Beautiful nature and weekdays are less crowded. Weekends from spring to fall are rough; religious groups and summer camps occupy most of the land, but there are quiet places if you search.  I’ve seen elderly men and women knocking squirrel nests out of trees to forage for acorns. Now there are signs informing people not to steal acorns. There’s annoying music playing all over the park, so you can’t escape Kpop even in nature.  The best thing about this place is the amphitheater. Great live performances. I highly recommend. But, sometimes there are very young girls (age 8-15) dressed like prostitutes twerking to Kpop on stage and it was SO awkward. .... especially as tons of old guys filmed it.... yeah, maybe grandparents, but I saw a lot of guys wandering by to film. Was so weird.  Convenience stores are here so you’ll have places to buy water or snacks.  There’s an ancient amusement park with rides that look like they’re from 1962, so ride at your own risk. I like the amusement park, but again, stay close to your kids and as always, prepare to be racially mocked, disrespected, or abused.  Enjoy this beautiful park. Avoid the morbid zoo.",Negative,0.9928,Positive
283,5.0,"The park is attractive to both adults and children in autumn (late Oct./ early Nov.). The autumn colours are fascinating but they vary from year to year depending on weather, etc. This year, the summer is long and dry but the ginkgo and maple trees still show off their beautiful autumn colours, although not as good as those of last year. The park has a good zoo, apart from an amusement park, etc. I like to go there (and to the Seoul Grand Park) when I visit Seoul, as both are great places for photography and leisure.",Positive,0.9661,Positive

285,4.0,"We went with our 20month old toddler and really enjoyed the whole day there. It's a huge park with outdoor and indoor playground. Probably because we went on a weekday, the whole park was very quiet. Entrance to the main park is free, but certain attractions charge a fee. Key highlights 1) best thing about this place is the Seoul Children's Museum. There's an entrance fee but it's not expensive. They also allow u to exit and re-enter on the same day. There are 4 storeys catering to different children age groups and the set up on each floor is very impressive, especially the water play on level 3! I think it's fun for all kids from toddlers to teens. 2) catch the animal show called Anistory featuring many types of animals including seals, birds, cats, monkey etc. Need to pay for entry though. It's quite entertaining. Even though we didn't understand the language, we still enjoyed it very much. 3) the park is massive, great if u like outdoor walks. There's a huge water fountain show near the Seoul Children's Museum that's quite impressive too.  Overall a nice destination that offers both indoor and outdoor experiences. I didn't like the mini zoo though. Each enclosure was very small and the animals looked a bit depressed. I wouldn't recommend if your only objective is to visit the zoo.",Positive,0.9959,Positive
286,3.0,"This place is a hidden gem and not many tourists visit this park. Very nice, clean and spacious park with lots to see like gardens, playground & mini-zoo.

288,3.0,"Information found online about the Children’s Grand Park can sometimes be sketchy and inconsistent.  I hope that the following will provide a better picture for those planning to visit the park. I have also attached a picture of the park map that I will refer to below.  The park can be accessible by 2 subway stations.  The main gate (#1 on map) is accessible easily by the Children's Grand Park Station on Line 7.  There is a rear gate (#36 on map) that is accessible by the Achasan Station on Line 5.  The park has no entrance fee, except for the amusement park section.  My suggestion is that children below 14 yrs will appreciate the park.  I brought a tween son, and 2 pre-school kids to the park.  All three enjoyed the amusement park (#38 on map), which is closer to the rear gate. The amusement park had rides catering to pre-school kids to tweens. Do note there are some rides that have a 120cm height requirement. Rides such as the Viking, Dropzone and Roller coaster are generally adapted for tweens. For those a little younger, there are bumper cars and spinning saucers that are children friendly. However, this place would not be recommended for toddlers. A cafeteria is found within the amusement park serving traditional Korean foods and burgers. Nothing to shout about but it satisfies the tummy.  Amusement park entrance fees depends on the type of ticket you purchase. Tickets are available in single ride, 5 rides, 10 rides and unlimited rides options.  For the 5 ride option, kids paid 16,000 won. Adults paid 19,000 for the same ticket.  Toddlers and pre-school kids should check out the playground (#12 on map) with wet play and dry obstacle options. Bring your toys for sand play if you wish.  The other attraction we tried was the zoo – a mini zoo at that. We saw an elephant, snakes, birds and baboons. A couple of macaws looked like they were suffering from a disease that caused balding on their body. The kids enjoyed the zoo but soon lost interest in it once they stepped out of the zoo.  Next to the zoo is a pavilion which sells snacks (#34 on map) like ice-cream, corn dogs and cold drinks – a great respite from the heat.  2 attractions that we did not visit – the children’s museum (#46 on map) and Kid’s Auto Park (#44 on map) would probably suit school going kids.  Directions:  For the museum, and auto park, use the main gate.  For the amusement park, use the rear gate.  The zoo is in the middle of the park and are equidistant from either gates.  In summary, this park is accessible by 2 subway lines. It provides a place for kids to be themselves and preserves the sanity of parents who want kids to run wild and not bother them for too much over a couple of hours. School going children will probably benefit the most out of a half day excursion to this park.",Negative,0.9966,Positive

There are nice botanical garden, ponds, outdoor sports complex, too. - The zoo has many kinds of animals. Considering the admission is free, it's really satisfying.

Seoul children are so lucky, to have a lovely and huge playground with a zoo. For adults it is also great to spend some hours walking in the beautiful and tranquil park.

We visited the amusement park and believed due to weekday only 5 rides are opened and both my kids are shorter than 120cm, left omly 3 rides to play. You can purchase the rides in 1 ride, 5 rides or day pass. No sharing between kids. Rides that need parents accompanied need extra ticket at adult rate. But the staffs were extremely nice, especially the seniors staffs, they open up rides for my kids and even allow us to join them for free, I'm very very grateful and appreciate for such kind gesture. They have really make my day especially it was raining whole day in Seoul whereby my kids don't have the chance to play the sandy playground. We also catch an animal show despite we don't understand korean, it was very entertaining seeing the animals performing. In the park, you CN also see many elderly exercising, playing with their friends. The park is big and we did not manage to finish as it was raining on and off.

There were 3 levels in the museum and the kids had a lot of fun playing. The staff stamped out hands on the way in so that we could re-enter if we wanted to visit the cafe or restrooms.

Three zebras were kept in an area smaller than most backyards. It was very hot that day and we were saddened to see that few animals had areas to cool off in even a small pool of water. Most of the animals were pacing back and forth in their tiny living spaces, no doubt due to boredom. one of the fox seemed to have an eye infection. The elephant looked so sad and lonely. Some had little shade and no grass.

We ate at the Fried Chicken Restaurant that's located right next to the Anistory.We spent about 20,000 krw for a family of 4.

The rides aren't huge but big enough for kids to enjoy and you can purchase single ride tickets too.  There's a smallish zoo that kids would love.

I saw some young adults throwing food at, not to, thr chimp and baboons. Awful behavior. The chimp enclosure is disgusting. ..the guinea pigs had a better home. Also the big cats and elephant have very small enclosures too. It broke my heart. Many exhibits were closed to prevent the spread of bird flu (so the signs said).

The area was well-taken care of. I felt like I was in a TV show hahaha. Awesome for kids as well. I saw lots of kids having fun by themselves there. Easy access to the subway. Close to Sejong University, where I was staying. Admission was free! I spent a good 2 hours just sightseeing. Great for solo wanderers who wants peace from bricks and skyscrapers. Also safe for female travelers. They even have background music along their alleys. Oddly creative, I must say.",Positive,0.994,Positive
331,5.0,"My 4 year old boy loved it, did not want to leave, and says he wants to fly 8 hours to go back there. Tomorrow.  So the rating I gave here refers purely to the Museum, and not to the park.  This Museum is a very interactive museum designed for young children, probably best for those between 4-7. Spread over 4 floors, to the kids, it will be 99% play and 1% learning. There are explanations in English as well as Korean, but I doubt if the kids are going to read these. Straight to the fun.  We had originally allocated one day to cover both the Children's Grand Park and the Seoul Children's Museum, which share a compound. During winter, half a day in the Park (free admission; pay for specific rides) is sufficient. But as mentioned earlier, half a day for the Museum -- at least to my kid -- was not enough.  To note, there is a small café on the ground floor near the entrance. But to really have a meal, the little mall across the road is probably more suitable.  There is an admission charge to enter this Museum.  For parents and older kids, there isn't much (else) to do.

About 10-15 minute walk from Line 5, Gunja station. Easy to find and most enjoyable. Three hours flew by - and my kids didn't want to leave.

335,5.0,"We stayed nearby the park. I walked to Children's park almost every morning until I checked out to hotel. I couldn't believe my eyes that this park is really huge and grand! To me, it was amazing! I love this park on top of all parks. The feeling was good while walking (really long up and down walk) that you could actually explore many places in it.  There was a cafe that you could get a good souvenir and helped the children from the other side of the world. There was a massive grand orchestral open air hall that I sat there and listened to classical music (scheduled and not open as yet especially in Winter depending on the time schedule).  The breeze was so cool and warm sunshine. The other side has tin man park with all unusual shapes and sizes in forming different art piece for adults and kids. Wings chair, playground and hopping scale towards the dustbins (if you still have kids heart, you know what I'm talking about~ lol). You too can play as it said adults are allow to play. Please read the sign before playing and keep it tidy.  There is a mini zoo but closed during Winter (I was disappointed for not able to visit) and botanica garden. You might want to bring your kids or friends could visit during other season of time. On the other side, there was a huge theater and performance place that only opens at 10am (Korea Time) but I usually take my early walk and I skip this.  Lots of people walking and exercising in this park. You can go to a special training animal place and find out more when they open at 10am. A water park centre is also there too. By, now you will be thinking, are you serious? YES! I wish I could have more time for it! There are pagoda, some resting place, a bridge, many many sculptures and historical monuments, also a garden of nice flowers (Winter no longer can be seen).  Don't miss the Cafe as you can see coffee seed plant at other season. Music pieces too. I love arts, science and music with coffee and you would definitely see my reviews will be based on this.  It was a good experience staying in the neighborhood with nice landlady, good shoe seller (aunty who is dedicated) and lots of food surrounded.

The park offers up-close interaction with horses and a few other animals. The wild animal enclosures were well maintained and my kids had a great time viewing their occupants.

For the museum, it will be worthwhile to go in earlier so that your kids can have more time to explore all the stations. The driving centre was closed when we went there at about 3 pm on a Saturday.  There is a lack of restaurants around so it will be good to pre pack some food in case your kids are hungry. The only food place we can get is the small cafeteria at the museum.

341,4.0,"I currently live as an expat right beside the Children's Grand Park. I walk through it everyday. This park is huge (3 km around) as it used to be an 18 hole golf course. One reason to visit the park is just to sit, relax, enjoy the sites (zoo, gardens, amusement park, exercise stations are good to see too), but also, it's a great place to see how regular Seoul families enjoy their day off. The kids are adorable, the parents are attentive and the older crowd seem busy staying in shape. If you can catch a lawn bowling tournament or a badminton game, you're in for a full sight. In July and August you may want to bring bathers or a set of dry clothes for little kids as there's a great stream/water pond to play in near the centre of the park. And don't miss the flowers. The park gardeners have done an excellent job ensuring there's always something in bloom. Spring is especially pretty in cherry blossom season.

Area is quite large and you can rent strollers at the park for us$3 a day which is good value. Food outlets also on sight. Worth a visit to entertain younger kids for a day. Minus 1 star as the location is a bit far from the city centre - about 30-45min taxi ride depending on traffic (costs about us$15 in orange taxi).

The female lion was the only one and she looked so depressed. The elephant had nothing to play with and was alone. It just rocked back and fourth. The red foxes looked mangey and malnourished.

Glad we did as it was a pleasant day out with the family. I didn't have high expectations for a free park but this exceeded my expectations. the zoo was a nice touch. The zoo had a children's zoo area with barnyard type animals and then there was also the larger African animals as well. There is an amusement park within the park which we did not try since my children are too small but that area is at a cost which is to be expected.  One thing that was not so good was that there seemed to be many many children on school trip excursions to the park and while the small children were not a problem the older children (~15ish) were running amok on the smaller kids playgrounds which made looking after toddlers all the more important. Also the park is huge so plan how to return home before you go otherwise you'll have to backtrack to the entrance in which you came as we had to do.

We took line 5 on the metro which takes you to the back gate of the park, but it's still an impressive entrance gate. There were fountains by the entrance, and then more in the middle of the park which are what my daughter loved most (and she got drenched, so a change of clothing may have been a good idea). There are also several play areas, most of which are sandy, so appropriate beach-type footwear would have been better than the shoes she went in, but we'll know for next time  She didn't really like the zoo area much, and the animal enclosures did look quite small which I often think is quite sad for the animals, so I was quite glad she didn't want to spend too long in that part.  We went on a Friday afternoon and the park was quite busy with groups of school children. There were also quite a number of people who had taken picnics, and pop-up tents to shield themselves from the very bright sun (we weren't very well prepared as I thought it was going to be a cloudy day and hadn't expected it to be so hot).  We only went into 1 toilet block and ended up using the disabled toilet which had the type of toilet in that we're more used to - the toilets in the ladies were ""squat"" style, which I don't like and I knew would it would be disastrous to try to get my 5-year old to use one of them!!!!",Positive,0.9449,Positive

You can feed the goats, ponies and other tamed animals. You can buy the feed from cute little vending machines at 1,000 won or bring your own lettuce, carrots and chopped apples. There were many animals to view and interesting sections like the children's zoo and animals school.

It's a wonderful place to have a picnic, take your family, or have a date. You can buy some snacks there or bring your own food.

I had more fun watching people feed the animals with the packets of pellets available from the vending machine.

The Zoo is pretty good, some animals i wish that they had more space to run around and a little cleaner place to live but they do have a good variety of wildlife. There is a nice botanical garden and the grounds are really kept well.

Upon entrance, we were greeted by the awesome autumn scenery with colorful orange, yellow and red leaves on the tall trees. The junk art caught our eyes along the way to the mini zoo.

The cages as well below par, tiny, dirty and the animals have lost their will to live. They all look depressed an unhealthy.

There's an adventure land with lots of play structures, a zoo, botanical garden, pony, donkey and camel rides, an amusement park, a marine animal exhibit, an animal show, and many more. We ate at the botanical garden cafeteria. My son and I had pasta carbonara for 6000 won each and it was delicious. My husband had a burger which was actually two smaller patties side by side, I believe his was about 7000 won for the burger, fries and drink, he said it was good, but he was not as ecstatic over his meal as I was about mine. I was just happy that they had pasta which is one of the few things my 3 year old will eat. There were many family mart vendors around so finding a drink when you needed one was easy. The restrooms were very clean and always nearby. We went to the amusement park and opted for single ride tickets, 3000 won for each ride for our son, and 4000 won for each ride for us, we only rode a few rides. My husband and I took turns on the roller coaster which was really fun. And our son rode the kiddie truck ride and the carousel. You can also buy a combo ticket for 5 rides, I believe it was 12000 won for children and 15000 for adults. Or you could buy a ride all day bracelet which I believe was 20000 and 25000 for children and adults, but those prices may not be exact. Our most favorite part of the park was the polar bears in the marine exhibit, they swim right up to the glass and being that close to such a huge animal is amazing. Also, we really enjoyed the camel ride. I rode with our 3 year old son and it was 8000 for the two of us. Our son rode a donkey by himself for 3000 won, and a gentleman led the donkey around and held onto our son to be sure he stayed on. We also went to the animal show called Anistory. It is a cross between an animal show and the cinderella story. It was 8000 for each my husband and I, and our son was free. So it cost us 16000 won to see, and although it was entertaining I didn't feel that the show was worth that much. If you go to the Seoul Zoo you should see the dolphin show, very entertaining and only 2000 won per person. We only saw one souvenir shop but didn't find anything we wanted to buy.
