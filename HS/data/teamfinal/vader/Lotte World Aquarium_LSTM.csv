The aquarium was located at the other side of the Lotte mall. The aquarium was new and well space out onto two floors. As with all aquariums around the world, you get to see almost the same typical species of marine animals on display. However, they have the beluga whale that is our first seeing it up close in an aquarium. Interesting! You can also ""bottle"" feed the fishes on the second floor which is our first too. My boys had a fun times feeding the fishes through bottles. Is definitely a memorable experience for them.",Positive,0.8565,Positive

Good educational fun for all ages and it's wheelchair and stroller friendly.",Positive,0.9042,Positive
270,3.0,"This is a popular aquarium in Lotte World. We weren't impressed. But, it's good to visit with kids once.  - It is 10~15 min walk from Lotte World Mall Entrance. Not that close. - Entrance fee is quite expensive. There are various discount rules by the way. Some of them will be available for foreigners too. Check the website before purchasing tickets. - We waited 20~30 min to buy the ticket. I was disappointed because we didn't have many people before us and their kind work is not that quick. - It was very crowded on weekday afternoon. We waited for our turn to see tanks mostly. I don't know how it's going to be worse on weekend. - The inside was dark. Not easy to get good photos. - They allow big strollers and it was pretty annoying for others. Sometimes those are risky when people don't notice in a dark area. - This is very ENTERTAINMENT friendly aquarium. They seemed take much efforts to attract family visitors. As well as watching and touching, they have various experience programs like scuba diving. If you are more leaning on underwater sanctuary, you'll probably be disappointed seeing fishes and marine creatures looping in relatively small tanks for them. - Unlike other common aquariums having the souvenir shops at the end, they have so many shops and food stalls on the way. - They don't have giant sharks like above three meter long. Instead, they have penguins, otters, sealions, etc. Belluga whales are the highlight of this aquarium. - The scale is smaller than we thought. It will take 1~2 hours if you don't staty long at each tank.",Negative,0.9768,Positive

276,3.0,"Its a nice place. Located at the basement of Lotte Mall, it shows some of the wildlife found in Korea. What interest me the most was to see the Beluga Whale. Gentle and playful creatures. The Spider Crab was another species that surprised me.  Have you seen the Flashlight Fish? Small fish that actually lights up in the dark? You can see it here.  Highlight would be the full screen aquarium. It is smaller than the one in Singapore but still gives a sense of foreboding as you watch the sea creatures.  Probably due to the amount of space, the aquarium makes full use of what they have.  To get here... Jamsil Station. Go to Lotte Mall.",Negative,0.8079,Positive

I TOTALLY enjoyed myself and would say this is in fact the highlight of my entire Korea visit. I was there primarily to see the Beluga and it certainly didn’t disappoint. The Beluga seems trained to swim near to the side of the tank so it was really easy to take pictures/videos of them. Besides, I also enjoyed looking at the collection of strange frogs and extra large river fish, which I haven’t come across in other aquariums so far.

There were lots of varieties of fish to see. The jellyfish section was closed though... not sure if it costs extra or just really closed on the day I visted. I appreciated that the aquariums were huge and can be seen at various angles like tunnels or different sides of the tanks. I just feel bad that all were enclosed...

The y also hold educational sessions on a fair few of them the sea lion were definitely the pick for us and some small sharks as well.

294,5.0,It was so nice and beautiful to see the variety of sea life. I most enjoyed the Beluga exhibition and the feeding of the fish with bottles.

Some of the exhibits are not opened yet during our visit. I paid about 59,000 won for 3 pax if I didn't remember wrongly (1 adult, 1 youth and 1 kid below 6). There are a lot to see and I would recommend to anyone who love marine life and families with kids. I find that it is small compared to COEX Aquarium. We took about 90 minutes to cover the whole place but we didn't manage to catch any shows as it was late afternoon by the time we reached the place.",Positive,0.7935,Positive
309,5.0,"It's something you wouldn't expect from a shopping mall. As you go further in, you'll discover a whole new world. There were four adults and five children in our group, and all of us enjoyed our trip there. The huge tank and the varieties of species, there's lots to see and fun things to explore. It's definitely worth a visit!",Positive,0.9151,Positive
310,5.0,"This aquarium is huge and nice. If you're planning to go to Lotte World, be sure to keep your ticket because there's a discount for your entrance fee to this aquarium. The water system was so good that it's water is crystal clear. A lot of rare fishes could be find here. I've been loving the very huge tank with its super thick glass. Be sure to catch the feeding time for fishes too. One could actually spend 1-2hrs here in the aquarium as it is huge.",Positive,0.9787,Positive
311,4.0,"it is inside a shopping mall and boy, the place is so huge that my feet were aching from all the walking. The area was well-kept and the marine animals look so happy!  the star of the aquarium was dugong and they were seen playing happily with balls and swimming around the huge tank. they appeared to be smiling and at times, they are seen swimming near to the visitors posing for photo taking  there are also quite a few backdrops for visitors to take photos, e.g. since i went during autumn and close to halloween, there is a backdrop that decorated with halloween pictures and items and another backdrop we saw is decorated with autumn related items. i think it is a wonderful idea. i saw many families with kids & couples are posing with the beautiful decorated backdrops.  there is also a small section for kids or anyone to do a touch/free of the starfish or other small marine creatures and dont worry about getting your hands dirty as there are washing basins with soaps right next to it!  as compared to S.E.A. aquarium that we have in Singapore Sentosa, i think this Lotte World Aquarium is much more fun. or maybe it's just me.. :)  There is also ample of space that is friendly for strollers, families and couples..  i would definitely recommend this place to my friends",Positive,0.991,Positive
312,3.0,"Went there on a Saturday. The mall was packed and so was the aquarium. I have been to many around the world, nothing there I haven't seen before but it was nice to see Beluga whales. It's pretty big considering it is inside a mall.",Negative,0.8402,Positive
313,3.0,"For the prices, we were expecting a great aquarium. I may have been spoiled by the ones in Cinncinatti OH, and New Orleans, La, but this one missed the mark. Pretty standard and nothing special. We were kinda shocked when we got to the end and even the kids asked if that was the whole thing. Took maybe 30 minutes to get through and we paid almost 90 bucks.",Negative,-0.0894,Negative
314,4.0,"You would not expect an aquarium within a shopping complex, but here it is: Lotte World Aquarium. Not as big as the Atlanta Aquarium, but still, the size of the tanks are impressive. Like the design that we can go through and see the tanks from below or the other side. The variety of the species are also quite good. Feeding the gold fish with baby bottles is lots of fun.",Positive,0.9548,Positive
315,3.0,"If you don't have much to do, and are trying to kill 1-2 hours, this is a decent aquarium to attend. I might be biased, as the Osaka and Atlanta aquarium have set me with high standards. BUT, I do believe that this aquarium (compared to some of the best in the world) is sort of expensive, for what it has to offer. I believe that I either paid the same or more, to attend this aquarium, compared to top-rated aquariums, like the ones in Osaka, Japan and Atlanta, GA (USA). That being said, the animals/mammals that they have inside the aquarium seem to be well fed and have enough room to get around. If you go on the weekend, plan for it to be packed, as it was for our last trip. My family and I have went during the week, and there was no line to feed the fish or do anything other ""extra"" activities within the aquarium. Plan for a 10-20 minute wait on the weekends for those activities. All of this being said, this aquarium is NOT BAD, it's just sort of pricey, for what it has to offer. I recommend going here at least once, whether you're on vacation, or just trying to kill time. If you drive to Lotte World mall, you get a discount for the parking (if you attend the aquarium), so keep your receipt, as the parking is the most expensive as I've ever seen.",Negative,0.7775,Positive
316,4.0,"There are still a number of interesting displays. A room of jellyfish, a huge tank with lots of fish, two beluga whales, a spot for kids to touch fish and other small water creatures, baby otters, an alligator, and a few other tanks with different fish. It was a great way to spend several hours in the afternoon. The great thing is it's in Lottes' World Mall, which has tonnes of other things to do, so the Aquarium can be a one thing in a full day of stuff, all in the same location.",Positive,0.926,Positive
317,3.0,"What can I say. I've been to much bigger and much more interesting Aquariums in the world. This one has a few interesting exhibits, the usual seal show, and two small beluga whales. It's a nice place for little kids, so they not get overwhelmed. I was done within an hour and would not go back.  But this is a small part of a massive underground shopping / recreation area (underneath the new skyscraper tower that's almost finished). So you have other things to do in the vicinity, and the ticket seems to be valid for the Lottery Amusement Park (connected by an underground passage). So not entirely a lost day...",Negative,0.8816,Positive
318,4.0,"This is one of the best aquariums I've seen in Korea. They have an assortment of many types of fish to see. The aquariums are also well sized for the fish to swim around in and to view. The highlight is the hugs 2 story glass window where you feel as though you are in the ocean itself. Its amazing to see so many fish in one tank. There is also a little play area for small children to make things. It was really nice to have an arts and crafts place for kids as well as a feeding area where kids can feed fish. The only bottleneck is the Whale aquarium where its hard to see anything when its crowded and there is only one entrance and exit. Aside from that, its nice to spend a few hours there on a hot summer day. When you finish, you have the whole mall to peruse. I recommend it especially if you have children.",Positive,0.9781,Positive
319,4.0,"Lotte World Aquarium is not as big as I have expected it to be. There are 3 shows - the penguin show, the seal and I forgot what the other show was. I was a good show but a bit disappointed because the hosts speaks in Korean. It would have been better if the hosts speaks in English as this is one of Seouls tourist attraction.",Positive,0.6858,Positive
320,4.0,This aquarium is very large with many many different fishes and other water animals. It looks well kept and also that the species are being well treated.

321,4.0,It is small aquarium suitable for children.  my children like the dolphin show.  but all shows are in korean.,Positive,0.1901,Positive
322,4.0,"Had a chance to visit this place with friends. It is a new and very logically build aquarium, with different areas devoted to interesting places worldwide. The main attraction is big aquarium with two white whales. If this is a feeding time for specific fish, you can buy prepared food and make your own performance))  If you are in Lotte World Adventure center or go shopping around with kids, it is very nice stop over.",Positive,0.9461,Positive
323,4.0,"We went with the family and my kids loved it, they were very amused seen all different kinds of fishes. For me, just missed the sharks, they don't have them, but they have a couple of big whales. You can spend there like a couple of hours there and it was not crowded when we visited the place",Positive,0.7308,Positive
324,5.0,"Walking though the aquarium was fun for all the family. It isn't cheap to get in, but it was worth the money and got the audio guide to complement the trip.  This is a great way to spend a decent amount of time with the family. My young one was gawking at walking under neath some portions of the aquarium and trying to get the seal to play with him through the glass.  There were fish and species I have never seen at other aquariums. A few of the seals had sense of humors and would play along with children movements swimming up to kids and following their hands around like a large shadow. There is so much information that if you want to read and learn about all of it please block of a decent amount of time. I would say three hours would be minimum.",Positive,0.9714,Positive
325,1.0,"We arrived aroun on Valentine’s Day at noon and were finished around 2pm. We payed 29,000KRW or about $24 for two hours! The shows occur around 11:00am and then again 4pm. We figured we would get our hands stamped and check out the Lotte Duty Free and Mall (My wife’s idea lol) and then return to see the Sea Lion and Beluga Whales’ show. To our profound amazement, they wouldn’t stamp our hand so we could return. They spoke decent English for purchasing tickets and for renting the audio guide but all of the sudden, the English proficient customer help didn’t speak a word of English as I tried to get our hands stamped to return. All they could say was they are sorry. Even with listening to the audio guide, the entire trip lasted 2 hours including multiple trips to the restroom by 4 people in a family, snacks such as a pretty decent churro etc… Had we not purchased the rental audio guides, the entire aquarium could be seen in under an hour as it is very tiny. One would think they would give the audio guide for free with the 29,000KRW price but then the audio guide rental is another 3,000KRW a person. Unlike the museums we’ve encountered with children and great teacher supervision, here parents let their children run wild here and even try to push you out of the way to let their children get a view. I could understand a child trying to get a good view and pushing, not having common sense or decency, but a parent pushing you out of the way? That was ridiculous and I surely told the parents to have some civility. What a waste of money and time with the Lotte World Aquarium. If you are considering or contemplating spending your hard earned money on Lotte World Aquarium I strongly advise you spend your money elsewhere and avoid the frustrations my family felt visiting the poorly run Lotte World Aquarium.",Negative,0.9652,Positive

328,4.0,"This is attached to the enormous Lotte World complex. Looks very new. Prices are about $25 per person. Lots to see and great for a family outing. It is small compared to large parks like Sea World in the US, but I think very comparable to the other aquariums in Seoul. Expect to see everything in 60-90 mins if you don't catch the shows around mid day and early afternoon. This location has beluga whales, penguins, sea lions, many different fish, hands on area and activity areas for small children. Very large single tank that is about 20-30 feet tall and over 100 feet long. Several tunnels for visitors to pass through tanks and be surrounded by the aquatic life. I recommend it, especially if you have small kids and visit in the morning to catch the shows.",Positive,0.7615,Positive
329,3.0,"We had expected much from this new Aquarium, but, it seems that it was designed by someone who hadn't designed or experienced the top Aquariums in the world, which bring fun, and, sensory-enhancing experiences, and, which are educational, interactive, and, family-oriented, This Lotte Aquarium is somewhat educational, but, it wasn't cohesive, and, even shabby.  1.5 hour was sufficient, and, we felt we were at a “temporary” exhibits, although every feture was permanent. The best part was the staff at the ticketing area, who are many times friendlier and cheerful than other Lotte employees throughout the 2-3 buildings, where their staff are alarmingly indifferent, lazy, and below-average in work ethics, due to the discouraging fact that the locals and the government did not support this new development but criticized them heavily when they first opened in 2014. Since the ground breaking day, Lotte have had nothing but the series of serious environmental issues, construction-related accidents, and, customer injuries, and the luxury item stores premature shutdowns due to mis-targeting consumer groups, and, the worsened public transport access discouraged anyone to go there for shopping. I tend to think this might be the embarrassing example of the poor-sighted development by a 2nd class developer, with the rushed oversighted process. Well, the Aquarium program is also a typical example to me.  Compared to top-notched Ripley's Aquarium in Toronto (AA), or, solid ancient Boston Aquarium (A), it wasn't even B-, it is at best C+. They need to reprogram the routes around the gigantic water tanks, and bring more interactive fun, starting with music and light effect for the visitors.  The Entrance fee was steep at 29,000 won ($25). Not a good value for the visit. They open late till 10pm. If you were disappointed, I suggest exploring the new Lotte World Tower Mall (Aquarium in B1 level). It has lots of late night dinner places at the upper levels that you will experience the good authentic Korean dishes and snacks on 5th floor. They close at around 11:30~12pm.",Negative,-0.5282,Negative
