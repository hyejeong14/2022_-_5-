18,3,I have to be a little honest here when I came first time to South Korea and went to the Aquarium in Coex I was fascinated and I really loved it BUT it was my first time visiting an Aquarium After that I had the opportunity to visit the one in Berlin and then another one in Spain Now coming back in 2022 10 years later I found it to be overpriced for what it is offering It is a nice place clean and well maintained However in 10 years I hardly see any improvement this probably depends on the fact that this Aquarium is located in a Shopping Mall If you havent been to any Aquarium  you will love it otherwise you could find yourself feeling a little bit disappointed,4 weeks ago
19,5,Very pretty place,4 weeks ago
20,5,The aquarium is awesome Maybe this is my first visit I really liked it I felt like I was underwater The aquarium is divided into 6 rooms The Legacy of the Inca Empire; Forests and lands of the Amazon; Inhabitants of the World Ocean; Open pool; Sea Predators; Secrets of the deep sea At the beginning you can take a brochure and as you pass through each hall you put stamps Perhaps it is interesting for children But I went with pleasure looked and put seals  as a keepsake You can also do a peeling massage on your hands fish A must visit,4 weeks ago

27,4,The tunnel under the water with the sharks swimming around wasnt as nice was the one in Guam There was a decent variety of aquatics and I keep getting the vibes that place was geared for kids with the Octonauts Cartoon theme throughout  There are seats for rest in a few areas One hour here is enough unless you stop to watch all the exhibits,a month ago

52,5,It is quite interesting to get to know marine life let alone packaged in a certain theme or form such as places to eat traditional houses and so on The location is located inside a mall and has several objects that can spoil our eyes If you want to visit it is better to make a booking in advance to speed up entry to the area usually given a handtag before entering by the officer Lets be adventurous,3 months ago

56,1,Might be a good place for kids if you want your kids to grow up with terrible morals and no respect for animals and life Came here in December of 2021 thinking COEX aquarium was a major tourist destination but was immensely disappointed when I saw 20 clown fish in a 20 gallon fish tank To add to it there were about 20 OTHER fish living in the tank There were no plants no anemones for the clown fish to live in AND it was the first tank on display  There were two manatees A dangerously endangered species literally in a tank not even two manatees long No plants Cruelty  Visit COEX aquarium to experience cruelty at its maximum potential,3 months ago
57,3,The price is cosmic and he himself is small There is something to compare therefore for such a price they should at least show a show there At the exit there is a store with all sorts of toys at somewhat inflated prices to provide a tantrum for children who want everything at once,3 months ago
