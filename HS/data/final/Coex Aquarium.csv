8,5.0,Really nice aquarium for kids and adults We went on a Saturday in the summer and it was packed there were so many people We managed to get around fine though There were a ton of really great exhibits they have a huge shark tank seals manatees penguins and other various animal life My son loved an exhibit where you stick your hand in and little fish eat at the dead skin on your hand He thought this was the coolest thing ever It was clean and there were clean toilets throughout to stop at The price was decent and what I expected for something in the Coex mall It was a good thing to do with kids

18,3.0,I have to be a little honest here when I came first time to South Korea and went to the Aquarium in Coex I was fascinated and I really loved it BUT it was my first time visiting an Aquarium After that I had the opportunity to visit the one in Berlin and then another one in Spain Now coming back in 2022 10 years later I found it to be overpriced for what it is offering It is a nice place clean and well maintained However in 10 years I hardly see any improvement this probably depends on the fact that this Aquarium is located in a Shopping Mall If you havent been to any Aquarium  you will love it otherwise you could find yourself feeling a little bit disappointed
19,5.0,Very pretty place
20,5.0,The aquarium is awesome Maybe this is my first visit I really liked it I felt like I was underwater The aquarium is divided into 6 rooms The Legacy of the Inca Empire; Forests and lands of the Amazon; Inhabitants of the World Ocean; Open pool; Sea Predators; Secrets of the deep sea At the beginning you can take a brochure and as you pass through each hall you put stamps Perhaps it is interesting for children But I went with pleasure looked and put seals  as a keepsake You can also do a peeling massage on your hands fish A must visit

23,5.0,My kids were very happy we visited

25,5.0,Very pleasantly surprised Its a lot bigger on the inside than I expected it to be and it even had a few non aquatic animals I will say few of the fish did seem a bit ill and some of the tanks could be bigger
26,5.0,Nice experience
27,4.0,The tunnel under the water with the sharks swimming around wasnt as nice was the one in Guam There was a decent variety of aquatics and I keep getting the vibes that place was geared for kids with the Octonauts Cartoon theme throughout  There are seats for rest in a few areas One hour here is enough unless you stop to watch all the exhibits

49,5.0,This place never dissapoint
50,5.0,amazing place
51,5.0,Lovely place The best when visiting with kids
52,5.0,It is quite interesting to get to know marine life let alone packaged in a certain theme or form such as places to eat traditional houses and so on The location is located inside a mall and has several objects that can spoil our eyes If you want to visit it is better to make a booking in advance to speed up entry to the area usually given a handtag before entering by the officer Lets be adventurous
53,5.0,One of the best and most atypical I have visited The price on site is 32000 won I advise you to take it on the internet or on a tourist app to buy it You save a great deal As for the visit great diversity immersion and many surprises Good visit
54,5.0,Great for family days or simply to visit and enjoy the atmosphere Lots of seating areas feeding times and a fun passport stamp booklet for children
55,4.0,Nicely set up
56,1.0,Might be a good place for kids if you want your kids to grow up with terrible morals and no respect for animals and life Came here in December of 2021 thinking COEX aquarium was a major tourist destination but was immensely disappointed when I saw 20 clown fish in a 20 gallon fish tank To add to it there were about 20 OTHER fish living in the tank There were no plants no anemones for the clown fish to live in AND it was the first tank on display  There were two manatees A dangerously endangered species literally in a tank not even two manatees long No plants Cruelty  Visit COEX aquarium to experience cruelty at its maximum potential
57,3.0,The price is cosmic and he himself is small There is something to compare therefore for such a price they should at least show a show there At the exit there is a store with all sorts of toys at somewhat inflated prices to provide a tantrum for children who want everything at once
58,5.0,Had an amazing time at the CoEx Aquarium
59,5.0,Best aquariums with all kinds of aquatic animals

81,5.0,Recommend it especially if you dont have such a place in your own country

89,5.0,best tour point in the seoul this have many beautiful photo spot

101,5.0,Awesome aquarium with a mix of BIG and little marine life There are a few cute spots to take pictures at and stamps to fill out your brochure as you go along the path Sadly I traveled without my boyfriend this timeso I was lonely at the places couples could take pictures at  I would definitely recommend this for children too It seems like a very educational place with the kids in mind My favorite place was seeing the sharks and stingrays near the underwater tunnels You can get really nice pictures there  I would definitely like to come back with my boyfriend
102,5.0,The best aquarium They had every sea creature including otters beavers penguins and another animal with dog in it I forgot  Walking in a hallway with a tank around you Can feed animals and all types of fish Family friendly date friendly and just hanging out friendly Cool for the Coex mall around it too
103,5.0,A five star experience  this aquarium is much more colorful and unique than other aquariums we have visited without being cheesy or over the top  We enjoyed seeing the colorful displays and different types of fish
104,5.0,Nice place for a family vacation on weekend have a big varieties of fishes too which is unexpected for aquarium under a mall
105,1.0,I do not know what I expected but certainly I did not expect crammed species in tiny fishtanks showing no respect for life I felt as if I was at one of those retaurants where you choose the fish you want them to cook for you
106,5.0,Nice experiencelooks like you are in sea
107,3.0,It feels expensive but it can be said that the scale is large I buy the idea of putting fish in various containers but I feel a little pity I would like to say that if we could increase the number of contact corners and shows it would be a step up
108,5.0,Nice place Killer sharks are amazing
109,5.0,class

115,5.0,Pretty nice atmosphere A lot of fishes and other sea animals You can also participate many programs It was quite exciting Nice cafe and cute dolls I bought one from here and my girl friend was quite satisfying One of the best aquarium ever i have visited If you like sea environment i strongly recommend Perfect place for your date as well
116,5.0,Nice
117,4.0,Mainly for kids or newbies Considering what aquariums are like in other countries a bit small and cozy Not aimed to impress with huge fishes but has some a few spots with good configuration to take pictures in and around Near the end of the course there are cute little penguins which are fed at 330 So preferably start the tour at around 245 and take seats before the penguins around 15 minutes before the show Of course the seat availability depends on the number of visitors which you need to take into account so as to watch penguins eating comfortably on the chair Have a nice tour
118,5.0,Nice place special for kids
119,5.0,Its giid to be here
120,5.0,It is located inside the complex of COEX There are so many exotic marine animals inside the aquarium You will feel like you are surrounded by marine life when you visit this place If you are interested in marine life you will enjoy visiting this place
121,3.0,For kids
122,1.0,"This aquarium improperly houses many of its inhabitants and creatures. Multiple loaches available for ""hands-on"" entertainment were dead or dying from being mishandled by so many young children to the point where I saw a couple turning their bellies up and bleeding from their gills in the water. There were no employees watching over the area either to keep an eye on the fish.  I've seen healthier loaches available for purchase at fish markets in Seoul. Not only does this seem despicably cruel, it seems unsanitary, especially for the young children who like to visit. I understand in Korea we have different ethics and views on the treatment of animals, but these aren't even for consumption. They're there for mediocre and grotesque entertainment. Had a child dropped a fish onto a floor and left it there without their parent intervening, that fish would have remained there for who knows how long.  The aquarium itself is sparse with few attractions, most of them jam-packed with fish to the point where calling them overcrowded in a single tank is an understatement. Many of these fish are subjected to bright and whimsical but very fish-unfriendly tank designs such as doll houses, furniture, and outdoor fixtures that they are housed in. They aren't treated as specimens to maintain, but attractions to spice up and add flare to.  The larger animals do not fare much better. Quite a few reviews mention this, but the manatees, seals, and other macrofauna are visibly housed in extremely small enclosures. I do not know if they have larger back tanks, but given the way the fish tanks are kept, I don't have high hopes.  The actual Coex building is charming, spacious, and has many wonderful attractions and food joints to visit. But please, if you walk by this aquarium, walk past it."
123,5.0,"You can meet various fish and animals that live in water here. In addition, you can see performances in the water and participate in various programs such as feeding experiences. So make sure to take a camera or cell phone that you can take pictures with. Discount events are always under way for many people, so it is effective to check the website and visit there. There is also a parking space, so you can go without any burden. There was a souvenir shop, so I could come back home with good memories."
124,5.0,They are so many unique fishes and entertaining shows. You can buy cute soft toys as a souvenir when you leave the place
125,1.0,"Wasn’t aware that they had manatees before my visit. Manatees, seals and penguins all in VERY depressing enclosures. The manatee tank was completely bare and far too small for these animals. I found it quite upsetting and left swiftly after seeing these poor animals. Better conditions needed, this is the 21st century - have some compassion."
126,3.0,I’ve been to many aquariums and thought this one was just okay. There were many families with small children and they were having a great time. There’s a lot of activities for kids . Interactive stations were cool. I went with my grown son and he didn’t enjoy it much. Definitely visit if you have small children. There’s a good variety of marine life. The layout of the place was great.
127,4.0,"We have a fantastic 'ocean world' in my home city, one of the best I've ever seen but this aquarium blew me away. It's huge and there's different themed areas as you go along. It's nicely set up and they had sealife that I had never seen in my life. I got a ticket online at Klook, which saved me about 20-25%. You can also get a flyer at the mall with a 15% discount coupon. The feedings are done by divers. The mermaid show I really wanted to see and waited around for an hour or so was a dissapointment...the 'mermaids' only swam up and down two or three times and then turnes into humans because that was their wish...I also didn't like the touching lab as I saw kids grabbingfish, starfish, poking them and taking them out and throwing them back in, no supervision. Other than that, great aquarium!!!"
128,3.0,Tickets are over priced. Will not visit again. They had a decent variety of Marine life on display. Perhaps good to bring kids there.
129,5.0,"Not a fan of aquariums but this one was really great! Huge variety of amazing fish is never seen before, very curious and strange aquatic creatures. Huge tanks so lots of room to see and makes me feel at least a little bit better about the fish being kept captive. It’s got a lot of crazy stuff to see and the price is worth it."
130,5.0,"Bought 4 tickets to coex aquarium via Klook and it cost us approx SGD$25 per pax...with the experience! Many interesting sea creatures (penguins, sharks, walruses etc). especially love their interactive stations where they allow u to touch the sea creatures (eg starfish, clams, fishes). They even have a fish spa area! Very suitable for families with children:) My elderly parents loved it too! Totally worth the trip ❤️ the layout of the whole area is v well thought out. Foreigners also get to experience a free hanbok experience:)"
131,4.0,"First time to see piranha.Had an awesome time in COEX. The aquarium is just beautiful and highly recommended if you coming with your kids. Educational yet fun. The only feedback from me, all the show were in Korean language which for a foreigner like us could not understand. Other than that everything was good. Another spot to visit if you’re coming to Korea."
132,2.0,"After reading the reviews on tripadvisor, we were quite excited to go here. However, it just felt over priced.  The whole theme is Octonauts, a kids tv show, so clearly it was aimed towards really young children. The fish habitats include the octonauts toys.  Having been to many aquariums, the fish here just look quite miserable. Many of them felt lifeless and it's unclear if it's due to their environment being intruded by the colourful toys. The manatee aquarium especially looked too small for the beautiful creatures, who were staying at the bottom and could barely float vertically without having to bend. Too many tanks that were just too small.  The place seemed to be centered around what kids want. It's bright and colourful. The baby shark song was playing throughout and almost drove me insane.  The area for Doctor Fish to bite at your skin is not monitored. A kid put her whole hand in and started swishing the water violently. The touch pool was also not monitored. Kids could just lift up and throw the creatures without any care for the guidelines stated. More thought should be put into this.  Feeding sessions are turned into ways to educate kids about the wildlife, which i thought was done very well. The amazonian wildlife area was also well constructed that i was amazed. Many of the fish were bigger than the ones i have seen in other places, which is also good. My favourite parts were the pairie dog enclosure, which is ironic since it is not a sea creature. The stamp collecting thing they have is pretty cool too, since i am a teenager and still willing to run around collecting them.  Overall, the priority here seems to be the kids. However, the welfare of the animals should not be compromised in trying to do so. It felt a little sad to look at some of them. Aesthetic should always take a backseat when animals are involved."
133,5.0,"The Aquarium is great for all ages. If you are there at the right time, there is shark feeding at 1:30pm and feeding for other select tanks at 3:30pm. They are very efficient and effective with the use they have and some of the smaller aquarium tanks are artistic design and fun for all ages. There is also one are where kids can tough sea creatures and one tank you can put your hands in and the fish will nibble the dead skin off. The Aquarium is a good size and there is one place in there halfway through if you have a hankering for a snack or some ice cream. There are many places outside the aquarium where you can eat before or after. There is a fun stamp book for kids as they go through to find stamps along the way."
134,5.0,"I make it a point to see this aquarium every time I visit Seoul. Many varieties and I like their collection of exotic shrimps. A must-see in Seoul. Great for children and adults. I usually schedule to see it when the weather is not good for outdoor photography. Easily accessible by subway and is close to the Bongeunsa Temple too. The COEX has a spectacular book library on the ground floor, so next time when you visit the aquarium, visit also the library and the nearby temple. This year they have a chipmunk, in addition to prairie dogs."
135,5.0,Really nice aquarium . a nice place. had a lot of activities around it to. a must visit place and you will not be dissappointed.
136,5.0,The fun is in the inner areas. Navigate to see crabs and otters inside. They're amazingly huge and colourful.
137,5.0,"The visit to the COEX Aquarium in this Seoul tour has become a very good gift for me. I didn't think of any variety of marine life in Korea, and the various sea kingdoms I experienced in Korea became unforgettable memories."
138,5.0,"I paid full price for ticket 28,000 not realising there is online discount I would have paid less. It wasn’t originally on my plan of places to go but a rainy day brought me to Coex. The aquarium is really great with lots of varieties of fish I have never seen before being from Europe. It’s really kid friendly and you can learn a lot from the signs that are in korean and english! Really enjoyed it as a solo traveler."
139,5.0,"My family very love this place!! It's very beautiful, especially the Mermaid Show was really amazing !"
140,3.0,"Don't get me wrong - if you have kids, it's a great interactive activity. As adults, having seen other aquariums, this is average. The exhibits are catering for children, so instead of trying to replicate natural habitats in the tanks, a lot have childish toys in them like a kids gold fish bowl. The aquarium does cover a range of different environments in the world - there's an Amazon rain forest including large otters. A desert area with phararie dogs. A section with manatees & then penguins. The viewing tunnel with sharks & rays doesn't have the larger species, but there is some impressive sharks. Overall, a good few hours if rainng or for the kids. Not the cheapest option so use your Discover Seoul pass to pay."
141,5.0,"My daughter soo happy in here. Many fish, and interactive features inside... for tourist, you can wear hanbok for free every weekdays, and take photo for free... First , i guess the aquarium was small.. but when you entered all the corner, i think this aquarium is quiet big. If you have family to travel with... you should go to this place. Take subway to Bongeunsa Station. And follow the path to COEX Aquarium."
142,4.0,"Nice place for a rainy day. Very cool sea animals. Cost 28,000 each. If you have kids they will enjoy"
143,5.0,"Went on a rainy day and it was super fun :) a huge variety of fish and small animals, a very well designed halls ( great to take pictures ) Worth it"
144,1.0,"This is an overly commercial exploitation of living animals. We have visited many aquariums in the world and this one was one of the worst, the tanks were way too small for the animals within them, especially the larger animals like manatees, crocodile, and the larger fish that were swimming around the tank in circles, bumping into the glass walls and clearly very uncomfortable with the small size of the tank.  There was a section where you could handle and touch sea creatures, and within this section, were dozens of tanks and no staff around, with little children poking and squeezing the creatures continually, whilst the parents sat on phones. The entire aquarium is overcrowded with tourists too, many of them are very pushy and disrespectful and will literally push you out of the way to get themselves in the front of the glass, there is no information about conservation or how to protect these animals, the place was very clearly set up to be a commercial hub.  Just please dont do it, it is heartbreaking to see the animals trapped in such small and overcrowded tanks. AVOID"
145,4.0,The aquarium is pretty good with an assortment of displays and some unique creatures. It’s not unlike other good and modern aquariums around the world. It is a great change of pace from temples and palaces if you want to get out of the heat with kids.
146,3.0,"Just like other reviews here, the reason why we went to this aquarium is to fill out the use of our Discover Seoul Pass. The entrance fee to Coex is on the high side and will easily justify the cost of the Discover Pass. This is one of two aquariums that is available for entry by the Discover Pass, and this is one is much better, as the other one felt more like an oversized aqua pet shop.  Some displays are in ponds, some are in big tanks, but a lot are in aquarium tanks sizes. However, the aquarium tanks are big for a lot of the fishes, so these provide great viewing opportunities. The fish spa experience allows one to feel the doctor fish nibble on your hand.  The coex mall has also been upgraded, as compared to the last time I went here a long time ago,"
147,4.0,"We went to Coex aquarium because it is part of the Discover Seoul Pass and we can enter for free if we bought the pass. We were really not interested in going to the aquarium at first as we have been to a lot of big aquariums, so we were not expecting something great from an aquarium in a mall. Please note that I am an avid Aquarist and I love to visit public aquariums, my kids also love them as well.  When we got there though we were happily surprised, the aquarium was well presented, the layout was nice and the exhibits were well kept. I think there was some confusion about the two types of Arawanas though, as they bunched both the asian ones and the amazon ones in the same area.  They also had a few Mammals on exhibit, the Prairie dogs and the African Manatees were really cute, and we were lucky that we were there during feeding time. Penguins were also nice as well.  The kids loved the experience of the Garra Rufa or Fish spa fish, after they were asked to wash their hands and then put them in the tank with the fish, the kids stayed there for maybe 10minutes.  If I were to give improvement suggestions to the aquarium, I would say, put more explanation on all the exhibits, environment, diet, conservation status, etc. and also make sure english translation is accurate.  I can say that the exhibits is comparable to the Ocean Park aquarium in Manila, except that they do not have the outdoor shows, which is fine by me.  One new thing that the kids learned at the aquarium is how to determine if a shark is male or female!  I would say that we all loved the ""Nursery"" where we saw baby seahorses and pregnant male seahorses, the Axolotl is also a favorite of my kids.  I would highly recommend going to this Aquarium if you love fishes."
148,4.0,Big Aquarium inside the COEX Mall. Well maintained with lots of sea creatures to see. the main attractions were the diving penguins and the Piranha fish! very informative and a good place to go to if you'd want to rest from the humid weather outside esp.during Summer Months in Seoul (June)
149,3.0,"This aquarium is nothing special at all. Do not expect to be wowed by anything unique or creative. Unless you have never been to an aquarium or have children that demand you take them there, do not waste your time and skip this activity. There are better things to do in Seoul."
150,5.0,"A really fun and visually impressive aquarium. The layout and design of each area is well thought out. Multiple observation rooms give great opportunities to see a large number of unique, beautiful fishies and other animals! Add this place to your ""must see"" list if you are in the area."
151,5.0,"One of the best things about Coex Aquarium according to our 3 years old girl are the Octonauts. She was more impressed with a room where she could push a button and start the song, than with all the sharks, fish, turtles and other amazing beings. It was also interesting to see the feeding. And the navigation system with stamping was also nice. Overall we had a great time there. Maybe would like to have a bit more buttons and Octonauts around. That was the girl’s opinion."
152,5.0,My husband and I decided to visit the Coex Aquarium when we were in Coex mall and it was one of the highlights of our trip to Seoul! You can see many different interesting sea animals! Highly recommended!
153,4.0,Good Aquarium in the COEX shopping mall如果可以多點介紹部份或互動部份更好。例如短片介紹或iPad 遊戲等。 希望下次可以見到鯊魚位置表演 或其他關於魚類嘅介紹節目。
154,3.0,Not a lot of information on display. Might be better for kids. Not really somewhere you NEED to go to when in Seoul.
155,3.0,"They have quite a few interesting exhibits that I have not seen in other aquariums but overall, the place is built for kids and the adults might find it boring if they've been to other aquariums."
156,4.0,"Very nice place for everyone interested in nature. Worth to go there especially when the weather is bad :) Staff is nice and helpful, speak in English. I really like part ""Story about Korean fish""!"
157,5.0,Lots of things to see. Nicely decorated. Big and spacious. My kids (8 and 2 years old) enjoyed a lot. There are also some interactive exhibits that you can touch the sea creatures.
158,4.0,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Coex Aquarium - the first aquarium I have ever seen inside of a shopping mall. It was a bit overpriced, even with the tourist discount we got thanks to a travel brochure we picked up at the airport. The displays are quirky and unique, and even boasted some sea life, such as manatees, which we hadn't seen in any of our aquariums back home. Overall, a fun experience and a lovely outing if you have kids or if you are looking for something to do indoors on a very cold and/or rainy day."
159,4.0,"If you like aquariums, it is a must-see in Seoul. I liked to visit the aquarium whilst in Seoul (especially when the weather was bad and the parks were wet). This was my second visit and there was no noticeable change. However, watching the various creatures in the aquarium was quite relaxing and entertaining. This time, I tried to refine my camera skills for shooting tropical fishes; the results were not bad."
160,4.0,"The aquarium is huge, and many interesting exhibits suitable for a trip with kids. The place is also quite spacious and not crowded on weekdays."
161,3.0,"The COEX Aquarium in Gangnam area of Seoul is one of the largest aquariums in South Korea, it boasts having over 40,000 creatures from over 650 species on display. Its nicely laid out with a well signed route which snakes its way through the various tanks and exhibits, most of the tanks have write ups in English. There are a lot of fun little activities dotted around for younger children to enjoy, although these are more geared to speakers of Korean. Not all the exhibits are aqautic, I walked around one corner to find a rabbit!! Highlights - The under ""sea"" tunnel, the jellyfish tanks and the otters."
162,5.0,Our son loved the aquarium. If you need to spend a day inside this is a great place to do it. There are a ton of people there however so go early.
163,3.0,"We have visited many aquariums around the world and to be honest we found this one quite bizarre - plastic toys and cartoon characters in the fish tanks, video game machines next to the displays, the mermaid/clown fish show, rabbits and prairie dogs, vending machines everywhere so you were constantly trying to avoid bumping into people who were eating and drinking. The otter, beaver and penguin enclosures were really depressing. Having said that it was very busy the day we visited and there were many families with young children who seemed to be enjoying it, but I would find it hard to recommend to anyone else."
164,5.0,"lovely experience ,mesmerising water world, it was indeed a experience to watch the colourful water world at the Coex aquarium, it was convent form the Coex convention centre"
165,4.0,"This is a fun aquarium for young kids. In contrast to the educational scientific approach, this aquarium focuses on being fun and lively. First part of aquarium had ovtonauts related displays, then there is a place where you can touch “doctor fish” and star fish. There is also a shark area and some penguins. It’s a nice place to spend about 90 mins with kids under seven, but not much larger than that."
166,5.0,I have been here three times in four years and all was good. Pros: 1. Nice and clean aquarium. 2. A lot of varieties 3. Nice Ambience. 4. Not tiring 5. Photo areas 6. Nicely instructed 7. Good/Great staffs  Cons 1. Overpriced. I have visited it before and the price was half of it. Suddenly increased the price.
167,5.0,The price is a bit expensive if you're on a a budget but I think it's well worth it. The aquarium is so quirky with some of the displays but also very good at taking care of the animals. There are lots of different exhibits and activities to take part in this place would be especially good of you have children traveling with you as they would in my opinion love it. Plenty of bathrooms and vending machines so was never thirsty or needing the loo. All of the staff that I encountered were very nice too
168,4.0,"The aquarium was definitely better than I thought especially you pay 27,000 Korean won ($25). Well-designed with many different fishes I’ve never seen before. It’s an interactive experience where you can actually touch a few sea creatures. If your kids have never been to an aquarium, this is not a bad choice to make. It was enjoyable."
169,5.0,"Lots to see, very well displayed with lots of information also in English - many creatures that we hadn’t seen before in aquariums in England. Funny that they put fish in random things like a phone box and fridge. Would definitely recommend a visit if you like sea creatures. Loved the otters they were so cute !!"
170,4.0,"Went there at 12pm with a group of young kids over the summer. Just in time to catch the sea animals feeding schedule. There was a small touch pool and also a hand spa from doctor fish. What an experience for the kids! It took us about 3 hours to finish the whole thing as we also took quick snack break. There is a snack café which sells hot dog, sausage, ice cream and drinks. There are many drinks vending machine in the aquarium too.  If you simply want to see some sea marine, the tour usually takes 1-1.5 hours."
171,3.0,"Me and my family likes to visit the aquarium(s) in the towns and countries we are visiting. Coex Aquarium was pretty average when it comes to content, as soon as you ""forget"" or ""scratch out"" the fact that there are plastic toys and lego buildings in some of the tanks for the small fishes.  I had never seen sea-cows in real life, so that was definetly a new one for me!  A big positive was that they seem to keep the tanks clean and also the glasses/windows. If you like aquariums and aren't bothered about a few toys and lego buildings among the fishes, I would recomend this as an activity :)."
172,5.0,"This has got to be the most amazing attraction that I visited while in Seoul. The Aquarium is smartly divided into different sections so visitors (especially children) can learn a lot of things about marine life. It's great for families, friends, and couples too. The best thing about Coex aquarium is that a wide range of species can be found here and they all are displayed creatively. The mermaid show was amazing as well. The whole place is clean and spacious. I would love to visit it again!"
173,5.0,Amazing variety of sea life displayed in most imaginative surroundings like kitchen sinks and fire extinguishers. And why not!! Impressive larger animals like rays were fascinating. This place is more than its location under a super mall promises. The only negative was missing supervision as children were touching some petting animals much more than recommended - parental guidance is obviously not enough...
174,5.0,"The place was surprisingly bigger than I expected and they have a huge variety of species on display. The displays were organized and has a theme which was interesting. There was an experiential part of the aquarium where visitors get a chance to get close and even touch the creatures. However, there was no staff to supervise the visitors. There are also rest areas for families with children and vendo machines to buy refreshments. They also have a scheduled shows.  The place is great for families, couples, and even for solo travellers. There is more to this place than just fish so be sure to visit. It is also very near SM Town musuem."
175,2.0,"Was supposed to be a highlight of our trip to Seoul.  While the whole attraction, as a whole, was really good, the touch pool was appalling. I am all for aquariums allowing their guests to touch the different kinds of sea creatures on display for education but i strongly feel that these interactions must be closely, and strictly, monitored by staff. This was absent at COEX. Kids (I don't blame them, I blame their parents / adult guardians) were squeezing these poor creatures. I am very sure that these creatures were feeling tortured. If there's no staff to supervise, don't open the touching pool.  To further my disappointment, there was a sign saying that feeding for the pirahnas was starting at a certain time but it never happened.  In all honesty, the only positive I took from the visit was that I got to see turtles and a cowfish.  Unless COEX improves their standards, I will never visit the aquarium again."
176,4.0,"Went here on a weekday around 1pm. They have special shows which are usually done in the afternoon starting at 1:30pm. We bought our tickets online via Klook which was about $2 cheaper than buying it in-store.  Overall experience was great, although there were a number of tanks that do not contain the species being described on the signboards.  We spent more than 3 hours there because we tried to watch all the available shows and read almost all descriptions shown on the tanks."
177,5.0,"This was one of the better aquariums we have seen and the exhibits were set up in way which was interesting and fun for young children.  We finished the walk through the exhibits within two hours, but missed the shows which tend to be in the afternoon, particularly over the weekend - there are less shows on weekdays."
178,4.0,"This aquarium is Octonaut-themed, and my boy loves it! There are many different areas, classified based on geographical zones, with petting area to interact with the marine creatures. This place is highly recommended for families with kids."
179,3.0,"We saw great reviews about this Aquarium so stopped by. I guess if you have small kids, it's a great place for them to wander around. If not, well, don't expect Sea World. It's a pretty compact (& a bit handmade) aquarium that is part of the mall."
180,4.0,"It is surprisingly large given that it is situated inside the COEX, an expensive place in the heart of the city. I had visited numerous large aquariums but still managed to find something interesting. There was a locker facility (at a small charge) and that was helpful. The staff were particularly helpful although they did not speak much English."
181,5.0,"Surprised how big this place is once we were inside. Great collections, and children's program. Nice and clean. Enjoyed it."
182,4.0,We didn’t expect much as it was a last minute decision to visit.  It was a weekday so the crowd was few and far in between.  The variety of animal was a surprise. Although it was meant to be an aquarium but we also got to see prairie dogs and beavers.  The sardine show was good and entertaining.  Would recommend if you have a few hours to spare.
183,4.0,"My boyfriend and I went to the COEX aquarium over the weekend and it was one of our best days in Seoul. We spent quite a bit of time here exploring and reading about the many different types of fish and mammals. The draw card for me was the manatee enclosure, you're able to get quite close and observe them. There is a seating area in between the manatee and seal enclosure so you can chill out for a while and watch them. The aquarium also has feeding times, so if you're lucky, you can see your favourite's in action or at least plan around that. All the enclosures are well looked after and the staff are friendly and helpful. I also found the first part of the exhibitions interesting, as it had a full history of Korean fish, which my boyfriend enjoyed a lot too. While they're not as pretty as the tropical fish, they're interesting to learn about. The cost is 28,000KRW each for adults which was worth it in my opinion. To get to COEX Starfield Mall you need to catch line 2 (green line) on the Seoul Metro and disembark at Samseong station. There are many signs in both Korean and English which will guide you to the Aquarium. All in all I definitely recommend this aquarium!"
184,5.0,"My husband and I took our 6 month old baby to the aquarium on a rainy day and had a wonderful time! We were amazed at how beautifully maintained and clean all the tanks in the aquarium are. The animals seem very well taken care of. We especially enjoyed the quirky section of the aquarium where fish are living in all sorts of funny places - a telephone booth, glass lanterns, tupperware inside a refrigerator, etc. It was entertaining for our baby as well as us adults. I would definitely go back!"
185,2.0,looks like the concept has been brought without giving adequate thoughts to make it stand out compared to its peers.  Very expensive to the boot
186,5.0,"This aquarium has the greatest variety of fish I´ve ever seen! It even has penguins! I really liked the theme each room had and you can even touch some of the creatures there, like the starfish. Great for family trips!"
187,3.0,"The aquarium is tucked away in the mall, but easy enough to find with adequate signs pointing the way. It was a bit underwhelming but large enough to keep you entertained for a couple of hours."
188,5.0,I've done some Aquariums but this one is really well-done. There are a lot of animals that I didn't have the chance to see before that day. The visit will take you around 2 or 3 hours. The entrance is around 20 euros but it's totally worth it :)
189,5.0,i was first a little taken-aback by how up close and personal you are with apex predators and the lot... it was absolutely a one of a kind unique experience that none of us will forget! if youre out here for some unholy reason do yourself a favor and dedicate a couple hours here!!!
190,3.0,"It was an ok experience, but way too expensive for what it has to offer. Not impressive and the entrance was around 25000w."
191,4.0,"Many species. Not only under sea habitats. So very interesting, large main pool with big sharks and turtles. Worth it"
192,5.0,"you'd think an aquarium inside the basement of a mall would be lacklustre, but wow you'd be wrong. This place is huge and has so many different areas. You can spend a couple hours in here easily. It has pretty much all the staples of a good aquarium. There's a shark tank, otters, an underwater tunnel, educational things, jelly fish, and some extra trendy stuff. It isn't the best aquarium I've been to by far, but it gets a 5star simply because it was way better than expected. Easily accessible by subway and you can spend a whole day here if you like malls. Watch a movie, eat some food, go to a temple across the street, go to an arcade all on a subway stop. This place is also one stop on bus from the airport for about 15 bucks. So even a great stop over spot when in Korea"
193,4.0,Our family of five had a wonderful time in the Coex Aquarium! Many different areas to explore and Santa was diving with the fish! There were lots of kids and families but never felt too crowded. Lots to see and fun exhibits! There was a food festival on the front of the Coex on this particular year day and we had a great lunch! The Aquarium was the perfect place to get out of the cold!
194,5.0,"Was a great day out with the kids, as shopping mall next door. We spent about 2 hrs there, very easy to get to. Great indoor activity if weather is bad."
195,4.0,"Mixed feelings about aquaria. first of all not all sea creatures are truly beautiful to look at... secondly, similar to zoos it can be somewhat sad to see these animals in small tanks....  That being said, the children loved this aquarium. it builds up well. the start is quite modest and includes some rather weird settings as well as animals (bunnies, ferrets, hamsters/chipmunks). But at any rate they have a full selection ranging from sweet water river fish that are probably more culturally relevant to Koreans all the way to jelly fish, turtles, sharks, eels, moray, sting ray etc.  The beginning of the tour seems to cater to small children with an octonaut theme. Towards the end you're able to see 6+ feet shark, stingray that look like mini-flying-carpets the size of a coffee table..."
196,4.0,Visited this Aquarium alone at Coex mall. Centrally located and provide best view of all varieties of marine life's. Best time to go alone with friends and family members.
197,5.0,"This is the best aquarium I have been so far. The environment is really good, kids have opportunity to touch in some kind of attractions alive, the glasses surrounding the aisle give us an impressive sensation and kids are surprised all the time."
198,4.0,"Been to Seoul a couple of times and this is our first visit to the aquarium. The aquarium is located in coex mall with plenty of shopping and restaurants. The aquarium itself wasn’t big, you can basically cover the whole place in a hour or so. There are some very innovative display of the fishes in this place, eg a water dispenser filled with fishes, a fire extinguisher acts as a fish tank etc. Pretty interesting! The rest are pretty much your usual aquarium stuffs. Go if you are traveling with young kids, they will love the place."
199,1.0,"This Aquarium it's nothing special! It depends a lot on what have you saw before. So, if you have been before in great aquariums forget about this one, it's small and has nothing special to see and it seams that they don't take very well care about the animals there. But if you are with little kids and don't know what to do i thing you can go there and enjoy."
200,4.0,I visited the Coex Aquarium with a friend. There were plenty of different types of fishes and is an interesting place for fish lovers. I’m posting photos to show the fishes.
201,5.0,"This is a must see for visitors to Seoul. Wonderfully laid out, allow time to see all the exhibits. They are diverse, and children are especially catered for with interactive games. One of the best laid out aquariums we have visited. Many species to excite interest with waterfalls and ponds an attractive addition."
202,4.0,"Prefer this aquarium to lotte world aquarium, since it felt as though it was larger and had a larger variety of marine lives. A lot of thinking seemed to have been placed into the designing of the aquarium's layout and furnishing to elude an air of cozy ambiance throughout the visit, even though I felt that some tanks might be too children-friendly for adults - had to squat down at most of the first section. The staff at the ticket counter could have been friendlier as well, as she looked irritated when she found out that I couldn't understand Korean and that she had to repeat herself in another language."
203,5.0,"We visited as part of an organised tour, this is a good little aquarium with fish in a variety of quirky settings. Its well worth a visit and not too expensive."
204,3.0,"The aquarium is located within Coex mall and is designed to be kids friendly. It was interest to see innovative way of displaying the fishes in the aquarium, like retrofitting an old telephone broth into a fish tank."
205,5.0,"Spent 2,5 amazing hours with 4 children aged 2 to 9 in this aquarium! Highly recommend to anyone with and without children"
206,4.0,"This place is much better than the one at the Coex Centre in Seoul. My 7-year-old had a great time there, especially feeding the fish. Really liked the variety of fish and animals. You can buy discounted tickets through Gmarket. You can do the aquarium in the morning and Kidsania in the afternoon if you have enough energy. Kids will have a perfect day."
207,5.0,"I visited this Coex aquarium on the last day at Seoul after attending a conference. After checking out at the hotel, I could take the hand luggage into the aquarium and walk around (that was the reason - to pass time while hanging on to my hand luggage). Within the coex mall the aquarium is nicely planned with lot of species - sharks, penguins, live corals. Full price is high, but you get instant 15% discount with the coupon you find there. I guess the locals get better discounts when they bring their kids. It takes about two hours to see the aquarium leisurely. There are places inside to sit and watch the marine life for longer. It cannot be any better."
208,5.0,"Arrived at coex mall for some shopping and decided to hit the Aquarium first with our 4 year old; she loves sea creatures!  We've been to a fair few aquariums around the world and this one has a really cute and quirky display. We really enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and so did our daughter. The doctor fish part was probably our favourite.  Lots of fresh water sea life from all part of Asia, really interesting to see.  Would definitely visit again"
209,5.0,"My expectations were low for an aquarium in a shopping mall, but the Coex Aquarium houses an incredible variety of animals."
210,4.0,Its a very big aquarium with so many separate sections for fishes and animals. Saw different and unique varieties of fishes and sea creatures. It took 2 hrs approximately for us to finish the tour of aquarium. Overall a good place.
211,4.0,"The best thing about this aquarium is that it's not very big, which is ideal for a little toddler - it's just nice for him and and spent a few hours here. Don't expect to see aquariums like seaworld etc and you'll enjoy it"
212,5.0,"Spent 3 hours here one afternoon. Well worth the price; make sure you take a picture at the poster in the mall for 10% off. It's inside the mall, and a little hard to find, but once inside, it is a blast! So many different fish tanks, and so much to see. The shark tank at the end is amazing, and big enough to really make you feel like you're inside the ocean! Well worth the price."
213,2.0,"I truly enjoyed the aquarium and the way they had some of their displays set up. The only downside for me was that there were several very young school groups who were all yelling and running. They have one spot where they play soothing music and you can fit in front of a massive aquarium where sharks and rays glide by in front of you. It would have been a great spot to sit and video the beautiful creatures but there several groups of very loud teenage Korean boys running through it ruining your video and generally ruining the whole feeling. It would have been an awesome experience if the staff had maintained some kind of order, but most of them appeared to be high school kids themselves."
214,4.0,"We were shopped out since we were staying in Myeongdong and the idea of going to a pricey mall wasn't appealing, but I figured at the very least we should check out the Gangnam neighborhood made famous by the singer Psy and if we got bored we could go to the aquarium.  Firstly, the mall is pretty awesome looking. We didn't see anything extraordinary at the shops but loved the library in the wide open middle space. It was a trek to find the aquarium but we did and passed a sign offering foreign visitors a 10 percent discount if you took a picture of the sign, so we were able to snag a discount to boot. We didn't have the highest of expectations and were pleasantly surprised. We love aquariums and have been to various ones in the US, Sydney, Vancouver, Singapore etc. I wouldn't say this collection was unusual but it was nicely presented including my favorite of a phone booth filled with small fish. They also had transformed other ordinary objects into tiny aquariums. When we arrived we raced to an otter feeding but it was in Korean with no translation so we left after a bit to enjoy wandering around. The aquarium was much larger than we expected and we spent more than an hour there. I also enjoyed the large shark and stingray tank, again not unusual but still cool to see."
215,5.0,"Best aquarium I've ever been to. Not normally one to visit aquariums but we visited after a full day tour of Panjumeon and the DMZ and needed a change of pace.  We only had 90 minutes here as they were closing..easily could have spent more time here.  The themed areas are very cute and I loved their inventive displays - especially the area with fish displayed in phone booths and fridges! Great wee bit where you can lie on a bed and just watch fish. Enjoyed the musical fish who interact with their space creating random notes.  Impressive shark tank, and installations and the English translations of the different fish are very cute. Only down side - some animals need larger enclosures."
216,1.0,"Aquarium is okay, not really spectacular but not bad. It is in my mind a good educational experience for children.  However parents are terrible at controlling their children. People touch the fish in the tanks even though people are prohibited to do so (Korean and Chinese were the only one we saw doing so at that time).  In the Marine Touch Lab it is even worse, there are clear instructions how to behave and what to do. However parents with seriouse dillusions of grandeur, think the animals are indestructable and people just manhandle them.  Here are some suggestions:  *Close off the tanks so people cannot touch the animals. *Discontinue the touch zone because people are re~￦@%d and cannot behave themselves."
217,5.0,We went here July 2016 with our daughter. We love coex and it was beautiful but we do not manage to see the live show.
218,2.0,"My son was utterly disappointed after reaching the site, it's rather small. And compared to other Aquariums in Hong kong, singapore and Thailand it's nothing."
219,4.0,"well designed in the center of an underground mall adjacent to the COEX conference center and the Grand Intercontinental hotel. Rich in items, especially nice for children."
220,5.0,We bought the tickets for 25k each. Well spent. We where in there for about 2-3 hours. There were alot of activities for both adult and children to enjoy. They had a good variety of different fish.
221,5.0,"An educational experience and fun for all ages, well organised and friendly staff, sardine love show is so enchanting."
222,3.0,"We went on a Monday and it wasn't very crowded. The main attraction is the huge aquarium with sharks, manta rays, and turtles which was quite impressive. Everything else felt like it was just filler. Great for small kids though. Lots of activities to keep them engaged.  We paid 50,000 Won for 2 people and I felt for what was offered it was a bit overpriced. Wouldn't go again necessarily, but I didn't regret going in the first place."
223,5.0,There were species we had never seen before and some which we did not expect to see in an Aquarium --lovely collection by any standards and definitely worth the visit
224,4.0,"We went here with our 2 boys, aged 6 & 2.They had a blast looking at all the different fish, stingrays, sharks, turtles and other sea life. They even had some other animals such as Beavers, Otters and Penguins. This aquarium was nicely laid out with 16 different stations. I would allocate around 1-2 hours for this attraction. I think some of the main features of this aquarium are the Huge ""Ocean Kingdom"" with all the sharks, The Fish in Wonderland which show fish in all diferent types of unique aquariums, The Amazonia World which show marine life from The Amazon River and The Marine Touch Lab to where the kids can touch certain marine life. This attraction is stroller friendly. My only drawback would be that this attraction is sort of on the pricey side with adults costing 25,000 each, youths 22,000 and children (3-12) 19,000 krw."
225,5.0,"This was our second visit to the aquarium. Hours of wonder and fun with the fish and other animals, including the otters, beavers, penguins... My teenage son still loved the squirrel most, but we all enjoyed the colours and tranquility of the aquariums. Well worth the visit."
226,4.0,"We enjoyed walking around, learning & viewing. It's a good aquarium, but not great (like Singapore). Loved the quirky house area where marine life were in everyday home areas: bed heads, fridges, kitchen sinks, etc"
227,4.0,"We have been twice. The first time we absolutely loved this aquarium. The second time it was a little different. Zoos and aquariums are always a little sad when looking at how small the enclosures are for the animals/sea creatures. If you are able to look passed this then you will enjoy the aquarium very much, like we did the first time!"
228,4.0,"I enjoyed this place with my wife and we had a fun time checking out the fish and it was a lovely place and when you are done can you eat lunch in Coex. It is not a must see, but fun place if you lived her for a longer time or if you have kids."
229,3.0,This was a nice sized aquarium where you could get close to the fish and exhibits. It would be a great place to go with kids.
230,5.0,"We were pleasantly surprised that Coex Aquarium can rival the SEA Aquarium in Singapore. Considering that Coex Aquarium was inside a mall, we did not expect much. We were pleasantly surprised to see that it was very modern and had as much attractions as SEA Aquarium in Singapore. They even had penguins and huge sharks which my kids really enjoyed watching. And for its price, it was well worth it!"
231,3.0,"Frankly speaking the value for money is not so good in Coex Aquarium. There are not so many animals here, this attraction is more for chldren than for adults even though there were some interesting spots. However I will not recommend a visit to this aquarium and if I could come back to the past I would save 25000 Wons/ticket and skip this attraction. COEX shopping mall itself is not very interesting also, however it is a kind of must-see in Seoul as it is considered to be one of the biggest in the world."
232,5.0,I have been to several aquariums but this is by far the best. Great tour inside plus a show as well!! Nice experience for people of ALL ages!
233,5.0,This is one of the good places to visit with families. You will find various specious of sea fishes and ocean hunters like sharks.
234,3.0,"We love visiting the aquarium at every single city we travel if it has one. Seoul was not an exception and we chose COEX as we were told a lot about it. The entrance was easily found. Staff was friendly. The aquarium seemed to be large and well organized with some areas where guest could play with the fish and ocean creatures. The big fish and penguin, however, looked so tired and boring. Since we were there around 11am with no show at that time so we did not really enjoy it. But I think it could be much better once the renovation is completed."
235,4.0,"This is one of a good places to visit during in Seoul, especially for the aquamarine lovers. This is definitely a cool place with the very nice decorations but a bit expensive. But overall, it's such a lovely place to visit either with family, partner or friends."
236,5.0,This place located within the Coex Center is one of the must-sees in Seoul. They have a vast variety of species exhibited. They provide interactive activities for children. It is amazing how clean and maintained the aquariums are.
237,2.0,"This aquarium caters to families with small children. If this isn't you, go elsewhere. If it is you, you and your children will have a very nice time."
238,5.0,"Coex Aquarium is a combination of Marine Fish & Brackish Water fishes in the Amazon jungle. It highlights fishes in their natural habitats able to live together with other kinds. For the marine fishes, there's a section where children are allowed to handle live corals, starfishes, hernit crabs & even a baby octopus. There is also a tank full of Piranhas looking so aggressive & unfriendly. It usually takes about 90 mins to complete everything. Coming out of the Aquarium, you will be able to buy souvenirs to bring home.Highlight is the feeding times when 4 divers get into the water to hand feed the fishes, octopus, sting ray & mantle ray. They also performed some water aerobics to entertain the audience in the theatre."
239,4.0,"Coex Aquarium is fun and interesting especially for young kids. My daughter is 3.10 years old, thus, still free; payment starts at 4 if I am not mistaken. The map at the start of the ""journey"" makes going around more interesting as one needs to complete the stamp from several stops and get a post card after. There are a lot of variety of sea creatures and they eat healthy foods, fruits and veggies! A nice place to visit and takes around 1-2 hours in total. =)"
240,4.0,"Aquarium is in the Coex Mall. Great use of mirrors makes it look much bigger than it is. Some clever displays such as panels in drink vending machines, in old phone boxes, household items for smaller fish. I spent 2.5hrs there and enjoyed it. Good variety of fish and animals such as otters, prairie dogs, bats and squirrels. Sharks are a decent size as are the rays. The manatees were my favorite though. Compared to other aquariums this is overpriced. It cost 2500 won to enter. A nice way to spend a few hrs.  Accessible from the green line Sameosung station."
241,5.0,"Some people might balk at the price, but it's worth it if you go as a group. It's a very nice aquarium with plenty of English information for visitors. We went as a school trip for students who were mostly English speakers and they really enjoyed it."
242,3.0,"The place is overrun with children and definitely geared towards them in my opinion. We were 3 adults, and we of course still enjoyed all the sea life, but we did not enjoy the crowds. I would avoid weekends if possible."
243,4.0,Enough to see when you want to get out of the cold. There are good signage to each exhibit. Before the entrance and inside there are lockers for storing your bags.
244,4.0,"This is a standard aquarium in that there are lots of tanks of fish. However they had one room laid out with tanks showing what would be from the beginning of the Han river to the sea. It also has what lives in a paddy field. There are unusual fish tanks (one uses a refrigerator ). There were also otters, beers and manatees."
245,4.0,"Good aquarium. Entrance fee is 25,000 KRW. Great location in Gangnam. The one in Busan is probably better"
246,5.0,"This aquarium started out ho-hum...then got interesting! I especially liked the 'Dr Fish' that nibbled my fingers. My kids especially liked the touch-and-feel section as well as the microscopes that magnified tiny aquatic creatures. I'm happy we went. Just outside a metro stop - super easy to access. Part of an underground mall, so plenty of dining and coffee options for before or after."
247,5.0,"This is a nice aquarium with some unique features I hadn't seen previously. We enjoyed the uniquely Korean fish tank displays (in a coke machine, a water cooler, a phone booth, etc.), and the sardine show (where divers divert the schooling fish in various directions) is a spectacle to behold. Among the many exhibits is a big shark tank with some interesting varieties and some of the largest sharks and rays I recall seeing at an aquarium. The ""doctor fish"" (nibbling pedicure fish) exhibit was a fun hands-on experience. Lots to see here, and a great place to spend a few hours with the kids in inclement weather, especially since it's attached to a mall with lots of restaurants. We didn't find it too crowded, especially considering that it was a weekend during the cold winter. Note that the experience is linear, so you'll need to pass through the entire facility to get out."
248,4.0,"This a nice aquarium in the middle of the city and about five minutes from the nearest subway stop. However, it is far too crowded, making it difficult to view the exhibits in a relaxing manner. The exhibits are modern and professional."
249,3.0,"We visited the aquarium due to the bad outdoor weather and we have a couple of hours to kill. This aquarium is like any other aquarium, plenty of tropical species of fish, sharks, rays etc. The layout of the place is more or less similar to other public aquariums, with a tunnel to view the ocean creatures. I have been to better ones in my opinion. A good place to visit if you have time to kill and you have a restless child in tow. Skip this attraction if you have other places to visit."
250,4.0,"I didn't expect a huge Aquarium inside a mall. It looked small when viewed from the entrance, but you'll be surprised how bit it actually is. It had different themes and a good variation of fish and other animals."
251,4.0,"We visited the aquarium at the CoEx Mall one evening before closing. It was over $20 for admission. A little more than expected. We enjoyed our hour going through all the various exhibits. They even had a beaver exhibit with all the different aquatic animal and fish exhibits. There are vary many exhibits and the interesting thing about them is the design of the tanks. For example in one area, there were fish swimming in a kitchen sink. Also, there is a tank where you can put your fingers in and the fish will nibble off your dead skin cells. They didn't seem to interested that evening. Overall, we enjoyed the time we spent here."
252,4.0,"This aquarium leaves a lot to be desired for a city of this size. In my opinion Busan is a much better aquarium. The majority of the exhibit is comprised of indigenous fresh water fish, however they do have a nice selection of sharks (one of which ate another shark in 2015 and can be seen on CNN online)."
253,4.0,"The aquarium was entertaining for the kids. Had a good selection of fish and animals from all over Korea as well as a select few from around the world.  There is a section where they have fish in interesting tanks like vending machines, phone booths refrigerators, etc. that were pretty neat.  Kids enjoyed the interactive touch exhibits and the sharks and rays."
254,3.0,"Just an aquarium with some national Korean touches. It's not the biggest one among the oceanariums I have visited, but it is obvious the object is very well maintained. The entrance fee is a little high for such a place. Good place for educational trips with kids."
255,4.0,"It's a mid range aquarium, not small not that much big, and full of families with kids. Specialy during weekends it's very busy and crowded, but koreans are very quiet and polite.You won't be regretful after spending one or two hours there."
256,2.0,"It's not that it's bad, but don't waste your time in Seoul on this attraction. If you are travelling with children it will be a nice thing to do, but don't expect something special."
257,5.0,The aquarium presents a large and rare variety. The whole arrangement is with due consideration of children. The informative boards are in simple but catchy language to attract the kids. And really the kids enjoy it very much. It has a high educative value and is a 'must visit' place for children.
258,4.0,Their aquarium is pretty huge with huge sea animals too. Great for kids. And nice place to take picture.
259,3.0,We finished seeing everything in less than an hour. It's a very small aquarium and not really worth going to. You're better off just exploring Coex Mall itself.
260,1.0,You can't simply put random fish in random containers and call it an aquarium.  I really wanted to like this place but this place is way too scattered and sparse in its exhibit to be a first class aquarium.
261,4.0,"I found that it is one of the great aquarium (probably the best one) in Korea!! I didn't expect that much, just thought it would be normal one. But it was really nice and I did like it!! A lot kind of fishes and etc..... The best part was the glass tunnel there I felt like I was under the real sea!"
262,5.0,I sow new and wearied kind of fish there. The most amazing view was the shark view. And they were playing music and they put cheers at the back so you can watch it comfortably as long as you want. رأيت هناك انواع غريبة و جديدة من السمك. المنظر الأكثر روعة كان لمنظر القروش من خلف الزجاج على طول اكثر من طابق.
263,4.0,"Visited the Aquarium with a 3 year old and a 7 year old. The Aquarium isn't as grand and spectacular as some other Aquariums in Asia but considering it is right in the city and above a mall, it is not too bad. There are some fun exhibits for children. Some quite interactive, keeping young children busy. Visit for the entertainment aspect of it and yoi won't be disappointed. Expect to spend about 1.5 to 2 hours."
264,3.0,"This Aquarium has some Limited Species of Fishes, it is Not that Attractive and a bit Pricey on the Entry Fee.It might Excite the Kids to see some Fishes, but not worth the Entry fee."
265,2.0,I have been to plenty of aquariums over the world. The one in COEX mall was priced 15000 won back in 2012 and showed nothing much for the entrance fee. I found only the jelly fish section better than the rest. Entirely forgettable experience
266,4.0,I spent about 35 minutes total looking through the aquarium. I think the price reflects the fact that the aquarium is in the middle of a city.
267,3.0,"Not as big and impressive as other aquariums in the world, you can spend some pleasant times to visit."
268,4.0,I recommend a visit to the aquarium expecially with kids of course. It is really amazing and there are also some exibitions during the feeding hours really nice( unfortunately only in korean but it is amazing the same). It is better to get information about the hours when you arrive.
269,5.0,"We were there in Aug. My 11 year old had a blast. You can touch certain fish/starfish and snails. Is not thay big but bigger than you would imagine since it is inside the mall. They have shows, and overall a good experience."
270,4.0,"My four year old and I love going to COEX aquarium. One can easily spend about 3-4 hours in the aquarium. It's not just viewing the lovely displays but also the shows like feeding the Sharks, penguin. You can touch and feel starfish which is fun. I love the display which has the fish that eats your dead skin. There is a innovative section where they have aquariums made with stuff like refrigerator, vending machine etc. definitely worth a trip."
271,5.0,I loved this aquarium! It was lovely with many species of fishes & huge sharks. Its not over crowded & also pretty diverse with other animals other than fishes.
272,5.0,A wonderful place and is located in the center of shops and underground and has many fish and marine life and possible buy toys on the forms of fish
273,5.0,I went with a friend and we both think it is really a nice and particular aquarium! It is really unique and I think it's a good place to spend a day for families with kids!
274,5.0,Family outing in COEX mall would never want to miss out the fun and educational aquarium. Note the feeding timetable for various locations if you like to witness the real time feeding fun.
275,5.0,"on a limited area, they successfully gave us a quick overview on Seoul/korean fishes. Then different sites are there for children to play and a lot of selfie posts for the adults who love it. A great way to organize an aquarium that i have not seen anywhere else, maybe only similar to Singapore.  Dont be surprised, you will also see other animal types and not only fishes. Some are very cute that kept my daughter busy pointing out this and that, saying wow and oaah.  Would recommend this for those travel to Seoul with kids.  ps: prepare walking shoes as Coex Mall is huge and this aquarium is also quite big."
276,3.0,"It is located inside the Coex mall but it is closer to the Bongeunsa station. The aquarium is definitely geared more towards kids. You can stick your hands in one of the tanks where they keep those small fish that munch on your dead skin. The aquarium is not that big, but they have penguins, otters, manatees, sea turtles, beavers, sharks and rabbits (???). It's a nice place to chill on a hot summer day."
277,4.0,"This aquarium starts off like any other aquarium but then you get to the area of tanks that are shaped like a telephone box or fire extinguisher (same size a real one). The are also some rabbits, chipmunks, prairie dogs and Guinea pigs. It was quite crowded so it was difficult to see sometimes. There is a touch pool with some cool things like the sea pineapple and sea slug. There is only a small cafe which sells ice cream and a small selection of drinks inside the aquarium area, but a lot of good places around. Some quite pricey. You can get line number nine right to the door on the subway. Get off at Bongeusa station. This station wasn't on the map I picked up so I guess my map is old. As i didn't know about this station we caught line 7 to Cheongdam and walked down past the temple."
278,5.0,"I've been here twice. I highly recommend avoiding weekends due to wall to wall crowds. Yesterday was a Wednesday and we had a great time. There weren't too many people there. We were able to do the moving tunnel twice. It's popular for a reason. It's a beautiful, creative, innovative aquarium with many artistic and shaped displays. There are lockers to place your backpacks and shopping bags. Inside, there's a snack shop with churros, ice cream, and coffee. There are stamp books for the kids ands touch pool with uniquely korean sea creatures like sea pineapples in the touch pool. Line 9 takes you right to it. Near PF changs. Go in the mall and its to the right. Conan O Brian's pet octopus, Samuel) is in the crab display! ( he is an American TV star)"
279,5.0,"We were very impressed with this attraction overall. Great care and planning, fun design elements and a variety of animals (including native species you'd be unlikely to encounter) made for an informative and entertaining experience. As a pair of adults (no kids) we'd recommend 1.5 - 2 hours for a leisurely encounter. With kids, perhaps adjust time expectations. This being Korea, great selfie opportunities abound and the tanks also lent themselves for some great pix and video to share w/ friends. -- A tip for couples: we went late in the day on a weekday & that cut down on the kid-traffic, making the trip through a peaceful and soothing chance to unwind."
280,5.0,Very nice aquarium with a wide variety of animals. I will post more photos later. Lots of interactive things for children to do to make learning fun. The mall was HUGE. So many stores and places to shop and eat. Really good day but wear your walking shoes!!!!
281,5.0,"great aquarium and it's at the mall!. one of the few places with manatees and you can see them up close.one part even has weird fish tanks like kitchen sinks,telephone booths,washing machines etc.planning on going back"
282,5.0,"This is a great place when you are traveling with kids and they have gotten tired of watching temples, castles, markets and other stuff their parents want to see. The aquarium is large with a large variety of fish/animals and good english translations. There is an interesting section on the fish in the Seoul area (Han river) and a great kids section where they can touch some sea shell and fish.  Combine the visit with some shopping in the Coex mall and you could easily spend a day here."
283,5.0,"Very nice aquarium with interacting activities for the kids do like touching water creatures. Cool designs with fish tanks. Highly recommend this place if you come during the hot summer months. After you are done, you can walk around the mall which has very nice movie theater, duty free shop and Hyundai Dept store at the other end of the COEX. I personally like this place then Seaworld!"
284,4.0,"This aquarium is not up to the standards of Long Beach or Toronto, but in a city that's a little short on activities for kids, it's not a bad place to spend an hour or so."
285,5.0,They offer Military Discounts You could spend the entire day walking around the aquarium Great for kids of all ages
286,5.0,"The aquarium has a wide variety of sea creatures. It was a very open area for the large amount of visitors and was pretty clean. I especially enjoyed how visitors could interact with some of the sea creatures (doctor fish, touching a starfish, etc.) and learn about some of the common illnesses in fish by looking under a microscope. The displays of the fish are also very creative; for example, one fish tank looked like a telephone box, and another looked like refrigerator."
287,5.0,Good aquarium to visit if you have not been to one ... but if you have been to the one in some of the other places (Singapore/Thailand/China) then you may not find it as special
288,5.0,Beautiful aquarium. It sure is a fun place for all family members to visit. It has hands on experience with the fishes. lots of fun.
289,4.0,For families with children and aquarium lover's this is a must especially if you are visiting Coex mall. Good variety of type of fish. Some local Korean fish. Feeding them is a good experience. I think the ticket was overpriced. The store at the end of aquarium has some nice stuff.
290,4.0,For those who have time to spend pleasant I recommend visiting the aquarium. Place abundant in fish sharks turtles. The aquarium is huge and been in a amazing mall.
291,4.0,"Looks like small - it indeed small - but with good interior and creative design, surprisingly it's very enjoyable. Recommended."
292,3.0,"A small scale aquarium in the COEX mall.  There are many kind of fishes and sea creatures (including seals and penguins). Quite interestingly, there are also some “non-sea creatures”, for example, monkey, rabbits,…etc.  I spent a 2 hours’ happy time at the aquarium. If you have extra time, especially on a rainy day, it is a good place to visit."
293,4.0,"First I thought it was a small place, but was surprised about how big it actually was. They have some great things for kids, they can touch some of the fish, see how they lay eggs, hatch and a special place with jellyfish. Not only fish, they have seals, manatees, penguins, otters, a croc, turtles and a lot more than I would expect. Though it's in a mall, the whole thing is quite big with a big tank and a glass tunnel. Kids will love this place, and so did I."
294,3.0,"Had a lot of beautiful fish displays but also a fair amount of animals too, like otters and beavers and Guinea pigs."
295,4.0,"This aquarium in the mall, dont have a lot of species of fish compare to ocean world. But the price i think is much cheaper.so for killing time 1-2 hours. This place is okay to visit. Fresh water have arapaima, red tail catfish, sturgeon, salt water is shark, manta and no whale here."
296,5.0,"It's just awesome, kids like it so much and don't want to leave. Every part of it is so attractive with different theme, be prepared to spend hours to experience it. I can't wait to be back."
297,5.0,"The COex aquarium has been designed to entertain all age groups. The money is worth spending. it takes 3 hours at least to cover. As compared to Dubai, Singapore and London, I found this to be bigger and more number of fish types"
298,3.0,"This is a ok aquarium but there are some things that let it down. Some of the tanks are a little small but this is due to the fact that it is in a mall. Despite this, it's still a nice way to spend the day.  For Conan O'Brien fans, they have Samuel the Octopus on display toward the end of the aquarium. They also have an exhibit of more ""unusual"" fish tanks, with fish inhabiting such things as sinks, fridges and phone booths.  This would be a good place to bring children. There's an ""aquarium passport"" that children can pick up and stamp along their way through the aquarium.  All in all, a decent enough aquarium but certainly not the best one I've been to."
299,5.0,"The only other Korean Aquarium we have been to is in Busan which was small. We were nervous about the Coex since it was in a mall. There was no problems! We went early on a Sunday and it was not as packed as we feared it would be. Our little ones, 3.5 and almost 2, had a blast. The only thing we didn't care for where the touch exhibits. Those poor aquatic animals. But since our kids enjoyed it, we would certainly go back."
300,5.0,"The first part is mostly local, freshwater fish. Don't spend too much time there if you want to see the sharks and octopi--there are lots of those later!"
301,4.0,"Loved the aquarium it starts with little tanks than gets bigger and better as it progresses , there are alot if things to see you can do this and explore within 2 hours"
302,5.0,"At first glance, i thought an aquarium in the middle of a mall, but i was very pleased. It had a lot of great aquatic creatures and was a good way to spend an hour"
303,3.0,"The highlight was the cool little water ballet routine by the food court the divers joining in making the kids laugh and when the sea life were being fed. There were interesting fish tanks made out of old appliances, sinks, vending machines ect.."
304,5.0,"We were pleasantly surprised by the quality and size of this aquarium. Lots of great exhibits with a variety of species from around the world, as well as many tanks highlighting the fish of Korea. Exhibits were cleverly displayed, most signs provided in both Korean and English. On a weekday late morning, we had the place almost to ourselves with very few other visitors in sight. This would be a great rainy day activity; as it was, it filled several hours before we had to leave for the airport at the nearby CALT center neighboring COEX. Great family activity, although my husband and I enjoyed it even without kids. It might be considered a bit pricey after the low cost entrance fees to the royal palaces and free entrance to the War Museum, but once inside we had no regrets over paying the $20-22 fee. Well worth it!"
305,5.0,"Went here with my boyfriend. It's very interesting! First they start of with small aquariums, but the further in you go the bigger it gets. The sharks was very interesting to see!"
306,2.0,"There isn't much you can really expect from an aquarium in a mall, but it's disappointing to see the conditions the sea mammals and birds are living in. The fish seemed fine, but the poor dugongs.... covered in layers of muck and so listless. This place is great for kids, but I'm grateful my daughter is too young to understand how bad the conditions were for the sea mammals."
307,5.0,"첫째가 물고기를 너무 좋아하여 연간회원 끊었어요. 3번만와도 본전뽑내요. 볼거리도 많고 직접 만져볼 수 있는 불가사리랑 멍게도 있고 애들이 너무 좋아하네요. My kid loves aquarium so we got the annual membership which is worth it. Lots of things to see and you could even touch the starfish. Pretty decent size place, not as big as Shedd Aquarium in Chicago but its got its own uniqueness."
308,5.0,"Very interesting place. We have really enjoyed. A lot of fantasy, a lot of imagination.We would like to have English guide."
309,5.0,"Being grown up in a coastl city, I had my fair share of visits to aquarium in India but Coex Aquarium beats it by far and large. Never ever miss visiting this place in your to-do list. You get to see a large variety of aquatic species and you can also touch few of them. What more, you get a free manicure inside :) That is, you are allowed to dip your hands in the aquarium of doctor fish, which eat away the dead cells of your skin. For those who are inquisitive and daring enough to touch will get a chance to touch the octopus!! You can see a wide range of jelly-fish. Ocean kingdom beats all with its collection of sharks, large fish, seals, turtles and what not. And penguins add more charm to the place :) What you must observe is not just the species but the aquarium as well. You must give accolades to them for their creativity. Ever imagined that your front load washing machine can be an aquarium? Or a bed lamp or a dressing table or a refrigerator or a public telephone booth for that matter? No? Well, then you will get to see them all and much more in Coex Aquarium."
310,5.0,Outstanding aqua life great how it set out and you can watch diver's do there thing with a shark great family day out
311,5.0,"We went on a weekday, so the crowds were minimal, it's a lovely acquarium and the kids loved it. Would recommend it to families with young children."
312,4.0,Many weird and abnormal aquarium tanks together with normal ones. Plenty of different fish to see and enjoy. Recommended.
313,5.0,"When we arrived lical people told us there are 2 whales living in the aauarium.  It sounded very strange but we said its worth check it out.  Well, no whales of course!! But its really beutiful aquarium filled with all the fishes you can think of.  Really recommended for anyone.  And there are instructions in english as well!!"
314,2.0,"it was so crowd i could not see half of fishes and great number of kid less then one year old...screaming crying those who could running, parents brining baby cares of course, the baby cares are very helpful in crowd you can push with it all people around. it is painful tho think how all oh those creatures exist in that hell all their life, show which they announced well....girls under the water making ege (stupid face which pretend to be cute and strange moving with hands close to face) and divers making heart shape with arms.....and all this hell going on in extremely crowd i would leave but just should stay because it was impossible. what surprised me more then greediness is cruelty they scare those creatures who hiding from people from behind so they coming to the front...then again scaring from all that screaming and shouting again hiding and again some scary sounds coming and and again they running in panic back to front....is it smart ? is is what for you use your brain dear owners of Coex Aquarium?"
315,5.0,"I thought it was a bit pricey going in, but then was impressed with the size of the aquarium especially for one that is inside a mall."
316,4.0,"i went there, and was totally empty, it was only my family, its good to give it a quick visit if you are in COEX complex."
317,4.0,"Such a perfect place to spend a rainy day. The aquarium was nice, a little smaller than we are used to but still very nice. Families with little children will enjoy it more than those with older. Another benefit is that Hard Rock Café Seoul is right upstairs from the Aquarium."
318,5.0,While staying in Seoul my fiancee took me to this Aquarium and I loved it. I loved the way it was organized. Happy to say it has English and Korean on the explanations of each animal (I was quite worried how to understand it). My favorite parts were the sardines and the huge shark tank. Oh almost forgot... and I loved Doctor Fish. I recommend if you are in Gangnam to not miss it.
319,4.0,"Older and more accessible exhibits. Loved learning about the jellyfish lifecycle. The sardines were captivating. Informative, well designed and original, Morning we went wasn't crowded at all."
320,4.0,"This is a nice aquarium underground in the COEX mall. Definitely good for little kids, but also adults who love the marine life!"
321,5.0,Coex Aquarium s located inside the coex mall. In the beginning of the visit I though that was so bad experience but the visit along the way is getting better and better. The high point is the sardines show. A very nice place to take children!
322,4.0,We loved the exhibit but would have love it more if there was an english translation or subtitle on the show with the sardines. Because it seem very nice and our kids would have been able to appreciate watching it more if they understood.
323,4.0,Went on a Sunday and it wasn't that busy. Really wasn't expecting the aquarium to be this nice. Had a lot of animals and gave a discount on parking. Weekdays have more shows than weekends. Really happy and it was well worth the price of admission.
324,5.0,"I have been to Korea many times, but first time visiting COEX Aquarium as my baby really love fishes. We spent almost a good 3 hours inside, we enjoyed it so much and my baby really didnt want to leave the place! We had fish spa for our fingers, took many pictures, wow at many exhibits and enjoyed the show! Thanks to the cleaner for telling us there's a show going on (as I understood Korean), the very kind diver even made a 'Saranghae' action to my baby which he still remembers till date! Thumbs up!"
325,5.0,"This aquarium was a lot of fun. Even though we weren't coming here with kids it was a very enjoyable. It took us about 2 1/2 hours to get through all of the exhibits, but with kids I would plan more time. We really enjoyed the exhibits with the fish in random object such as a coke machine, and a fridge. That exhibit also had rabbits and guinea pigs in a bathroom setting that was quite humorous. It wasn't too crowded even though we went there the day after Christmas."
326,4.0,You must get the feel of this place. Worth spending money on it. You will get to see shark also. It will pass over your hear. It is just awesome.
327,5.0,"One of the best aquariums I've been to. From the outside it looks like it is going to be a small aquarium, but inside it is very well done. A lot of time has been taken to decorate this aquarium. Spent a lot of time walking around. Would be great with little kids. It is great for big kids too :)"
328,5.0,The wife and I just so happen to be walking around the coex mall and saw signs for the aquarium so it peaked our interest. Was not expecting so much. It had a lot of different exhibits and provided places to make some great memories.
329,5.0,"coex aquarium is indoor which is good that you plan to go here during bad weather. foreigners who ride public transportation would past through sm town where you can buy plenty of band items there such as exo, girls generation and so on. coming back to coex aquarium. the price is not bad because of the wide aquarium and types of fishes, sharks and mammals you see. there are also a few stops where you can touch the creatures which is a great experience for anyone at any age :D thumbs up from mee !!"
330,2.0,"It is very clean, and it is very polished. But.... it is a private aquarium in the middle of a shopping mall. It is very expensive for a family of four, and not worth the price of admission."
331,2.0,"inside a Huge mall, you will need 20min to find it since it's deep down, the ticket is for 20Euros, the tour can be done in 30min, in the morning you will find School kids with there teachers, it has a nice introduction to sea life"
332,5.0,"The Aquarium will take you about at least 1 hour to walk around. Lots of ocean fish near the middle towards the end of the Aquarium. My kids love it especially they can feel and touch some of the sea creatures. Do ask for location of the coex aquarium as its a huge mall. If you are taking a taxi, do print the name address in korean characters."
333,4.0,This is located inside of the huge COEX mall. Path to the aquarium is well marked. Lots of fish from around the globe. Big shark tank and they had a show with divers. The grandkids enjoyed it.
334,4.0,"The COEX Aquarium is a fantastic aquarium for the price point. It starts off slow with really small fish and sea creatures, but eventually opens up to larger tanks and fish. I would say this COEX Aquarium is almost as good as the Jeju Aquarium, but it's half the price."
335,3.0,"On a work trip so decided to drop by, the shows were average and was hoping to see a bigger tank (I was comparing to my experience in Osaka and Singapore aquariums). Entrance fee is 22,000 won, that said they made the whole experience very convenient, with multiple lockers, clear signs, interaction with sea creatures etc. it was just smaller than expected."
336,2.0,I enjoyed the aquarium greatly and the animals were interesting and you can get really close to them. The reason for the two star rating is because the aquarium is way overpriced it's almost $30 just to see animals like penguins and turtles so it really wasn't worth the time yes it was beautiful and I enjoyed it too but save your money there are better places in Seoul ♡
337,5.0,"This is very good for children.  It is underground. So you can have a plan under bad weather conditions.  There is beautiful Budhist Temple, Bongjeongsa Temple where the ""Monk Exam"" was held. Actually Aquarium is the very place of Exam.  :)"
338,2.0,The Coex Aquarium is small and had a stale fish smell starting from main entrance. Not much fish to see but many parents brought their children there to watch the fishes.
339,2.0,"COEX was supposed to be a big center considering the reviews I have read. Well, it is not. Small shopping mall and unimpressive Aquarium. There is a Budhist temple just in front of it that is much more interesting"
340,4.0,"Very easy to find, it is within the Coex complex. It displayes some rare and not so rare fish and the best ones are the Sharks, so close to the visitors."
341,3.0,If you will visit Coex Mall you have to go to Coex aquanrium~ i can be having fun with lover or children.
342,5.0,The COEX Aquarium is located at the Coex Shopping Centre where you would never expect to find an aquarium. The displays and fish are very nicely presented. One of the best Aquariums I have been to.
343,5.0,"Located in the Coex Mall, this aquarium is entirely underground. When we started out I was thinking it looked like a fish store which didn't make me happy. However as we moved on, this turned out to be a most wonderful aquarium, it matches any worldwide large aquarium easily. I really enjoyed this."
344,5.0,"as expected, it will give you joy and entertainment in a calm manner. the usual aquariums but different design approach."
345,4.0,"If you get tired of shopping check out the aquarium! I was pleasantly surprised by how big it is. It took me about 2 hours on my own. It might take longer with children. There are a number of fun exhibits including one where they turned everyday objects into fish tanks. They made a refrigerator, washing machine and phone booth into tanks. They are really cool. The aquarium has manatees, sharks, seals and more."
346,2.0,"I read some reviews about it and I had high expectations about it but unfortunately when I went there i found it normal , nothing special about it and it is even less than normal."
347,3.0,Visited the Aquarium to kill time. It is more suitable for young children than grown ups. Had a good display of different species of fish though. The live Penguin feeding was interesting.
348,5.0,"I have seen a lot of aquariums and this was definitely one of the best. Not only is it informative but it's also entrain img as they try to put their own twist on it. You can even touch some fish there!! Would recommend about 2-3 hours but I could easily have spent all day there. If I ever go back to South Korea again, I will definitely be going there!"
349,4.0,"It's nice place but don't expect to see something special. It's more for kids than adults. However, you should see it when you visit Coex Mall."
350,4.0,"it was my second visit, love the place, clean, lots of things to see. a bit different with my first visit."
351,3.0,"A small aquarium in the shopping mall Gangnam. Can try to put your hands in the water tub which is full of small fish to nibble away dead skin on your fingers. The best part is at the end of the aquarium, therefore if not much to tour around, then move faster to see the most instresting views at the end of the route."
352,4.0,"A lot larger than I expected. Great collection of fish, and a nice break from wandering the cavernous mall and losing money at the casino (slots only!)"
353,4.0,"I am a huge fan of aquariums, so I enjoyed COEX aquarium. Fish of all kinds is a feast for eyes. COEX also has otters and parrots inside. The only drawback is price. It's a bit expensive comparing to what the aquarium offers."
354,3.0,"Its a bit expensive, but generally was okay. Lots of different fishes.... We even managed to get into mermaid show."
355,3.0,"There are some nice displays but the huge tank at the end was really the best part, with its large fish, turtles and sharks. There ""SHOW"" consisted of the large tank .feeding It was very crowded and had many children but might be different during the week. There are wheelchairs if you need to use one."
356,3.0,"Visited the COEX Aquarium after a visit to Bongeunsa Temple. Not a really big aquarium, tanks are mostly small. However, i enjoyed their ""petting zoo"", whereby we were allowed to get up close to sea creatures. Overall an average experience, for I have seen bigger Aquariums."
357,2.0,"It's in the Coex mall and it's pretty much like every other small aquarium you've ever gone to. If you absolutely have nothing better to do, go ahead and spend 20,000+krw. Frankly, I'd rather walk around the mall (I hate malls), see a movie and have a bite to eat."
358,4.0,I was here few times. And always enjoy my visiting. They had a very wide range of animals and the exhibits are very well maintained. It takes about 2 hours to look through all the exhibits
359,3.0,"After 5 years in Korea, I finally gave in an went to Coex Aquarium with my boyfriend's sister and nieces. In all honesty, I've never been a fan of aquariums, but this one is nothing special. It's crowded, the tanks are too small for many of the larger fish/mammals and most people are more interested in taking photos of themselves at the aquarium that actually looking at anything. There are other (better) sites to see in Seoul (and Korea) that are cheaper and a far better use of time."
360,5.0,"Awesome is the word. This place should be in the must go place in your trip. The coex mall in itself is very large and you cannot even imagine so big aquarium inside the mall.  They have created an environment where fish can be found everywhere. In refrigerator, washing machine, phone booths etc etc. They have large varieties of fish available. There is also a show inside which is also very good.  Overall you will find a day very well utilized in Seoul :) :)"
361,5.0,They say that this is the second largest in Asia. So beautiful the entire tour will take an hour but it is must visit and every penny value. The kids will love it. Staff very efficient.
362,5.0,"So this place is actually in the Coex Mall. I spent a couple hours here checking out the fish and little wild life they had. There were so many fish and some of the designs for the aquariums holding the fish were interesting...one set of fish live in a little place that makes music by the movement of the fish. Another set of fish lived in a sink, another set in a refridgerator! They also have a set of doctor fish -but the ones from Turkey, not from China-. I'm not sure why that was important, but there is a plaque next to the wall stating this info. There is also an area for penguins and seals and manitees. The seals were so fun because they kept playing with me through the glass. I would recommend this place for all ages!"
363,4.0,"Coex aquarium is definitely worth a visit if you have some spare time. The aquarium is well set out,the displays are very well done and it was good to see them feeding the fish. Being in a large shopping mall there is many places where you can get something to eat and do some window shopping after you have been through the aquarium. Look for the Hyundai shopping centre if you are into food. The presentation is something special however check the prices before you buy. Get the subway back. A day well spent."
364,3.0,I like to visit Aquariums when I travel and this is a nice one but it is really geared for small children.
365,5.0,"Coex Aquarium is huge aquarium, and has a lot of different kinds of sea animals. Sharks are the main icon of the aquarium. The restaurant Deep Blue will offer great experience to you."
366,4.0,I thought it will just be another aquarium but it is nice! Aquarium in the city and they display many modernized aquarium setting. Worth going for a different aquarium experience.
367,3.0,I saw so many school kids enjoying their visit but to me it was not the best choice. however I recorded some movies to show to my little daughter.
368,5.0,"This is one of the best aquariums I have been to. They had a very wide range of animals and the exhibits are very well maintained like everything else we had visited in Seoul. May seem a little pricey but very in line with what everything else in Seoul costs. Our boys - 4, 7, 11 - had a such a great time and couldn't stop talking about how much fun it was. The 11 year old said it was so much better than he expected! We stayed about 2 hours which was enough time to see all the exhibits and get out of the heat. It was a little busy but was assuming that it is end of summer trips for many."
369,2.0,I really advice you not to waste your time as you have alternatives. Yes it is a good place to visit but seoul is a full city with many thing better than this place
370,5.0,"I think people are being a little too harsh on this place...  In regards to what others have said, ""too expensive"" or ""not worth the price for the size"" and ""I've been to better.""  My thoughts on these comments:  ""too expensive"" and ""not worth the price for the size"" It's 22,000 won for an adult (which is about $22). That's a few dollars cheaper than the other aquariums I've been to. So with that being said I don't think it was too expensive. I also have to say that it felt a lot bigger (maybe even double) the size of the aquariums I've been to (Aquarium by the Bay in San Francisco and Sea Life at the Mall of America.) So I have to say that it's worth the price for the size.  ""I've been to better"" I have to say this tops my list for aquariums. It was mapped out perfectly and you flowed through the place. It was more than just fish but mammals as well. I doubt I'll ever go to another aquarium that has penguins, seals, sea otters, manatees, crocodiles, etc. all in one place. Other highlights for me: cool fish tank displays (working Coke machine, washing machine) and ""Dr. Fish."""
371,4.0,The aquarium took about 2 hours. Kids enjoyed the unconventional tanks! We walked around Coex mall and then spent some time at the bookstore. It's a great place to spend on a rainy day in Seoul!
372,5.0,I especially loved the interactive displays and the glass tunnel. Many different types of sea creatures.
373,5.0,I love coex aquarium! Located within a mall there was alot to do even after u left. The aquarium itself is separated into different sections and now includes a touch and see section and where you can actually touch the fishes (its actually more like the mussels and etc type stuff) as well as dip your hands for the doctor fishes (known to eat the dead skin off your hands/feet). Theres also a science laboratory section where you can see the growth stages of the sea creatures. Best thing is that they made it so that you can easily take photos without it reflecting light off your pictures. Whole thing should take a bit over an hr. Hope u enjoy!
374,2.0,"Quite a standard aquarium experience. In the middle there are some funny installations, such as ""phone booth aquarium"", or fishes swimming inside a laundry machine. A bit expensive compared to other major aquariums in Asia."
375,4.0,"I really didn't want to go to the aquarium, but my husband insisted we look at the fish so I went with him. The price about $20 usd was a bit steep I thought, but none-the-less we entered. Never have I been so pleasantly surprised! The place was well layed out, with arrows pointing the direction so you didn't collide with other observers and just enough light to see, but not so much that the place seemed artificial and gaudy. Not only does the aquarium house fish, but it also has turtles, rabbits, alligators, beavers, and prairie dogs. In some cases, I saw creatures in person that until then I had only seen on Animal Planet or the Discovery Channel. I must say, the Coex Aquarium is a wonderful attraction and a must see if you visit Seoul."
376,5.0,"We had such a good day at the aquarium. This is such an unexpectedly good attraction in the COEX mall. It is one of the largest aquaria we have ever been to. There are all sorts of animals that live in the water here (not just fish) such as beavers, alligators, penguins, otters and huge turtles. The entrance price is quite high but, I think, entirely worth it. We did get a discount as we had bought something at one of the stores in the mall. We spent around 2 1/2 hrs here. If you time it right, try and see some of the feeding times. Penguins at 15.30. We found the keepers very respectful of the animals too as they were observing a penguin"
377,2.0,"We have been to many aquariums, this one was nothing special in our opinion. The cost to get in is not worth it. For the price, it needs to be 2-3 times larger. Our pre-teens were bored. We spent maybe 2 hours here. And that was us TRYING to take our time and read everything to get our moneys worth."
378,4.0,Good to see some very cute looking fish tanks. Not an enormous aquarium but big enough for me to walk around and relax looking at the fishes swim.
379,4.0,Not cheap but worth the price. Had a blast with a family of friends. We went on Tuesday and we got lucky because it wasn't crowded and we could appreciate the all the cool upgrades😊.
380,4.0,"A great place to visit if you're staying in the area, for sure. Nearby the buffet (which has wine!). Also, ask for the foreigner discount if you're not Korean to save a bit of money on admission."
381,4.0,"My family stayed at the Intercontinental Coex and walked along the corridors to the subway often. We passed the Coex Aquarium frequently and made a point to visit before our trip to Seoul was complete.  This is a pretty big aquarium. I think it's bigger than the 63 Sea World, we liked it even better than 63 Sea World. There were lots of fish, sharks, rays, seals, jelly fish, penguins, and a touch pool area.  There was an area geared towards kids but it was a little bit run down when we visited and not all the exhibits worked. We were a little disappointed, but aside from that everything was well maintained and the homes of the creatures looked clean and cared for. There were many many tanks to see animals in. They boast 3,000 tons of water with 650 species, and 40,000 living things.  The place is open 10am to 8pm every day of the year. Even when they are closed they have a couple beautiful tanks outside filled with color fish to entice you to return when they are open.  They have an overpriced cafe and a souvenir shop. They are a little on the expensive side at about $19 for adults, and $14 for kids. We saw the entire place in about an hour.  Our favorite parts included the Japanese garden type area with a huge koi pond, the photo op type things you stick your head through, that they had a chipmunk at an aquarium, the seahorses, the penguins, and the jellyfish."
382,5.0,"I visited the COEX Aquarium today and I really enjoyed it. The themes are good, with ample species of fish and wildlife. It is the first time I saw penguins and beavers in captivity. It was also the first time I saw a living corral. The show was also good, and it did not involve petting animals. Overall a good two hours well spent."
383,4.0,"I was under the impression this place was going to be a really cruel place with no room for the animals to move but I was pleasantly surprised. The rabbits (yes they have rabbits) had heaps of room! Most fish tanks were relatively full for the smaller fish but nothing horrendous! The tanks for the larger animals such as sharks, stingray, manatee etc were huge and they had heaps of room! The only cage that I didn't like was for the monkey :( he needed more room. Otherwise the place in general was very exciting and fun - even for older people! The 'doctor' fish that eat dead skin cells off your hands and the Sharks were definitely my highlight! In my opinion overall worth the money and recommend!"
384,4.0,"We thought the COEX Aquarium looked modern and was imaginatively laid out. To us, it was better than most, not as good as some others. It had enough of interest to keep us occupied for a little over an hour. It is located in a large shopping centre."
385,4.0,"This is a pretty good aquarium, better than I thought it would be. It is a great place for small children with many features provided for their benefit, like an acquatic petting zoo! There is a tube shaped aquarium with a beautiful array of sharks and rays and other species. There is enough English signage for non-Koreans. Bathrooms are easily reachable."
386,4.0,"Went here on thursday afternoon and not many people around. I was disappointed at the start because the first half of the aquarium all you see was small tanks with random species of freshwater fish, saltwater fish and other animals that are not exactly water bound. I understand otter, frogs, waterbugs, turtles and saltwater crocodiles being there but squirrels, rabbits and bats? Anyhow, the exhibits for the smaller animals needed upgrading. I have seen children aquarium better than those. I mean, plastic seaweed, people? Really? But luckily things got better from there. The bigger tanks had giant manatees, and some other rare species. Jellyfish aquarium was so much fun. Saltwater aquariums grouped by region (hawaii tank, pacific tank, great barrier reef and so on) were fabulous. The shark tank and the silvery school of fish in the main tank took my breath away. Too bad most of animal information was written in korean, only the names were written in english. Adults will probably spend 1 hour here walking leisurely but if you are travelling with kids be prepared to spend around 2 hours or more."
387,1.0,50 fish to one small tank. The place is busy and the fish are in tiny tanks. I love Korea but I don't like the zoos etc over there.
388,5.0,This aquarium is in the Coex Mall. I thought it's a small one with exhibition of just some fish according to the map given. Yet the route shown on the map is not in proportion or ratio in any sense. My 7-yr-old enjoyed strolling around a lot. There are some shallow tanks where you can touch different species too.
389,1.0,"My friends and I were visiting Seoul for just 2 days. we decided to take a city tour that included the Codex Aquarium. My friends enjoy diving and marine anything. The building that houses the Aquarium is a marvel. There are shops and restaurants and meeting places for large events. A huge facility. The entry to the exhibit space is colorful and welcoming. And then it happens. You see large tanks of huge fish, so full of fish that it looks like one of those choose your own fish for supper places. Sadly, it gets worse, because they also have marine mammals, otters etc. and they have no room to swim, little tiny bits of water in the very front of the case, no privacy areas. They have Bats, where they cannot fly. They have Manatees just in a tank, no environment and with 3 beasts no room to really move and nowhere to move to. Really really sad. The whole thing is just heart breaking. Kids who don't know any better will love it. But their parents who should know better should not take them there and support this cruel treatment."
390,4.0,"I thought an aquarium inside a mall would be an over-sized pet store with some fish. In reality this aquarium is large, and has a lot of exhibits. Marine mammals, birds, a wide array of fish. The displays are good. Entry price is about $20."
391,4.0,"That title is actually true, seriously check it out.  Anyway... this place has everything from penguins to dolphins, fantastic shows and feed (i recommend getting there earlier so you can follow the feeding and enjoy the shows. so much to see that you certainly won't be bored. everything from the colourful to the fantastic."
392,4.0,"Great place, spent hours in here on numerous visits. Interesting and creative displays and so many different tanks and exhibits. Well maintained and great fun."
393,5.0,"I have visited aquariums in Indonesia, Bangkok, Osaka and Tokyo. But from my point of view, this one is the best!  The place is huge, well maintained, clean, and consist of thousand varieties of sea creatures.  We spent almost 4 hours inside, and my kids love this place very much.  A very worth visit!"
394,5.0,"I had never been to an aquarium before. I thought its gonna be boring. But this place is amazing, and I loved the variety they have and amazing experience indeed."
395,5.0,"We really enjoyed spending some unique time in this special place. Many species of fishes and a lot of more than that. Sharks were the nicest part for me. I think that the price was a little higher, but it is strongly recommended."
396,4.0,"Yes, it is an aquarium in a shopping mall, but surprisingly well done: clean, well-organized, well-labeled (sufficient English signage and labels), well-lit. The animals all appear to be well-cared-for and displayed in suitable educational settings. That said, there are also humorous and creative goldfish tanks in washing machines and other unexpected setups. I would call this a must-see stop for kids and aquarium aficionados. We saw the sardine-dancing show, which was clearly for the kids -- scuba divers in royal robes -- but still entertaining. We went on a holiday, so it was really crowded, though still manageable. It is not cheap, but not outrageous, for 3 good hours of educational entertainment. If you live in the area, buy an annual pass, to bypass the ticket queue. I mean, you can go shopping, go to a movie, and drop by the shark tank. What more could you ask for?"
397,4.0,"For an aquarium in a mall, it had an impressive variety of fish. Many small tropical to even large shark tank. Location was very convenient with large number of restaurants in mall. Easy access to subway"
398,4.0,"This is a really nice aquarium with many more amazing fish, sharks, and sea creatures than I expected. We really enjoyed it, especially the large exhibits with turtles, sharks, and sting rays. Somewhat pricey, but not exorbitant."
399,4.0,My kids both 12 and 10 years old both loved this Coex Aquarium!! they had seen here several sea animals that they have never seen before.. Very educational and very clean. I especially love how they design the aquarium of the sea animals!!! very creative!!! Love this aquarium!!!
400,4.0,"This is not Sea World, but it is the nicest aquarium in Seoul - plenty of interesting exhibits, and it can get a little crowded at times in some of the narrower spaces. Very interesting fish exhibits from around the world, with some mammals (penguins, manatees, otters, etc) and amphibians mixed in. Plan to time your visit around some of the live feeding shows - the staff put on an entertaining underwater show in their wet suits and costumes. The aquarium is located on the lower level of the mall, so there are plenty of dining options right nearby. Best to go during the week when things are a bit less crowded - the entry fee was not exorbitant, about $20 US for adults, a bit less for teens and younger children. You can easily spend 3 hours strolling and viewing the exhibits."
401,4.0,"The COEX Aquarium in Gangnam district, Seoul, is one of South Korea's largest Aquariums with over 40,000 creatures from over 650 species on display. The COEX Aquarium features 90 exhibition tanks grouped in fourteen ""discovery zones"", including six themed areas. The aquarium is housed within the COEX mall. I particularly loved Wonderland - the home of unusual fish tanks in the form of toilet bowls, telephone booth (yes, the big red telephone booth and imagine it with fish inside)...Wonderland brings together a crazy collection of eccentric fish tanks. The shower-cubicle tank is home to a yellow-bearded dragon fish, and there is a seahorse living in a computer monitor. Put your hand in the bathtub and you will be tickled by doctor fish, from the river basins of Turkey. The Seven Seas features a kaleidoscope of tropical fish while Ocean Kingdom is home to dozens of sharks, rays and huge schools of fish, creating a real sense of life in the deep seas. We stayed for quite a while in Ocean Kingdown admiring the sharks :)"
402,4.0,"Coex Aquarium is inside Coex Mall. Coex Mall is connected to the subway & easily accessible. However, this mall is a high end mall & we did not really shop there."
403,4.0,"Lots of beautiful creatures in relatively good sized aquariums. Some creatures in cages/aquariums that were far too small. The information boards, for the majority, were easy to translate into common english. The exhibitions were interesting. We had 3 hours to look around and found it not quite enough time."
404,4.0,"We went here last weekend with a 14 year only and a four year old. If you have little ones, don't go on the weekend unless you want to carry them the whole time so they can see. It was extreamly crowded and backpacks and purses were knocking my little guy constantly. There is free stroller parking and lockers for 1000-2000 won. It cost around 70000 won for our family. We enjoyed it. The sea lions and manatees were great, especially at feeding time. There was a diver and fish show that was cool too. They have an exhibit area that had a variety of artistic shapes aquariums. The pufferfish, shark, and seahorses were great. There was an electric eel display and plenty on cool river fish. Many of the fish names were labeled in English, but the descriptions were all in Hungul. Overall, a fun way to spend a few hours. I would go back on a weekday. Tip: bring your lic. Plate number and type it into the kiosk at the entrance for discounted parking. There are English signs in the parking garage for the aquarium. The CoEx mall also has lots of food choices, a theater, and a giant 2 story slide."
405,4.0,"The Coex aquarium is located inside the Coex Mall, on the lower level. It is open till 8pm. Since it is in the mall, you can enjoy many of the restaurants inside the mall. Entrance for adults is 22000 won."
406,4.0,"I really enjoyed the Coex aquarium. Visitors are directed through the museum along a prescribed path, with each room or area promoting some different theme. There were fish that I had never seen before and some especially interesting creatures (the manatee exhibit was very cool). There were a few displays/pens that I found a bit disturbing due to the size. I found the monkey, beaver and crocodile exhibits to be far too small. On the whole however, I though it was great and would definitely recommend it."
407,4.0,"When you see the Aquarium from inside COEX Mall, it's deceiving. It seems like it would be a very small aquarium. But once you're inside, it keeps going and going with pleasant surprises. I especially liked seeing the sharks through the clear glass tunnel. I also enjoyed seeing the penguins jump in and out of the water. There are two downsides to this aquarium. It's very crowded on Saturday afternoons which should come as no surprise. You'll be bombarded with kids and some parents that might bump into you with their strollers. Also, the prices are a bit steep (22,000 won for adults, 19,000 for middle/high school students, and 16,500 for senior citizens). But if you're patient, you'll be able to enjoy a nice experience."
408,4.0,Me and the Mrs missed this place on our last journey but we finally made it on time. We enjoyed this one more than the Building 63's Aqaurium. The animals here seemed more alive....well there was one beaver that seemed sickly. I think we stopped and took photos at every area. What was awesome were the dipping dot ice cream. I haven't had those in forever. My wife loved them as well. We did the one time purchase vs the annual membership....not sure why anyone woukd do a annual membership to an aquarium but each their own. Take your children here....they will have a blast
409,3.0,"The aquarium was well maintained. I went during the day on Thursday so there were not many other people visiting but several preschool classes. Children will enjoy this most but adults can still appreciate all the different species of fish and amazing colors of saltwater fish! I have been to other aquariums so this did not excite me a whole lot but my mother had never seen anything like this and was amazed! One interesting aspect was the ""tunnel"" that you can walk through, it is as if you are in Biblical times when the Red Sea was parted. That was the most interesting part and best viewing area."
410,5.0,"Maybe this is not the best aquarium in the world, but my 10yo and I spent a nice afternoon visiting this aquarium. Despite the fact that most explanations are in Korean, the visit is very pleasant, relaxing, interesting. The shows are great, the undersea tunnel is amazing...and we especially loved the fish doctors: you put your fingers in a small aquarium, and the little fishes come and clean the dead skin on them. Very funny! And like in North america, you exit the aquarium by the gift shop...very smart! Easy to please your child with not so many Won."
411,4.0,"My wife and I did this attraction towards the end of our trip and really enjoyed it, it's not far from the Buddhist Temple in Gangnam and is a great way to spend a couple of hours. The price isn't too bad from memory and a lot of the fishes and other animals would not be seen in any other aquariams.  Well worth the trip."
412,4.0,If you like aquariums you'll like this one too. Offers good views of the fish and loads of different kinds of fish. Nice attraction for 2-3 hours.
413,5.0,"The aquarium was different form the ones I have seen in the state, the places were they keep their fish are very unique and everything seems very close you can almost touch them. Nice trip if you are visiting with young children."
414,5.0,"My favorite aquarium in USA is Montreal Bay Aquarium in California, and this one comes close to it. This aquarium is located under the Coex complex where all the major trading events are held. With tons of shopping opportunities, restaurants, and movie theater within the complex, it is a great place to spend a day especially when the weather is not good."
415,4.0,It offer good aquarium's view and clean and also Kids love this. but this facility is not that big place than I expected.
416,4.0,"The aquarium in Seoul is great. Located right in the middle of the city in the modern COEX mall, it is easy to get to by subway, walking, or bus. It is really nice.  I went with my girlfriend on a weekend, and it was crowded, but the flow was good. It is underground, so it is really cool and well ventilated, and I never felt like I was in a big crowd. Everyone moved around and through the line really well, and everyone was happy, especially the kids.  With so much to see, it is laid out and designed very well. Along with the most beautiful sea creatures that you will ever see, there are extras like other animals and reptiles. Lots of fun with a Disney like flair with little props and stages for the kids.  There are drink machines all along the ""caves"" inside, so you will not go thirsty, and plenty of staff around to help at any time. Perfect day for the family. Going fast, 1 hour. Taking your time, 3 hours. Well worth the $22 admission price."
417,5.0,"Nice place where you can easily spend an hour or even two. Many children. A little bit expensive, but inside there are many unusual expositions, like telephon box filled with fishes. Actually, i like everything in it :) At friday, in the morning about 11am, there aren't many people here."
418,4.0,"I havn't been to so many aquariums since they mostly display the same things. That beeing said I really liked this one. It's fairly big and have many different kinds of fish and other animals living in water (penguins, seals and sea lions etc.) We spent some hours here. There is a snacks area where you can buy hot dogs and drinks. They also have a souvenier shop that was good."
419,1.0,"Went there with 5 adult and 1 child (2year old) on Saturday afternoon. We just went there because we had a lunch reservation at coex intercontinental hotel and my mom wanted a place to spend some time with her grandchild after lunch. Even though I wasn't looking too much forward, I was disappointed. It was really crowded and everybody was just walking in line to see rows of tiny view through a small window. However just to give some ways of discount info, it's 22000krw for 1 adult but you can buy discount ticket for 3 or 4 from internet mall in advance and you can save approx 25% of the cost. Children under 47months is free per 1 adult. The annual pass is approx 2.3 times the 1 time entrance so if you plan to go more than 3 times definitely worth getting the annual pass although I would not get it myself. If you have seen good aquarium, you probably don't want to go there but no offence I really wish you have fun if you are going~!"
420,5.0,"Not huge but very attractive. They have many funny tanks like washer or harp-shaped tank with electronic strings which are make sound when a fish cross it. As for me the most amazing critters in Aquarium are manatees, seal and beavers. Manatees are look like huge sea cows who are pasturing under the water. What else. They have Electric eel hunting show. I missed it but it has to be very interesting. I watched one in other Aquarium and that is very unusual and cognitive. Try to find the feeding schedule so you will have more fun.  The ""touch zoo"" tank was filled with frozen cold water so it is almost not possible to touch and play with starfishes in there. That is a great minus."
421,1.0,"It's expensive. Around 20,000 won. The space is small, so it gets crowded very easily. The animals were poorly kept. The tanks weren't clean. It had an interesting smell. I was really turned off by the venue. There was one area that seemed to get more attention than all the others. It's an open amazon kind of space. That was the most interesting. I will not go there again."
422,4.0,"At first, we thought it was pricey too just to see some fishes, but behold! You thought it's small when you buy tickets and get to the entrance, but every step that we took and we saw a lot more than different kinds of sea creatures. They also have cute penguins, monkeys and more animals inside. You wouldn't believe there would be this sight just inside a mall."
423,4.0,"I really liked this place. 22,000won per person may be a little pricey to some people, but I did get to see many interesting marine animals. The place is well planned out and clearly labelled. I loved the thrasher shark although it wasn't labelled. (I hope I got the name right.)  However, there were many people who seemed to not know how to behave in the aquarium. Adults trying to lift tank covers, tapping on tanks. Children shouting, flipping starfishes over at the petting pool, picking starfishes up and out of the water despite signs specifically telling them not to.  All of these are not faults of the aquarium, but I think more staff need to be present to ensure that the welfare of the animals are taken care of. The visitors who behave inappropriately need to be reminded that their actions are unacceptable."
424,4.0,"Visited on a weekend so there was quite a large crowd. Pretty worth it for the price (especially when compared to where I come from) as there was a large variety of fishes to be seen. It was also inside a mall, which made it pretty convenient to visit."
425,5.0,"Originally I had visited COEX Mall for some shopping but little did I know that it was closed for renovation! I was so devastated until I found out that it has an Aquarium inside. Honestly an aquarium in a shopping mall, I did not think much of it but went in anyway since I didn't want my visit to be an entire waste of time and man was I surprised. I haven't had so much fun in ages, I felt like a little child again. There was a fair number and variety of animals on show and we spent a good couple of hours in here unknowingly. Definitely worth a visit."
426,4.0,"It was kinda boring at first but it became more exciting as I walked further, I saw various of marine life together in one trip, from a tiny jellyfish to a huge shark and mantaray in different size of aquarium! penguin,catfish,manatee, you name it..almost everything can be find here..The not so enjoyable part is, it was too crowded with people especially kids and the price is quite expensive."
427,5.0,"We went here one afternoon because we had run out of things to do. I had wanted to go, but it was a bit pricey so it wasn't high on the priority list when I was planning.  So glad we went!! It's really well put together. The animals are well cared for and the exhibits are really quirky. Some English, but not a lot, so sometimes you might want to know more about an animal or one of their educational exhibits but the information just wasn't available.  It's actually in a really classy shopping centre (the COEX) which we quite enjoyed walking through to get there."
428,5.0,I went to this place by myself because my buddies did not want to pay the expensive fees. It was neat none the less. It's more for the younger crowd and there isn't much in English... But I was ok as I know fish and aquatic life fairly well. Makke sure you have enough time!
429,4.0,"Decent visit, The aquarium doesn't offer much description other then Korean, so much of my visit I have to relies on my limited knowledge of marine life to figure out what I were seeing. the first level was.rather underwhelming, but it get better as you go down in level. good place to spend a morning but do get there early. it can get very crowed approaching noon."
430,1.0,"Do NOT go to this aquarium! I only went because I was visiting the temple across the street which was closed, and I had an hour and a half I had to kill. The aquarium charged $22 U.S. dollars, but it was SO bad that it should have cost $1. This is only if you have little kids with you as they would probably be the only ones to enjoy it as they wouldn't know any better. It was by far the worst aquarium/attraction that I have ever been to in my life. It was so bad that I think I went through the whole place in about 10 minutes. I have never written a poor review but going to another country and spending $22 on a worthless rip off should be warned to all travelers! Again, do NOT waste your money or your time!!!"
431,4.0,Visited in March 2014 with my wife and son. He was very excited. But the entry fee was steep at 17$$. But it was ok. The only complaints is the boards and the explanations could have been in English. Not able to read the signs. But worth visiting if going with kids. Situated in the basement of COEX mall and convention center.
432,1.0,"Quite possibly the worst rip-off in Seoul. For $17 admission fee you get little value. You get poor signage, incoherent educational value, questionable exhibits (aquarium with a bathroom setting?) and no standout animal attractions.  Save your money and check out the free seafood markets instead."
433,5.0,"My boys really enjoyed this aquarium. There are a lot of unique displays made of random items, like aquariums made out of televisions or phone booths and the like. It's quite large and has many interesting specimens. We also got a kick out of the doctor fish where one can stick their hand in the tank and have the fish nibble off the dead skin. Fun times...more expensive than most of the other attractions we saw in Seoul, but for our boys, it was a nice break from all the history and culture."
434,4.0,"This a beautifully presented aquarium and very Korean. It was simply ideal for my grandson whom loves fishes . They are very easy to see, with most displays going down to toddler height. There are some very beautiful highly colored fish including the orange and white 'Nemo' fish and some very impressive Manatee, sharks and Rays. There are cutesy displays like fish in pretend frigs, but the western - one can only show fish in a natural looking environment - attitude, may not necessarily be the best and only way . Let the Koreans have fun! There is a great jungle display and a fabulous coral section - absolutely true to what I have seen snorkeling on the Australian Great Barrier Reef . There are many captions and explanations in English and explanations of how they feed the fish, complete with microscopes to look down . The jelly fish are beautiful . Feeding time for the penguins was at 3:30 and there are other feeding times around 300 pm . At half the price of the Sydney aquarium, it's good value . We went on a Tuesday and it wasn't crowded at all The aquarium is a 8 min walk from Samsung subway and there is an underground route if you want . The whole complex is very upmarket with lots of eateries (not cheap) and shops"
435,5.0,"Though not very very large, it has all the stuff I want for an aquarium. Really loved how it zones its sea creatures."
436,4.0,"Pretty good.Quite a big aquarium which takes an hour to walk past all the exhibits at a reasonable pace. My particular interest is Salt water Reef which it really was a bit short of...the usual huge tanks with sharks and rays...the usual suspects, Grey Nurse and reef sharks, a decent Tiger a bit unusual in a tank. Good seals and penguins, a great Sea Cow/Manatee/Dugong tank. Quite a lot of freshwater stuff which was interesting but not my obsession...some really interesting Amazon fish including the inevitable Piranha. A handling pool for children with starfish and other harmless and durable sea animals. Really quite a good experience and well suited to taking children for an hour's entertainment. For the Aquarist lots of interest but not coral reef specific which is fair enough. It's not as if you are in Florida or Queensland."
437,2.0,There were an amazing number of people crammed into the place it was difficult to really see the fish and around feeding times the crush to the front was too much so we left very disappointed. Clearly there is no such thing as too many paying customers.
438,3.0,For the ticket price we paid we had expected more. But it is the usual aquarium with a selection of fish and sea creatures. It is not that large and you can finish a walk around easily in half an hour. Again nothing special.
439,3.0,"I have been there twice. Last time i went i made the big mistake to go when there was a kids school field trip to the aquarium. Kids running and screaming everywhere kind of ruined the whole idea of going there. The aquarium itself is kind of nice when you get a chance to stop and look at everything, now its not the best but its not the worst i have seen. You can actually learn something if you get a chance to read the captions but the displays. So, all in all it was fun the first time i went but the second time i had a headache.. Scope out beforehand to make sure that you can actually see the marine life."
440,2.0,"coming from singapore, I found this place a little lame. the fishes are in tacky phone booths, mail boxes, traffic lights etc. explanations are in Korean and the kids got v little out of it.  if you have been to the SEA aquarium at Resort World Singapore, give this a miss. SEA is way better!"
441,4.0,"Prior to our visit to Lotte world, we head down to Coex Aquarium to see underwater sea aquarium! It was a pleasant visit and lots of interesting fishes and alike, including sharks, octopus, cute, colourful and funny shape fishes! There are lots of weird storage places where they place fishes in like refrigerator, washing machine, basin, sink, etc! Kids love it and definitely worth visit at such pricing... Around 15,000 won plus minus per person :-)"
442,4.0,"Coming from a region - Southeast Asia - which has awesome aquaria in the cities (Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur), this one is really not that great in comparison. Still, good for a visit, and entertaining enough."
443,5.0,"I visited this place on last Sunday and trust me it is amazing. You can see fishes everywhere like inside fridge, washing machine and even inside commode. There are a lot of variety of fishes available. To go there you can take subway. You should get down at Samseong Station (Subway Line No. 2). Exits no. 5 and no. 6 of Samseong Station are directly connected to the COEX Mall.  About Aquarium : If you are visiting this palace, you should take out atleast 2-3 hours of your busy schedule.Entry fee for Aquarium is 19500 KRW. It is situated on large area.  Following things you must do: - Please check feeding program timing, You will enjoy. - Fantastic part of visit is underwater tunnel safari. Below the shark. - You can also see many varieties of jelly fishes. Take a photograph of jelly fishes - Penguins activities.  To Eat : - There is some food is available outside Aquarium. You can try that on your own risk. It is good."
444,4.0,"COEX isn’t just all fish.. no they have a small “jungle” themed section with monkeys, tropical plants and elsewhere there are some prairie dogs chucked in for good measure. There are Beavers, penguins, dugong and chipmunks? (squirrels maybe), OH! And you will find fish in the fridge, washing machine, toilet bowl, kitchen skin, telephone booth and chilling with spider man! This section of unique places to hold a fish is referred to as the “Wonderland” and yes, COEX has thought of it all! I did a blog post on this attraction, its worth the visit but be mindful of long lines on busy days! http://rememberthefirst.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/coex-aquarium-seoul-south-korea/"
445,4.0,"Spent an afternoon at the Coex aquarium. Entry price is about US$18 for adult. While it's not the biggest aquarium in the world, it definitely has lots to see and offer. The best exhibit were the underwater tunnel and jelly fish display. The aquarium is located inside the Coex mall, so if you get tired from shopping, this would be a good place to relax."
446,5.0,"If u r looking for a place to shoot some photos in aquarium, this place is definately the one. I took lots of photos wit friends there :)"
447,4.0,It took us 1 hour to look around. It also had animals as well as sea creatures. It wasn't the greatest but a nice place
448,3.0,It was part of a tour and I didn't need it really. The aquarium is small compared to other world famous aquariums. Great set up for kids and schools. Great venue if you are vacationing with small kids.
449,5.0,Can honestly say this tops New York London Tokyo and Paris. Excellent and well thought out! The animals are in great condition and have tons of room!
450,4.0,"it worth that money and you can spend a good time there. there are different type of creatures, with different type of aquarium."
451,4.0,"Managed to do a 3 hour visit. Been to other aquariums such as Underwater world and Resort World's SEA aquarium. Personally, I feel that it is well managed as it is well divided into different eco systems for fishes (ie, Amazon, Ocean etc). Place is clean and exhibits are plenty. Downside of this is that the walk from the subway station is kinda far and confusing, though the species of fish are available in English, it can further improved by providing the description of species in English as well. Overall, still a nice place to visit!"
452,3.0,"It is an ok aquarium. I am from the States & have been to so many that in comparison to others Ive been to its just ok. I also think that they are a little high on the entrance fee but that could be because there are so many other great things to do in Korea that cost next to nothing if not free to do so it just seems high. Either way I think its high considering what you get & I would not pay it again. It was also very crowded the day we went & at a couple points it was so packed that you literally had to wait for the crowed to move so you could. But my kids enjoyed it & thats what mattered.  Let me say though that there are far far better things to do in Korea inside & outside that are awesome & way cheeper, do those if your having to choose between this or something else. Korea is such an amazing place that offers so much beauty all around & this is nothing special in my opinion because it doesn't give you a taste of the awesomeness that is Korea."
453,5.0,"I really enjoyed the aquarium. There were so many fish! Each was divided into simulated habitats and sections such as the amazon, upper - middle - lower freshwater river, and ocean (for example). There were even other creatures like flying squirrels and touch pools for children and adults to examine. The best was the underwater walkway where we could watch the sharks swimming around above our heads! It was a fun trip!"
454,5.0,"Given how many mums like to visit this place, it's way too stingy on its lift facilities.. We had to carry our phil and teds with two kids sleeping in it up at least 30 steps so in our second trip we demanded that the girls who work there help us and they let us use the wheel chair only lift.. Otherwise a great way to spend 2-3 hours looking at fishes, sharks and sting rays.."
455,4.0,Visited during peak season and although busy did not feel crowded and all features were easy to see! It's set out in geographical areas and whilst not massive the displays were plentiful varied and interesting! My son loved the penguins and sharks and I watched the turtles and manatees for ages! Seals Beavers and otters were delightful! A fun family day out and the imaginative displays were great!
456,3.0,"Visited Coex mall about 2 years back and was excited to return again. However, Coex was under some major reconstruction so most shops were sealed. The aquarium was okay. Explanations were mostly in Korean, even the penguin show commentary was in Korean with no English explanations. You'd see more river fishes, squirrels and small fishes and sharks. I have seen better aquariums elsewhere therefore, don't expect too much about the aquarium."
457,4.0,This was fun for my 6 year old son. There was a surprising variety of sea creatures. This is a must if you have kids and visiting Seoul. Well worth the entrance fee. The mall is also cool too. There is a Buddhist temple close by and tombs that are interesting to see.
458,3.0,"We went during Summer and korea is really HOT and humid during summer. Also they don't on air conditions indoors or even if they do, it's at its minimal so it is really stuffy indoors. we were sweating like pigs. Anyway, Coex was under some major reconstruction or something when we were there so most shops were sealed. The aquarium was okay. You'd see more river fishes, squirrels and small fishes and sharks. I'd say go during the cooler seasons and don't expect too much about the aquarium."
459,5.0,"We had no idea the COEX Aquarium would be so vast since it doesn't seem that large.  It also had a lot of sea life we hadn't seen anywhere else.  We thought the ~ 20,000 won admission price to be reasonable."
460,4.0,"My husband and I visited the aquarium on a Saturday afternoon and were surprised to find that the aquarium was by no means crowded. The price of admission was a bit high (19,500 won per adult) but they had a good variety of things to see displayed in a nice way. Even as two adults we easily spent over an hour and a half walking through it. They had a couple places where you could touch different sea creatures that looked fun for the kids. I'm not sure I'd pay the full price to go back again but it's a nice outing if you're looking for something fun to do inside for a couple hours."
461,4.0,"If you are reading this review trying to decide to go to the COEX Aquarium or not, GO. We drove from Yongsan to the COEX Mall (Aquarium) on a Saturday. Although parking at COEX was crowded, the odd thing was when we left the parking garage was almost empty. For a family of four, two adults, an 8 year and a 3 year old, we paid 54,000 won (not even a fraction of what you would paid at the Atlanta/Georgia Aquarium). We had a blast. This aquarium comes has everything you are looking for in an aquarium, including vending machines, a snack bar, and a gift shop at the end. Here's a tip - vending machines only take 1,000 won (not 5,000 or higher). We really enjoyed taking our time and enjoying all the exhibits. I read previous reviews and thought it would be a small aquarium, but we spent 2 1/2-3 hours inside. Highlights - underwater walk thru tunnel, the penguins feeding, and the open fish ponds. We will definitely visit this aquarium again!"
462,4.0,"The aquarium itself is not that big. At first we didn't actually expect much from it except that we had to do it because we had some kids with us. They have different themes like rainforest, etc. which is usual with most aquariums but they have a section where they use creative ideas to present the aquariums unlike the usual glass ones which we really find entertaining and funny. They also have a section just for toddlers and features like fish spa. We spent about 30 minutes inside and overall the kids enjoyed it."
463,5.0,"I am a regular aquarium attendee all over the world, so went long to the COEX Aquarium when I was feeling a bit down about how odd Seoul is for a westerner (my problem, not Seoul's). It cheered me up immensely. I totally loved all the quirky touches. The displays were clever and gorgeous. It was quite busy, but it didn't seem so, with lots of contemplative spaces. Most of the labels had English translations, but a few were missed. Please fix. Wonderful aquarium - well done!"
464,5.0,"It is one of interesting way to create aquarium I have ever seen. Price could be but lower but overall is OK. As practically everyplace in Seoul here as well there are lot of things to do for children. For me as for adult was interesting to found how interesting could be different view if Aquarium - like in the lamp, fridge etc. Enjoyed wildlife (animals) as well. There are interesting shows as well."
465,3.0,there was no crowds when we visit... at most like 20 visitor to the whole place So we had moment of peace seating down at one of the section watching the fishes swim in a relaxing mode. Could drop by if around the area or anyone who love the underwater world.
466,4.0,"The COEX Aquarium is in direct competition with the 63 Building Aquarium. However, it's newer and bigger (I think), so most people flock to the COEX. The entrance starts with some freshwater fish and reptiles and then the piece-de-resistance is the large aquarium with sharks and sea tortoises during feeding time when you get to see a diver go in and feed the fish!  The downside is that during peak times it can get crowded to the point that you can barely move let alone see the fish. The area gets very congested and stuffy, so I would advise going during off-peak hours. Off-peak hours I have found are right after the open and about two hours before closing.  Also, make sure to get your parking discounted!"
467,5.0,"There are many many varieties of fishes and other sea animals. Also has sharks, sting rays, giant turtles. Best part is the Aqua Tunnel at the end. It also has some good places to get pictures taken. Overall a very nice place to visit."
468,5.0,"good if u have an interest in biodiversity... sharks are the real attraction..situated in Coex mall.. Will take 2 hours minimum, 19500 fees"
469,5.0,"It's the only place where I saw manatees. They are huge and funny. You can watch them majestically swimming by or mouth-watering crunching on the cabbage. You will see different sharks, big octopus, fur seals and plenty of others animals and fishes. Some fish tanks will make you laugh, some others let you see the very details through a magnifying glass. The place is not big but well maintained and definitely worth a visit."
470,4.0,"I came here while visiting the Coex mall with my sister, brother in law and wife. We came on a weekend, using the subway. If you travel to the aquarium using the subway you will have to walk a very long way. Perhaps the aquarium is on the other side of the mall. I felt like we walked the entire length of the mall. It was very crowded at the entrance to the aquarium (perhaps this was also due to the weekend) and at first I was neither impressed or enjoying myself. After traveling up an escalator there is a room filled with some pillars that have some fish swimming around in them. The pillars are not that large and the fish were rather small. I initially thought to myself that this place was pretty lame.  However as we walked on further into the aquarium the displays became larger and more elaborate. Fish were given their own enclosures and they were more exotic. Farther along in the aquarium there was actually large sea animals such as stingrays and sea cows. I think there was also a random enclosure that held some monkeys. I am not sure why there were monkeys in the aquarium.  So, the first part of the aquarium was kind of a dud, but it certainly got better as you travel further into the aquarium. I would recommend coming here on a day when it is not so busy, you will have more time to look at the fish and not be pushed along by hordes of people. Nice place to go if you like fish and sea animals."
471,3.0,"If you are coming with the kids,they sure will like it.The location is at the basement of the shopping centre and the air seem isn't so refreshing.The space is small,morever when a lot of kids come together and running here and there,you find it is hardly to enjoy.However,the species of the fish is much better then i am expected,so it is still worth to come here if you are with kids in your group."
472,3.0,"When I saw the first set of fish tanks for the early sections of the aquarium, I was pretty disappointed. Being from the Midwest in the United States, you saw pretty much the same fish in the tanks that you'd see in any lake. They even had chipmunks at this aquarium. It was an odd combination of animals to put together. If I remember correctly too, there was a squirrel as well.  The place was still decorated with festive Christmas themed fish tanks, which were fun too see, but the thing I liked best were the very cleverly used phone booths, soda pop machines, traffic lights, Korean mail boxes, etc. that were used as fish tanks.  They also had an some manatees that were very active as well as many other sea creatures that were very enjoyable to see. The aquarium used its space pretty well, although like all places in Korea, it was VERY crowded and got really hot inside. I am not fond of the constant crowds that are frequently found in Seoul, especially when it's crowds of parents with their young children pushing strollers. I tend to refrain from it as much as possible when going anywhere in Seoul. So if you do happen to be there, I would recommend going when they open. So you can enjoy yourself better."
473,4.0,"I wouldn't say I'm much of an aquarium junky or anything, but this is the third time I've been to the COEX aquarium, but its the first time I've been with children. Friends of my wife and their kids came with us to the aquarium on a Saturday afternoon.  First, the aquarium was packed! Now, granted it was a Saturday afternoon in the middle of winter when there is not much going on, nor can you go outside to a park or anything, so I wasn't very surprised. That said, if you aren't a fan of crowds, I would avoid heading down on a weekend. I have been to the aquarium on a weekday, and its much more relax, with more time to stroll around and enjoy the sea life, as opposed to the weekends where it seems you are caught up in a wave of people that dictates your viewing experience.  The kids seemed entertained enough (Ages 9, two girls), but after about an hour of walking around the aquarium, they had enough and we left for ice cream. They had fun at petting section and when they could interact with the fish. Also, they loved the water show in the big tank.  Overall its a pretty good way to kill an hour at COEX while shopping at the mall. I will definitely go back again."
474,3.0,"I love aquariums and this one does not disappoint; however, it's not a great aquarium either. Watch out for weekends and holidays as this place can get crammed with kids whose idea of aquarium viewing is running around and banging on the glass."
475,4.0,I had a great time in this lovely aquarium. There were many fish varieties and the tanks were all lovely and clean and the animals looked happy.
476,2.0,"I was terribly disappointed by this aquarium. For fifteen bucks a person, it had one good tank towards the end of the route, but mostly everything else was a childish display of average-looking fish in what were meant to be unusual situations. Goldfish in a toilet bowl. Goldfish in a phone booth with mannequins. Goldfish in a diorama of a bedroom. Things that are meant to make the average visitor squeal and go ""How cute!"" but with no substance or overall design scheme behind it.  Go with your kids if they are easily amused, and if you don't care about the educational value of an aquarium. Not recommended for anyone over the age of five. Seoul Grand Park (the zoo) had a much better main tank, and it isn't even an aquarium!"
477,4.0,"If your legs are tired of exploring the huge mall, you can take a break and explore this unique aquarium. It starts off like a pop art museum, having those little fishes place inside a fridge,cupboard or even a vending machine as an aquarium.but as you move on,the aqua animals begin to get interesting. There are sharks,octopus,seals and even electric eels.very educative and visually exciting especially for kids."
478,3.0,"If you've been to other aquarium in Japan, this one is terribly small and not so impressive. Not worth the money! Entertaining for young children though!"
479,5.0,OHHH!! Amazing aquarium. I have not seen such a big one before. It has lots of see animals to see. It is for everybody. Do not miss this. Most of the attractions in Korea have discount for foreigners and Samsung employees. check it before taking ticket.
480,4.0,The place provides you opportunity to appreciate what's available in our oceans. The exhibits were well arranged with different themes. There is also a place that you can touch the starfish. Conveniently located in a convention centre and a mall.
481,3.0,"It is good, but did not understand what the hype was all about. Children will definitely enjoy it. But adults?? I dont think so. It is crowded and most of the fish are seen in other aquariums, so I did not find it very special. Even the staff there are ill-informed. The female near the entrance confirmed that camera were not allowed. But on going in, I see people with all types of cameras. Somewhere on a fish tank, a small label says flash photography is not to be taken. I would recommend to go here if you are absolutely free for that day."
482,3.0,"if you have been to the sydney aquarium or ocean park in hong kong, you will very likely be disappointed. the aquarium is really small and there is not very much that attract you. however, if this is the 1st aquarium that you are visiting in your life, you should give it a try."
483,3.0,"When you've visited other aquariums, such as Okinawa or Atlanta, this place does not measure up. It's small, has a fishy smell is a closed space, crowded, and is over priced. One good thing, there are a few different tanks (such as s soda machine) that are unique to the COEX aquarium. If it's a rainy day, with nothing to do, sure stop by and take a look. However I would not go out of my way to visit the COEX aquarium, save your time for something like Nanta or a place."
484,4.0,In is located inside of COEX Mall. Aquarium is not big but very interesting for children as well as for adult. It is better to come there in the morning - afternoon many people go there.
485,1.0,"I went there with my family (my mom and my sister), so the three of us were in the queue with many other adults who were bringing their children there. It might be a school holiday or something since we were there on a weekday but there were many many people around. But in any case, we were full of expectations knowing that this is the largest aquarium in Seoul. But once we were inside we were very disappointed. The place is small and cramped and full of people, mostly children, running here and there. The fishes were housed in tanks with magnifying effects so it got rather dizzy after a while. Maybe because there were too many people, but we were exhausted after jostling around with people for a while. Most of the exhibits were not very large, and the variety of fishes they had were not very fascinating. There was this portion where they housed fishes in ""exotic"" tanks like washing machines, fridges, sinks and toilet bowls (and this section was a big hit with children). It was a very sad sight for the 3 of us seeing the single lone fish swimming in the limited water the toilet bowl had to offer. There was a iguana exhibit too, but it was really too small for the beautiful creature. We soon came to this exhibit that featured turtles and there was a poor overturned turtle struggling with all its might to turn itself over. The sight of the poor turtle thrashing and writhing with all its might broke our hearts but there was no staff nearby, In fact, there is NO STAFF at all in that big place apart from the staff at the food stalls. We had to walk around the place before we found 2 staff (who look like they only provide directions) and we tried to tell them to help to turn the turtle over. This was very different from the other aquariums I've been to before where there would always be a staff beside each exhibit. The poor starfishes in the 'hands-on' area are also brutalised by the small children who pick them up and throw them back into the water (there's no staff again) The biggest tanks in this aquarium are not very big and pale in comparison to the ones I've seen. There was a penguin zone, but it was very small and somehow the penguins inside didn't look very happy. All but too soon, the visit ended. Yes, the place is really small.  All in all, I would say to visit this place only if you have small children as they would enjoy the hands on pool and the section where they place fishes in fridges etc. But for adults trying to learn more about the ocean and fishes, and who are looking for a educational and eye-opening experience, this place is not the place to go to. I personally felt that that the Osaka Aquarium Kaiyukan or Ocean Park Hong Kong were much better."

I went on Saturday about 1 pm and the reviews were right it was quite crowded but so is every attraction you would go to on a weekend. The Aquarium is located in a mall so not the average size Aquarium like they have in the States. Because there were so many people you walked through the aquarium in a line. If you are patient you will get your chance to get close and can take all the time you want to look. My favorite part was seeing how excited the little kids got in seeing the fish. There's a place where they have the Dr. fish and you can place your hands in and feel them nibble at the dead skin. You can also watch them feed the sharks, sea lions, penguins, etc. I enjoyed the touch tank where you can pick up the starfish. Even though it was crowded I enjoyed my time at the aquarium and thought the price was worth it. I had a smile on my face the entire time. If you have children I would definitely bring them here."
487,3.0,"We were a little disappointed in the fact that you had to pay quite a bit of money and it was so small and so crowed with people. It cost 17,500 for adults and 11,000 won for a child. We went on a weekend, which explains the crowd, but had a hard time enjoying it because you had to push your way through to see the tanks."
488,3.0,is a rather small aquarium which located in side a Mall. they offer touch pool which allow visitors to feel the sea creatures. it is fun and educational for the kids.
489,5.0,"This was recommended to us. It does not look like much from the mall entrance, but that certainly changed once we went through it. There was so many areas that contained so many fish and other animals. It was fantastic. They even had a `hand-on`area to feel starfish and other animals. Well worth the money."
490,3.0,"At first, We can't wait to go when we saw on the website that there will be shark feeding. Language can be a problem as signage in English are not everywhere. Staff giving presentation also spoke in Korean. Huge disappointment when we waited exciting for the shark feeding to start but there was no sight of diver n we saw a few pieces of the cabbage floating on water and the turtles were having a feast with them. Sight of sharks feeding - zero. Left my 4 year old in tears because he kept asking why the sharks are not feeding. I am waiting for my refund!!"
491,5.0,I took all my friends who vist Korea first time and I already been in Singapore ... Coex aquarium is bigger and neat then compare woth others
492,5.0,"Great place to take the family. Better to go during the week if you can, less busy."
493,3.0,"I'm not personally a huge fan of aquariums but the concept of one in a mall and the variety of animals that were present gave the outing at the mall a little extra sprinkle of fun. When with a friend, she mentioned it wasn't anything compared to an aquarium in Washington. So it appears that as far as aquariums go, this isn't one to be placed on an international ranking scale. Just a little extra at a very large and impressive mall in Seoul."
494,5.0,"I went there first when I was showing Seoul around to my boss's family from Singapore. Not only the 6 year old girl but everyone enjoyed the visit. Their display is not just on glass windowed fish tanks; they use refrigerator, cars and even washing machine! The Mrs. who have been to aquariums around the world with her kids said it was the best she's ever seen, and came back the next year with the younger kid. The aquarium is really big, so I suggest you take a break in the middle (where they have icecream stand). Otherwise, you will be too tired to enjoy the shows at the end. This place is also great for couples as you can talk a lot along the way and it is much fun to take photos."
495,3.0,"This aquarium does get very hectic, which might account for the lack of tidyness on the day we visited. Not all the animals or fish on display were displayed to their best. A bit crammed in and a disapointment after being told it was one of the best in Asia."
496,3.0,"I've been to a number of aquariums, this one is nice but nothing special, and a little pricey (no more expensive than others, but unlike most of Korea, this isn't any cheaper than other aquariums across the globe)"
497,5.0,"It is located inside the mall, and easy to do in an hour or two."
498,4.0,"One of the things that I find interesting about the country of Korea is how expensive and inexpensive things are in this country. The Aquarium is a great example. 17,000 won for an adult ticket for an Aquarium in a mall was crazy, I thought at first. But it is a very big and very nice aquarium. Signs in English and Korean were very informative. The whole place felt very small, yet we were in the place for 3 hours. The tanks were really interesting because of the optical illusion of seeing underwater and above water at the same time. It was really cool at the otter tank. The creatures would play and fight, and from out vantage point it looked like 4 otters when it was only 2. So, great visuals, great exhibits ( the fruit bat cage was hilarious.), and only a few "" Nemo"" like murals. So it was worth the price of admission. The parking price at the mall seemed a bit much, but like all things in Korea; sometimes you pay too much for very little, and sometimes you pay a little for a lot."

500,4.0,Was a pretty good sized aquarium. Bring your walking shoes. Lots of fishes.
501,4.0,"We actually just stumbled across the aquarium while visiting the mall. I must say, it was really good. We enjoyed it much more than any other aquarium that we have visited. There was also several school classes there on a field trip, they kids made it even more enjoyable because they were so eager to talk to us and be social. We spent a couple hours at the aquarium and also caught an IMAX show while we were there as well. It is a very fun day and we would recommend it to any visitor to Seoul."
502,3.0,"Expensive for what it is, very difficult to find in the COEX centre. However it is still a treat for children under 10."
503,5.0,"To see Coex aquarium takes 2 hours. Is a wonderful place to visit while in Seoul. Part of a large mall, the aquarium covers freshwater as well as marine life. Sharks, Penguins, seals, arowanas, a turtle with 2 heads.... costs 15500 wons. must see while in Seoul"
504,4.0,"Located in the COEX mall, the aquarium is a good reason to go at all. Well planned out, you will find a wide variety of marine life. There are some examples of some really unique fish tanks, a tank in which the Surgeon fish can get up close and personal with your hand, and even some reptiles for you to enjoy. Go during the week if possible, the mall and aquarium is much less crowded and more enjoyable. If you take your time and stop to enjoy the very wide variety of fish, amphibians, reptiles and many other animals, it should take about a half hour from start to finish."
