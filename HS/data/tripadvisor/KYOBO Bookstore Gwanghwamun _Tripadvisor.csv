2,Kevin Tan,5.0,"The giant Kyobo Book Store in Gwanghwamun stocks great books, music and stationery. For those of you who still music in palpable form, the Hottracks concessionaire has an amazing collection of CDs, DVDs and LPs. Its classical collection is particularly impressive and it stocks many hard-to-find CDs and LPs of Korean classical artistes like Kun Woo Paik and Yeol Eun Son. Its English books selection is small but well stocked. It also has an incredible array of stationery concessionaires who stock a great collection of fountain pens, inks, papers, notebooks and stationery you never thought you needed. For those who are into personalised music, there is an extensive selection of headphones and bluetooth streaming devices. You could spend a whole day there since there is also a restaurant and cafe within the bookstore itself.","Written November 28, 2019"
3,Brooke C,5.0,"Kyobo is a chain, so there are stores all over Seoul, but the Gwanghwamun location is my favorite. They sell books and CDs, which reminds me of what the States used to have in the Borders chains, along with even more stuff. There are cafes and restaurants inside, too. There are sections for foreign languages and, depending on your language, there are likely specialty shops elsewhere that will better serve you. The English section is small, but has great editions, like Oxfords World’s Classics, at cheap prices. The literary selection tends to be canonical, but the staff also has a large section devoted to best-sellers and newly published material, most of which is non-fiction, that is a sort of Korean-American cultural filter. There are always lots of families here and people milling about, reading, gathering books, enmeshed in the written word and the real world. Take some time here, slow down, observe, read something, think a few connected thoughts, have something to eat or drink...and enjoy.  Over the past five or six years, there has been lots of renovation in the areas adjacent, particularly with high end restaurants and shops behind Kyobo and to the left. Jongno has remained the same and the Gwanghwamun Gwangjang is historical. Several years ago the Korean people protested then President Park Geun-Hye with candlelight vigils and songs on the square, every Saturday, for months. These protests began with small numbers that grew into the thousands, and arguably millions. These protests were part of the success in the removal of Park (December, 2016) and were amazing representations of the civil, non-violent assemblage of people for a cause. Democracies around the world would do well to follow in these Korean footsteps.","Written August 22, 2019"

5,Deborah W,5.0,"Kyobo bookstore in Jongno-gu (near Gwanghwamun station) is a must-visit for anyone with a passion for books and simply spending time in bookstores. This particular branch (there are others dotted around the city) is, I believe, the largest. It has a vast collection of books in Korean, and sections for a number of other languages, with quite a good selection of books in English. The store also has a stationery section, puzzles and a cafe, and is surrounded by a number of other shops. Unlike so many bookstores these days, Kyobo allows you to spend time simply sitting on the provided comfortable benches, and reading. You'll find the store in the basement, accessible from the station.","Written May 25, 2019"

For stationary materials, it is better and cheaper to enter smaller shops specific for stationary. You will lose much less time. Same is valid for other goods such as souvenirs, wallets, bags, toys, etc. If you want to buy only book and have specific list, enter and buy. Otherwise you can become crazy in crowd.

As I was pressed for time, I went to the designated location but was too overwhelmed andI decided to ask their Book Concierge Counter for assistance.

11,Choo-Beng G,5.0,I stumbled on this while walking out of the Gwanghwamun subway station and was amazed at the range of books and local crowd on a Sunday morning. The English section is located on a corner closer to the cafe. It is one of the largest I have seen in Seoul as English books are not common. Especially for literature on Korean art and culture published by the national cultural institute. There is also a comprehensive list of titles published by Tuttle books on Korean national identity and history. There are also titles on the Korean War as well as current works on North Korea. The store also has a nice cafe and sections devoted to stationery and fine writing instruments. I wish there would be more such stores in Singapore as this reflects the knowledge seeking identity of a nation and I am happy that print is still king in some places.,"Written October 26, 2018"

One of the main reasons was to buy the same book in Singapore, it cost almost three times as much as the amount I paid in Korea.

There are also many other things available from jewellery to dolls to music/cds and lots more, too many things to even remember. There is also a wonderfully clean toilet available plus a mothers room. A restaurant and a coffee/juice shop is also there with a fairly large amount of seating.

24,p911turbo,4.0,"This place is more than a book store. It is more like a mini-shopping center where you can find not only stationery, books, electrical appliances, gadgets but also toys and bags (Hottracks is inside too). They provide small benches here and there for customers who like to linger around for a little bit. If you are hungry, there is a food court.  The store is definitely an excellent place to fend off the afternoon heat and torrential rains. It could get really crowded because of that and also the fact that it is connected to the subway. I have also been to the one in Daegu, too. The Daegu store is smaller and not as crowded.  If you decide to do some serious shopping there, make sure that you bring your passport with you for the instant tax returns / credits (spending 30000 won at one time). It would be nice if they have a coffee shop there, just like the one in Barnes and Noble.","Written August 11, 2017"

From Gwanghwamun metro station you just need to follow the directions because the bookstore also located underground near the station. They have wide range collections of book. Mainly, of course in Korean but their imported or foreign language book sections are okay and quite satisfying. For K-Pop lovers, you can explore the CD and music sections to get the latest K-Pop albums. Korean art-supply store, ARTBOX also available inside the Kyobo. ARTBOX and Kyobo have great collections of office supplies, stationery, and cute stuffs so don't forget to check them out. You can stuff yourself as cafes and restaurants also available with full selections of food. In conclusion, this place is just amazing and definitely time killer!

Unfortunately, I feel that with the passing of time the foreign book section is subtly becoming smaller and smaller... but nevertheless, it's still the best choice to browse through and buy books.  If you are to frequent your visits to the bookstore or if you live in Seoul, I'd recommend getting a Kyobocard for benefits and discounts.

29,MoseyOn,5.0,"Who doesn't love a good bookstore? The Kyobo Bookstore has been around since . . .well, forever, it seems, and it still pulls me in every time I visit Seoul. The selection of books in Korean is vast, but there is also a very good selection of books in English, both fiction and non-fiction. I never have any difficulty finding something. But even if you are not in the mood to buy, this is an excellent place to kill some time.  They have increased the floor space devoted to things like stationery and gifts over the years, but books are still at the heart of what they offer. The stationery section is substantial, and anyone should be able to find something here, from Moleskine notebooks to cutesy pens to everything in between. There is also a mini food court in the corner where I had a surprisingly good bowl of bibimbap (stainless steel bowl, sadly, not stone).  There are lots of places to sit in the book area, and pretty much every one one of them was filled with someone reading a book (or doing something on their phone). I can't say how many books were being bought (except the ones I bought), but there was certainly a lot of reading activity going on. The vibe in the Kyobo Bookstore is always a lively one. It has a good feel, a good selection of books and other merchandise, and a good location. Check it out.","Written April 7, 2017"

There are lots of seats around the bookstore and it can get pretty packed, but the place is never rowdy or annoyingly noisy, maybe because very the bookstore is very spacious with always enough space for everyone.

As i'm a part time student so i naturally have a soft spot to their cute monthly calendars, stickers, korean cartoon related stationery, pens, etc. they are good for souvenirs if you have friends who are still studying or working in office.  Especially in the chilling autumn weather, Kyobo also sell heatpack at 500won each (~SGD $0.60) and this could last about 10 hours. as a tropical kid, i really cannot stand cold weather, so i bought 10 packets of heatpack at one shot. ^ ^ the cashier did look at me strangely though..  *i seriously think korea heatpack is much larger, warmer & better than those i bought from Singapore Daiso.

Bookstores are a dying industry, at least where I live, so it's truly nice to be in a place with stacks and stacks of books covering a wide range of topics.

Restrooms and water fonts are clean and big - as they usually are in Seoul, actually. And, what surprised me the most, there's a quite small food court, but very efficient, with a little more than a dozen choices of dishes, my friend and I tried some of them and they were all delicious! There's also a baskin robbins for some dessert, a dunkin' donuts and some coffee shop I don't remember which.

Most of these are usually not available on Amazon or other online bookstores.  Kyobo's outlet at Gwanghwamun didn't disappoint. It's large and sprawling, but most of the books are Korean, which is to be expected. As with most brick and mortar bookstores these days, they have cafes, retailers selling pens, art supplies, bags and others to provide some added attraction.  They have a respectable English cookbook collection, but also a selection of books on Korean topics in English. There were some locally written cookbooks, and they looked interesting because several of them were written by well known culinary academics. When I was there in November, they had a promotion on Japanese books and you can enjoy a discount on them. They had also put up a nice display featuring a mix of Japanese cookbooks. I really like this feature.  What I enjoyed about the bookstore was the chairs and benches they had provided within the store to allow people to browse their selections. There are staff there who speak simple English. They have a green practice of charging for carrier bags (which is good).  I'd go back there to check out the cookbooks again. Kyobo is more like Eslite in Taipei (another fabulous bookstore) in its offerings of books and other related products. Kinokuniya in Tokyo is more like the traditional bookstore with a lot more focus on providing books and less on other goods. All are great bookstores, and deserve visits by book lovers.","Written December 1, 2015"

Like pretty big...huge. If you've ever seen a Virgin Records store or similar, that's what I would compare Kyobo to. I don't speak the language, but that's okay. I just visited to be around books--and there were many! The stationery portion is way better than I've seen in any Barnes & Noble in the U.S. It has items for kids and ""grown up crayons"" for adults. They even had an art section with oil paints, luxury counters selling special writing tools (Mont Blanc, Parker, Faber-Castell), and other mini-vendors selling accessories. I saw a plethora of headphones from Shute, personal speakers from Ultimate Ears, and nice sales as well. The prices are out of this world great, and customer service was levels above what I've seen in most stores in any country. For instance, I was approached quite a few times with a basket to unload all the trinkets I'd been collecting in my hands. I will definitely be going to the Kyobo in Gwanghamun, but one shouldn't rest in their laurels to see the one in Gangnam.

Obviously 60% of the bookstore is made by Korean titles, but even then, the English and other languages sections are well fed. Besides, there is a incredible huge stationery section with plenty of notebooks ( with much more diversity than the sheer Moleskine you find in any bookstore); and the Hot tracks, a CD and DVD store.  It is a pity this bookstore is in the basement of a massive building and not facing the street. Besides, the signalling to get to the bookstore is virtually non existent.  But anyhow, a very recommendable stop in a very central location in near the palace Gyeongbokgung.","Written January 8, 2015"
57,Paul K,5.0,Gotta conpare the size to Barnes and Noble back home...this place is huge and has it all! I usually go to the kyobo bookstore in Jamsil station which is great too!,"Written November 11, 2014"
58,TheDongo,5.0,"The sheer size of this place is amazing huge! It has all kinds of books, ststionary and everything else you would expect to find in a bookstore.  If you love books you have to come here!  My problem was that when I was there no one spoke English, even the lady who was stationed at the English speakig desk couldn't spwak English.  And the prices are a bit high. Otherwise it is the place to buy books in Korea!","Written October 13, 2014"
59,Mesy,5.0,"If you are ""Books & Stationary Lover"", don't miss this place. There are a lot of books & stationary to buy. All of the stationary are good quality and not expensive. A lot of cute & lovely things to bring back home.","Written August 5, 2014"
60,wengya,5.0,Huge bookstore with a large English section. Lots and lots of nice stationery. There are also cafes and food outlets within the bookstore. Enjoyable experience.,"Written June 14, 2014"
61,ji_tera,5.0,"There's definitely not enough signs for the bookstore from the outside, but it definitely worth looking for (underground). Plenty of books in foreign languages and wide variety of stationery brands. Awesome bathroom too =)))","Written May 20, 2014"
62,vamsally,4.0,"This is by far the most popular and well known bookstore in Korea. It takes up an entire lower floor of a building. If you don't read Korea, they do have a huge selection of Korean to English and other language translated section.","Written May 31, 2013"
