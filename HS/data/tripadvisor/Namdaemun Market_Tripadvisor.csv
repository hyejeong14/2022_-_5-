0,Traveller of the world,3.0,I am not one for markets. I came as it is apparently one of the largest and that it certainly was! We got lost. Local junk. There was nothing good apart from the odd boutique jewellery store. Nice to see the locals and absorb the atmosphere. Some parts were not that clean.,"Written May 30, 2022"

There are red angels ( tourist ambassadors in red uniform) standing at major intersections for questions. Great place to get a flavor of local culture.","Written May 14, 2022"

4,DanN1969,5.0,"I could spend days browsing through Seoul's famous Namdaemun Market, because they have everything, and it's Korean style. All from souvenirs, through food, snacks and beverages to wholesale. And all the way through, you meet smiling people. If you don't have days to spend there, at least give it a try of a few hours, it's worth it. And one more thing; It's clean, nice and clean and nice. Don't miss it if you're in Seoul.","Written March 5, 2020"
5,Janet1016,4.0,"My husband, son and I visited Seoul, South Korea for the very first time the end of January. Our Hotel, the Tmark Grand Hotel, was within walking distance of the Namdaemun Market and we visited it numerous times over the course of the week we were there.  I'm not a big shopper but I am a foodie and we ate in a couple of restaurants in the Market as well as sampling some of the street foods and I also purchased some Honey Butter Almonds, which are a very popular foodie souvenir to buy when in South Korea, at a lower price than if you go to an actual shop that specializes in them (of which there are MANY). :)  I love Night Markets. Coming from Canada I can't get enough of them when I visit Asia. Everything looks so FOREIGN! LOL! I saw all manner of fresh fruits for sale, spices, clothing, foodie treats, and much, much more.  The Market, which is the largest traditional Market in South Korea, has over 10,000 vendors, retailers and wholesalers. It is a dense maze of stalls and restaurants. One night while we were looking for a spot to get some dinner we came out of a back alley to be faced with a stunning Old City Gate right across the street which turned out to be Sungnyemun Gate, South Korea's #1 National Treasure. You honestly never know what is going to be around the next corner.  Merchants have been selling items near this location since 1414 AD!!!!! There is an information booth with people in it that do speak some English which is super helpful. They also have free maps so you can orient yourself. We went to the Information booth one evening for a restaurant recommendation and were pleased.  Just go wander.....it's uber fun!","Written February 27, 2020"
6,Culinary-Consultants,5.0,"Dear colleague travelers, here I leave you a review for the one and only market worthy of a visit in Seoul: The Namdaemun Market. Filled with excitement, strange and curious things, lots of interesting street food, raw food ingredients, music, clothing, souvenirs and its booming with people.  Still the rule of South Koreans is not to understand a word of English; but in this market like everywhere in South Korea; be ready for price rise as soon as they see you coming and being a non-Korean. Speculation is in the air.  Most of the things you'll be able to buy when it comes to clothing and souvenirs; is cheap worthless Chinese crap. But concentrate on the raw products and on the street food. At least prices are exposed and the prices are the same for foreigners and locals alike.  Just walk around (watch your pockets) as there are some suspicious persons in the area. Don't spend much (you will be tempted) but remember most of the souvenirs globally are cheap Chinese products that you'll end up throwing away.  In Korea you need to concentrate on walking a lot as there is plenty to walk, take fresh air, don't spend on garbage, have some curious food and the points of Interest are to be museums, palaces and all related to this activities. (museums and monuments, places, etc are really cheap). This is my advise.  We recommend this market as the ONLY one worth. The rest is just copy and paste.","Written February 1, 2020"

Go to Gwangjang Market if you are looking for some street foods, Go to Myeongdong if you are planning to do some shopping. Worth a visit if you are trying to get yourself a new pair of glasses, but you will probably be overcharged if you are a foreigner. Bring one of your Korean friends.

Because I fly through ICN a number to times a year, when I have a long enough layover, would head into the city for a quick hike and revisit of the market.  Have been quite disappointed the last 3 visits this year. The same vendors that were friendly and smiling are no longer. And have become short and abrupt.  The first time, I chalked it up to an off day. We all have those. But 3 times within 6 months, don't think it is a coincidence anymore.  I don't know if it is because they have become tired of tourists or something else. But it leaves a bad impression and I won't go back.

Right at the exit is a fruits and vegetable store that selling items at wholesale price.. At least the strawberries I bought there is way cheaper (& sweet!!) than in Myeongdong and all other areas. (Imagine 6000krw at Namdaemun vs 12000-20000krw for a pack of 32 strawberries selling elsewhere.)  Walk down the streets and get the street food first.. Solely window shop down the street..

We settled on Polaris Spectacles shop where we found the English- speaking Mr Kim to be very patient and attentive.

Also, if you want to practice your haggling skills then this is a good place to start. (Don’t haggle food though; however, don’t me nervous about asking for a big portion.)  I’ve come here with family or friends, but keep the little ones close because there is a lot of hustle/bustle taking place.  Since it is a traditional style market, try some food you’ve never eaten before. I discovered cow lungs mixed with spicy red sauce and rice is delicious.  This is a great place to buy cheap clothes for kids. Also, the silky grandma pants are wild looking and comfortable. I got 2 pair for 5$ once.  I wouldn’t take kids here at night, but Seoul is very safe. There might be a lot of drunks singing at the moon, and if you fancy getting drunk and shopping, then by all means shop here.  If visiting Korea, then this is wayyyyyyy more of a “korean” experience as opposed to doing something mundane like visiting Seoul Tower.  Like I said—-explore. Go in buildings. Walk around.

69,don s,5.0,So there is the day time shopping and night time shopping. If your looking for kids clothes you can come after 10pm to 5am. On #6 you can find many kids clothing stores. The key to getting a discount is buy more than one piece. I think the minimum is 3 and up. So we bought on this trip maybe 9 of the same kids sleep sack different colors and sizes to give to friends and it was much cheaper. For example a kids hat I bought was 15000won each but if I buy more than 3 it’s 9000won. If I buy three I save 3000won and get 3 hats! Anyway this is the deal and for accessories you need to buy by the dozens and many styles. The last time I came I bought hairpins for my kids and friends. They come out to 50cents each very cheap. There is usually less people at night and this is when the wholesale customers come so just be aware to get deals you must buy more. Also make sure you bring cash.

96,Mike M,1.0,"Maybe it was because I visited Nandaemun on a weekday evening, maybe it’s because I’d just come from Taiwan where the night markets are world-renowned, but this is a very unremarkable market selling a limited selection of food.  Besides fixed shops offering baked goods and pigs’ feet, there are stalls selling skewers which average about 3,000-5,000 won. Each stall sells almost exactly the same selection at almost the same price. There are alleyways off the main streets in which you can find sit-down restaurants selling the usual Korean fare - bulgogi, noodles, cuttlefish etc. I went into one of these and had spiced cold noodles with boiled egg.  From the stalls I had rather some chewy octopus skewers and average chicken skewers, some bland fried shrimp and a nondescript sugared dumpling. I wouldn’t repeat the experience.  Overall I was really disappointed. Having lived in China I came expecting a high standard of street food but this was nothing to write home about. I have seen much better markets in very rural areas of other parts of Asia, so I was surprised at just how uninspiring this one was given that Seoul is such a large and international city. In fact I would venture to say it’s the worst market I’ve ever been to.  As for the products for sale, they are primarily Supreme imitation hoodies and other paraphernalia, and trinket shops. I can’t say I find that kind of thing interesting but if you do you might enjoy that side of the market.","Written June 12, 2019"

Even if you dun know how to order/eat, just observe the locals and follow what they do.  Besides food, there are many stalls selling imitation branded stuff. Some are such bad fakes- the words Tommy Hilfiger printed on a hoodie with another Brand’s logo. Reminds me of night markets in Bangkok.

I would recommend seeing the fish part of the market, and the food stalls. At the end of our walkabout, we saw this food cart with a queue. As everyone in the queue was Korean, we thought it must be good so lined up not knowing what exactly they were queuing for. 15 minutes later we bought two deep fired veggie pancakes for 2,000 KRW - about £1.40. We walked up to Sungnyemun Gate and tucked into them. They were absolutely fabulous.","Written November 17, 2018"
188,Rumples,5.0,"I stayed near this traditional market during a recent visit to Seoul and visited three times. Huge, the place has eight numbered gates; more than 10,000 stores in buildings and stalls; merchandise ranging from flowers to military equipment; and food carts. It seems to be the liveliest in the morning, when I encountered thick crowds, and rather quiet in the late afternoon. The market obviously attracts shoppers, based on the transactions I saw taking place, but also visitors with cameras, soaking up the atmosphere and enjoying photo ops.  I went for the atmosphere but ended up returning to seek out inexpensive souvenirs, such as bookmarks and fans. Though I looked at other items, including clothing and accessories, nothing appealed. Much better quality can be found in nearby department stores but with higher prices.  My favorite part of the market proved to be the ubiquitous food carts, where vendors prepare all kinds of yummy-looking fare. I finally got in a long line waiting for a hotteok (deep-fried veggie pancake) by Gate 2. It took about 20 minutes before I could put my order in and I received the hotteok almost immediately. The cost was 1,000 KRW, about $1 U.S. I stood on the street, eating this tasty delight and savoring every bite.  It is easy to get lost in this complex of pedestrian streets and buildings, so I suggest getting a map from the market's information kiosk before starting to explore. Enter from Gate 2 at Namdaemun-ro or Gate 5 at Toegye-ro. The kiosk stands on the street that connects the two gates, near the souvenir shops.  Namdaemun Market is easily accessed by subway (lines 1, 2, 4) and many bus lines. It takes about 15 minutes to walk there from Seoul Station.","Written November 17, 2018"

There are people everywhere, shop owners are shouting about the items they are selling to those who might be interested, and deliverymen are swerving in and out of the crowds.

I had a local Korean friend with me and we had to ask about 4 people. It was kind of fun to find because it is literally hidden. I would recommend using a maps app and not giving up. Once you do find it take a seat at any of the many soup stalls. You’ll be knocking elbows with fellow eaters. There’s no way around this due to the very small space and high demand of the food served. The alley is only about 20 yards long. Most stalls serve soup noodles and bibimbap. When you’re finished, pay and leave. There will probably be people literally standing behind you waiting their turn. This is an “only in Seoul” type of experience.

Most of the vendors here are selling the same things, so shop around, compare the price, and try to negotiate. Most importantly, have fun!

There's a road with stores selling stationery, wrapping paper and gift bags that had pretty attractive options.

I have not seen this Korea food being offered in other places while i was visiting Seoul and Busan during my 9 day trip in June 2018, so i suppose that this might be the only place easiest to find for such a type of Korea specialty.  This fish dish is so popular that there was even 2 alley within the Namdaemum market dedicated to selling this dish. With many shops offering almost the same time, you would just need to look for one that would seem to be the most popular.  As there was no English signboards for most of the shops, we simply resorted to pointing at what the other tables were having and we were not disappointed.  My family of 3 person order 1 portion of Hairtail Fish and 1 portion of Fried Assorted Fish which came with some free side dishes such as pickles, beans, Eggs, and fried fish and rice. Iced water is always provided free at the table as well.  But do note that this fish does have quite abit of bones and the stew is mildly spicy. But overall, i think this is a perfect cuisine if you want to try something typical of this market.

Be sure not to buy them at Doota. There is also another mall that sells just clothes for adults. It’s hard to give directions as they are like hidden gems amongst the many street stalls. If u happen to be in the mall selling jewelry, don’t be alarm if the stall owners refuse to sell single pieces to you. They are for bulk purchases and pre-order.

At times you're blocked but people, hardly able to move forward or backward, neither left or right... and in parts underground.  I enjoy observing the hustle and bustle of people and browsing for a typical Joann item (like brass dishes or similar)  Generally it's mostly about clothing, but my size is never available neither my style.  Very close by for larger wallets the first Shinsegae hosting upscale designer boutiques and a nice food section in B1  On the other end of the market, the name giving Nandaemun, the former city gate and national treasure No.1 ( it sadly burned down ca. 10 yrs ago, but was restored to it's full glory)  All in all go and visit as it's truly any experience!","Written May 14, 2018"

Maybe we just went to the wrong places to eat.  We ventured to explore Namdaemun market in front of our hotel in the last few days of our trip. We were not disappointed! It was a tourist haven. Food was cheap, authentic and delicious. So much variety. I loved the huge dumplings! It was the best! Bang for every buck!  You can also shop for cheap stuff in the market. There were a lot of winter clothes on sale, street food and a lot of souvenirs. My best buy was the Rimowa looking luggage set (Small, Medium and Large) for only P 9,000 or about USD 180.

I had to give them an uncomfortable look and just pull my arms from them, i was so nervous to even look closely to the items sold there cos they can be grab u by the arms and its hard to let loose. ( NOT COOL)  The items sold there isnt any unique either, cos u can find similar items at myeondong underground shopping, or the street.

There are many wholesale retailers there selling great varieties of items like fashion and home products, etc. As for food wise, I don’t see a great variety of food. We bought some red bean buns but didn’t finish them off. We ended up in a restaurant near exit 5 for our lunch.

401,Patrick C,1.0,"My friend and I wanted to have a quick bite after dinner before going back to hotel to end the day. We went to the back street of Marriott Courtyard Namademum hotel where we stayed and decided to opt for one of the food tents to have the local experience, particularly we saw a number of local Koreans were having meal there. So we thought that having many locals in there should be a good sign for taste, price or both. Since we just wanted to have a quick bite so we only ordered 3 dishes, chicken skewers, chicken heart skewers, and boiled octopus.  However, to our surprise, we were charged KRW 45,000 which was absurdly overpriced. We had paid less for each of our many delicious meals in proper restaurants before, such as seafood steamed pot for 2 people (KRW 43,000)and ginseng chicken soup for 2 people. (KRW 40,000). So there is absolutely no reasonable explanation to charge such high price for simple food in non- proper rest restaurant (or a tent). The only reason is that those tents are targeting tourists.  To be honest, I am quite willing to spend money on food particularly when I am travelling but I feel upset because I have the feeling of being cheated. If you don’t want to leave a bad taste in your travelling experience in Korea, then please just don’t go to food tents in Seoul.","Written December 21, 2017"

Namdaemum covers a few city blocks with a few main streets and a lot of alleys. I found that the whole area is quite confusing. Most of the stores and vendors sell similar things: clothing, handbags, socks, street food, produce etc. It is difficult to find a landmark. If you happen to find the information booth, get a site map and it helps to navigate the area.  We visited the area on a Saturday afternoon, Surprisingly it was not too crowded. May be it was their National holiday week. We had a hand-made noodle lunch at a tiny alley which is near the information booth. The space of that vendor is really tight and it can only seat 4 people. For US$5, you are served with kimchi, 1 bowl of cold noodle and 1 large bowl of hot noodle soup. The noodle lady was very friendly and she refilled the kimchi once we finished. The noodle was very good.  A few days later, we visited again on a week day around 5:30pm. a lot of the vendors have already closed and only those along the main street were still open. So if you plan to visit, choose a day visit on the weekend.  I didn't see any public washroom in the area","Written October 19, 2017"
