0,0,34,If you're staying in the heart of the city in Seoul don't go to this mall go to the CoEx Mall. This mall had a higher rating and it took 40 minutes to get here by taxi üò¢ it was definitely overrated and I couldn't believe I had almost leave the city to get here.,0,took
1,1,51,"Read about this new largest mall in Seoul, so decided to check it out. It took about 25 minutes by Korea Rail/Metro to get there from City Hall station. It's main anchor tenant is Shisegae and that is the first building you notice across the road when you step out of the Yeongdeungpo station. It is not directly connected (at least I could not find the underground link) so it might be difficult to get to and from the station when it rains.  It also has a large ecopark whe you can sit in fine weather to have a quick lunch. I loved the huge Emart store spread across two floors in the basement, which sells everything from groceries and beers to car accessories and home linens, and everything in between it seems.  There are also the usual brand names you can find in any mall, such as LV and Coach, as well as high street stores like Charles & Keith and H&M. If you are hungry, you can have Mexican food at South of the border, burgers from Lotteria and KFC, Japanese ramen and Viet noodles, and many more.  I enjoyed visiting the pet and flower shops at the end close to Emart, where there were several puppies for sale.  As mentioned before, it is quite a distance from town, but you can make a day of it by exploring the streets of Yeongdeungpo anto see how the locals go about their daily routines.",1,took
