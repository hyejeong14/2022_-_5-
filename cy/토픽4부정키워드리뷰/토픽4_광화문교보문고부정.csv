They sell books and CDs, which reminds me of what the States used to have in the Borders chains, along with even more stuff. There are cafes and restaurants inside, too. There are sections for foreign languages and, depending on your language, there are likely specialty shops elsewhere that will better serve you. The English section is small, but has great editions, like Oxfords World’s Classics, at cheap prices. The literary selection tends to be canonical, but the staff also has a large section devoted to best-sellers and newly published material, most of which is non-fiction, that is a sort of Korean-American cultural filter. There are always lots of families here and people milling about, reading, gathering books, enmeshed in the written word and the real world. Take some time here, slow down, observe, read something, think a few connected thoughts, have something to eat or drink...and enjoy.  Over the past five or six years, there has been lots of renovation in the areas adjacent, particularly with high end restaurants and shops behind Kyobo and to the left. Jongno has remained the same and the Gwanghwamun Gwangjang is historical. Several years ago the Korean people protested then President Park Geun-Hye with candlelight vigils and songs on the square, every Saturday, for months. These protests began with small numbers that grew into the thousands, and arguably millions. These protests were part of the success in the removal of Park (December, 2016) and were amazing representations of the civil, non-violent assemblage of people for a cause. Democracies around the world would do well to follow in these Korean footsteps.",3,long

But also there is an unspeakable number and shape of post it and other sorts of stickers which I also find amazing along with the kids. Staff is friendly and helpful. There is a restaurant there, if you get hungry after having browsed all the stuff. Every time I come to Korea I visit the bookstore, I like it this much.",4,long
5,5,231,"The selection of English fiction has greatly improved but still has a long way to go before it will compare with an English speaking country. It does however have a really wide selection of Teaching materials for various languages. The stationery variety available is unbelievable. Whatever your heart desires you will find here. There are also many other things available from jewellery to dolls to music/cds and lots more, too many things to even remember. There is also a wonderfully clean toilet available plus a mothers room. A restaurant and a coffee/juice shop is also there with a fairly large amount of seating. All in all, it is somewhere you can happily spend an afternoon. You will also find many students sitting there reading books they can't afford to buy.",5,long
