Yes, you can purchase ""street foods"" and sit in the dining hall to consumer, or peruse the limitless items in the grocery to take home to cook yourself. Either way, foodies will love this place -- though we have found prices of identical grocery items to be a bit less expensive at the Shinsegae Department Store a few blocks away.",1,almost

Do note that some items in the duty free are much higher than what you can get for them in other stores like Shisegae, so shop around.  We loved the food court and supermarket in the basement though, and it had almost everything imaginable from vegetables to cakes and sauces and fruits, We bought a couple of punnets of strawberries for 8000 won each and they were sweet and ripe.",2,almost
3,3,195,"I have to say that the entire Lotte World is not well designed. Maybe because I am a foreigner, I am used to things being designed for the masses, where everything that can go wrong, will go wrong, so you try to make things idiot proof for the first time visitor. Like, this whole complex, the department store, the amusement park, etc, are all integrated into downtown Seoul. Not the city center, but a side city, Songpa-gu. In other words, Lotte World is the majority of Songpa-gu. That being said, it is hard to figure out where Lotte World begins, and where it ends. There is no guidance on where to go. It is just there. Park somewhere, figure it out. No shuttles, no monorails, no people to tell you where to go. Just start walking and figure it out. But this is true of all of South Korea. All of the signs inside, like where to find the bathroom or this or that, only get you half way there. Seriously, you will follow a sign, and then there is no sign, and the thing you are looking for is nowhere to be found. It is the most frustrating thing I have encountered. It is almost like they said, we'll do you a favor, but not really. And that could not be worse in a city where the temperature and the humidity both hover around 90. You will need a shower before you find a drink of water.

I just want to buy this damn toy helicopter that my girlfriend's kid who keeps asking for it over and over and over. So, inside, am I near the department store? Hell if I know.

It seemed to be a typical upscale store, similar to myriad others in the world, with many boutique shops and most prices on the high end. I noted many Korean-made items available. All floors looked well maintained and had nicely displayed merchandise. It was early November and the whole place was already beautifully decorated for the upcoming holiday season. I didn't interact with any employees so cannot comment on the staff and service.  The food court in the basement, however, brought me back to Lotte twice. I ate two very good dinners (Chinese and Korean) there and found the staff upbeat and pleasant. The cashier for the food court and at least one person at each order counter spoke good English. The area became crowded in the early evening, and I shared my table with a local resident on each visit. Both became lovely dinner companions as we discussed many topics, including what not to miss during my exploration of Seoul.  For those looking for good buys, I cannot recommend Lotte, based on what I saw. But there are plenty of other places nearby, such as Namdaemun Market with its estimated 10,172 stores.

That's where the ""madhouse"" begins :) - in a good way! You will be able to find any kind of cosmetics there, and the prices are good. Don't forget to bargain and ask for freebies!!! I know, it is a large department store, but you still allowed to ask for discount, gifts, and freebies - and get them! All assistants are helpful and speak ok-ish English. Have your passport (or the photo of it) and your return flight details, and have your VAT removed from your total.  If you pay by Visa you can get 5-15% of the total bill. Negotiate it - with gold visa you can get 10%, with platinum -15%.  In the main store you could find great fashion - local and international.

47,21,188,"Make no mistake, the Lotte Dept. Store in Central Seoul near Euljiro 1-ga offers world-class merchandise. You will be completely overwhelmed by the breadth and quality of what you can buy at Lotte, whether it may be high fashion, food, or practically anything else.  That said, the shopping experience leaves a lot to be desired. For example, half of the B1 level is an amazing food store, with Korean groceries, international delicacies, prepared food to take home or to eat on premise. But the floor itself is not optimally laid out, there are too many people and the ceilings are extremely low. I am also not a fan of the faux Baroque architecture typically found in Lotte stores.  Once you experience B1, try to get to the Duty Free floors (9th-11th), which is likely the main reason to visit Lotte. First of all, I challenge you to find an elevator, let alone one you will be able to fit into. Once you get to the floors you will be completely overwhelmed by tourists! Times Square at Christmas is a cakewalk compared to this. My wife, who loves to shop and grew up in Seoul, swears she will never visit the Lotte Duty Free area again.  The other issue with Lotte is the relative lack of subway access. You can directly access the subway #2 line at Euljiro 1-ga but this is the loop line. You will likely need to transfer or walk to a better Metro station. Even if you are staying north of the Han River (Kang-buk) you are better off visiting the Shinsegae branch at the Express Bus Terminal south of the river in Kangnam.
