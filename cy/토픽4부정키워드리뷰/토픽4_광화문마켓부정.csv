I was not even brave enough to sit at the same table with them. I did try their famous pancakes from one of their vegetarian stalls and was mildly impressed. The best find for me in this market was their donuts. The line was long but moved fast. They could not make them fast enough. My family went back for seconds. If you are ever in this market go for the freshly made donuts (its soaped long instead of round), the taste is worth every calorie. You can watch it being made as well. Priced moderately.",4,long

9,6,77,"We came here for lunch and entered on the textile entrance of the market. About halfway into the building is when we finally started to see the food stalls. The first stop was a fish cake stall where we ordered two, each W1000. Both came impaled on a stick along with a cup of broth. Both types of fish cakes were decent and the soup was flavorful.  We were still on the hunt for a good lunch spot when we came across a stand with a large photo of Netflix on it. It turned out to be one of the vendors, Yoonsun Cho, showcased on an episode of Street Food. It was food stall #70 and had one of the largest seating areas which was a stand-alone stall surrounding the cooking and prep areas compared to all the others we walked by. We had to wait about ten minutes before a bench opened to accommodate the whole family. During the interim we watched her make some of her hand cut noodles and prep a number of bowls. Everything we tried was very good from the kimchi mandu to the hand cut noodle and the cold buckwheat noodles (we ordered spicy but it didn‚Äôt pack much heat). Overall they ran a very efficient operation for the lines of people wanting to eat here and the food was reasonably priced at W5000 each for majority of the menu items.  There also was a mung bean fried cake vendor featured on Netflix but we were too full to give hers a try.  The market was crowded and together with all the frying the temperature got a little warm inside.",9,long

We had the handmade noodles (5000Won) and the mixed dumplings (5000Won) Both simple but for some reason we ended up going back the next day to have it again. Simplicity at it's best  Note the stall is near the south gate (stall # 70). If there's something worthy to add, try to find the place along the middle of the walk way as everyone practically sells the same thing but it is only this stall who the overflowing customer (the magic of media). this means the other stalls are not so keen in helping out find her.  before you leave, don't forget to buy some of the local KR crackers (Yummy) and kimchi - ALL TYPES!

11,8,124,"My partner and I had an afternoon free while in Seoul, and after checking some possibilities decided that Gwangjang Market appeared to be within a decent walking distance from our hotel on the western edge of Myeongdong.  Using our trusty Google maps we set off... and what a journey that turned out to be. For some reason we found Google maps (normally very reliable wherever we travel...) tended to get a bit confused at times around Seoul...) to take us on a somewhat weird path to Gwangjang Market... down a variety of minor streets and laneways... on and on we walked, and walked, and walked... until FINALLY we located Gwangjang Market, and what we THOUGHT was a main entrance, off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street, so we entered.  It is an indoor market, BUT... all we could see were aisles and aisle of what seemed to be mainly fabric, bedding, manchester, linen etc. shops and stalls, AND... they were almost all closed! What a disappointment, after having followed Google for maybe 25 minutes around strange streets. This certainly is a large market, somewhat along the lines of Chatuchuk Market in Bangkok. We checked down various aisle/passageways/arcades, but just more of the same, and virtually nothing open. But they weren't the types of stalls/shops we thought we would find here anyway.  After several minutes of checking out various arcades, we were about to give up, when we decided to checkout way down the other end of a very long aisle of shops where there appeared to be some kind of a food shop open. And Hey Presto...!! Here was what we were looking for.  It turns out the Gwangjang Market is more huge than we thought, and that there are apparently two main areas. The first being the more commercial area that we had encountered (off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street), and then at the other end of this huge complex, AND... with its own main entrance off Dongho-ro Street, was the market we thought we were to be visiting. Lots of unique food stalls and street food, bric-a-brac, fruit and vegetables, a huge variety of drink and ice-cream shops and stalls etc. etc. This part of the market is a huge market in its own right. And this part of the market was VERY busy when we visited. It appears to be more popular with the locals, with families buying treats, food, ice-creams etc. for their children, tourists sampling the street foods etc.  From what we could gather, the more commercial part that we initially entered into is apparently only open certain hours or days of the week, whereas the part we now found ourselves in is apparently open every day. Eureka...! It wasn't a wasted day after all.  I love to sample street food items in whatever country I am visiting, so this section of Gwangjang Market certainly provided a wide variety of options.  Gwangjang Market is definitely worth a visit if you have a couple of hours to spare, excluding your travel time to get there. You could probably get away with an hour there, or you could easily stretch it out to at least two hours.  Oh... and regarding travel time... We departed Gwangjang Market via the Dongho-ro Street entrance, and THIS TIME Google maps presented us with a much more direct, and more obvious route back to our hotel, which we could have done in almost half the time on the outward journey... except that we dropped off in the Myeongdong shopping streets for another look around, and to get dinner.",11,long
12,9,134,"If you are looking for local food, this is a must visit place. There are plenty of food stalls in the market and you will be spoilt for choices here. The Korean pancake is one of the more popular choices of food here.  The other point for this market is definitely its fabric shops. This is literally the place to shops Fabric especially the famous Korean Silk. You have to walk through the market to find the best bargain and I can tell you its gonna be a long walk coz the market is so huge.  Its open in the morning and to go here, you can take subway Line 1 and alight at Jongno 5-ga Station and use exit 7 or 8.",12,long

It used to be a place to get some mouthwatering street food, but after it got popular, they no longer accept credit card and became super expensive. Not to mention unhygienic and rude atmosphere. You might want to try out just a little food there, but do not plan to have a whole meal because that will cost more than fine restaurants in the city. The quality has been falling for the past few years. Even for Koreans, this place is tough not to get ripped-off.

We ate with the locals, we ordered Bibimbap rice , korean ramen and mandu and ate it in a crowded food stall where you sit side by side on a long bench. It was fun. We bought from every vendor we saw like the jap chae, mung bean cakes, gimbap, strawberries and rice juice. My daughter fancied the Korean made comforter and we ended up buying one. The korean ginseng is cheaper here so I bought some as well. If you are determined to buy yourself a hanbok better buy it here. They have different designs and sizes.

It wasn't very busy, as I think the shops and stuff are mostly only open during the day, but the majority of the food stalls were still going pretty strong. We walked around the whole thing (didn't take too long) before we decided on a place. Keep in mind this isn't exactly the ""grab and go"" kind of street food. You can move around and try different things if you want, but in these types of markets I prefer to just find a place to sit down and enjoy myself for a bit. The stalls are generally more like little stationary outdoor kitchens (kinda all adjacent to each other) with benches in front for seating. Unfortunately my Korean is horrible so I don't remember the names of what we had, but we sat down at a stall and had some dumpling soup and a spicy cold noodle salad which we'd had at a couple different spots around Korea. The stall owner seemed super concerned about our ability to handle the spice level of the salad, but it was similar in spice level to to a pretty spicy kimchi, so it wasn't too bad for us. If you like to eat a lot of Thai or Indian food (and therefore probably have a tolerance for a bit of spice), you should look for it and try it because it's delicious. It basically is cold rice noodles served with a spicy sauce and a bunch of veggies. The dumplings were good too, it was a nice soup to have on a chilly night when you're sitting outside eating.

As soon as we got in the food section. people were luring us very loudly and kept forcing us to order. That was also quite annoying for us to decide the shop. My friend asked me a name of the food, so I just was watching without asking. Then the owner, understood English, said chicken and started to prepare the dish even we did not order nor seating, whatso ever. My friend didn't want to. So we walked. All of sudden, behind us , the lady started insulting, shouting us swering words in Korean! I was very very startled and offended. When we chose a shop nearby for a glass noodle, the owners were not nice either even if we ordered the dish. And kept us pushing order more dishes. It was around 10 pm after dinner, we went just for snacks, but most of ladies(owners) were rude, and very harsh! As far as I know, this spot has been quite famous and popular but with this kind of rudeness and ill-mannered ways, I have doubt about their longevity. When I tasted the food, it is below average taste. Of Course it is cheap food. I could also see some flies on the unwrapped food in the air. I wondered how these food will survive during the hot summer! They do not have any hygienic concept, I guess. I could see they do not clean their hands properly to serve after eating something.

I find it reasonably priced, a magic universe of food, ingredients, sewing notions (amazing, it is the sewer paradise), electronics, people offering any kind of services, even the ones that are not longer offered in the west. We have seen a guy squatting on the floor repairing an old iron, for example. It is also Fabric Wonderland, every type of fabric is offered there, plus very good clothing, very well priced.

We did not have much time therefore we scout around for those stalls that we are comfortable. The pancake and gimbak was ok and reasonable priced.

Ate fresh dates and explored the many stalls selling everything from traditionally embroidered clothing to sundries and souvenirs. This is clearly a place the locals use.  We were super impressed by how friendly and open people were. They were very happy to share their country (and their table) with foreigners and seemed amused by our photo taking and deer in the headlights look!",67,long
68,65,850,"For some reason, the name of this market (along with a couple of other sights) is alternately spelled with a G or a K. On my map it was spelled with a K and the sign over the market itself was spelled ‚ÄúKwang Jang Market‚Äù. It caused me a little confusion, so I thought I‚Äôd just pass that info on.  The market itself is magical. I‚Äôve been to a lot of food markets over the years and this one is definitely up there in terms of intensity as far as your senses are concerned.  Assuming you‚Äôre traveling during the shoulder seasons (Spring, Fall), the time to catch this market at its peak is just after the sun sets and the store/street lights begin to come on. Just walk right in and get sucked into the swarm of humanity. It‚Äôs a complete sensory overload and as you approach the nexus of the rows of food stalls, you‚Äôll find it difficult to remain stationary. The human tides pulsing all around you will push you in one direction after another. No photograph could possibly do it justice; I ended up having to video-tape it in order to best capture it.  This is one of a few instances where you will genuinely lament that you don‚Äôt have a Korean friend or travel mate who knows how to grab a seat, knows what the food is and how to order it (unless you know Korean, you‚Äôll be reduced to pointing and praying for the most part), what sauce you should dip what food into, figuring out the cost, etc.  I‚Äôve rated it excellent because not only will you get a good, genuine Korean meal sitting alongside them, you‚Äôll also get a sensory rush that will stay with you long after you‚Äôve come home, but most importantly, you‚Äôll get a glimpse into the very essence of Koreans and their relationship with food. Outside of being invited into the home of someone hosting a family get together, this is the closest you‚Äôll ever get to a candid portrait of Koreans as their omnivorous selves.  There are assorted shops selling various items along the periphery, but they‚Äôll be little more than background scenery if you come at the right time.",68,long

We had the famous pancake, the stir fried glass noodle (japchae) & the braised pork knuckle. The pancake was really delicious while the japchae was a bit over seasoned with pepper. The pork knuckle should be tasty if it's not served cold but I guess it's the way they eat it here. Total costs 15k krw. Be careful when you are not speaking Korean, they might mistaken that you wanna order although you only wanna ask wat the dish they are selling. After dinner we walked the other aisle only to find out that there are many other variety of food there.  Tips: check out all the stalls to decide what you wanna eat.

Using our trusty Google maps we set off... and what a journey that turned out to be. For some reason we found Google maps (normally very reliable wherever we travel...) tended to get a bit confused at times around Seoul...) to take us on a somewhat weird path to Gwangjang Market... down a variety of minor streets and laneways... on and on we walked, and walked, and walked... until FINALLY we located Gwangjang Market, and what we THOUGHT was a main entrance, off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street, so we entered.  It is an indoor market, BUT... all we could see were aisles and aisle of what seemed to be mainly fabric, bedding, manchester, linen etc. shops and stalls, AND... they were almost all closed! What a disappointment, after having followed Google for maybe 25 minutes around strange streets. This certainly is a large market, somewhat along the lines of Chatuchuk Market in Bangkok. We checked down various aisle/passageways/arcades, but just more of the same, and virtually nothing open. But they weren't the types of stalls/shops we thought we would find here anyway.  After several minutes of checking out various arcades, we were about to give up, when we decided to checkout way down the other end of a very long aisle of shops where there appeared to be some kind of a food shop open. And Hey Presto...!! Here was what we were looking for.  It turns out the Gwangjang Market is more huge than we thought, and that there are apparently two main areas. The first being the more commercial area that we had encountered (off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street), and then at the other end of this huge complex, AND... with its own main entrance off Dongho-ro Street, was the market we thought we were to be visiting. Lots of unique food stalls and street food, bric-a-brac, fruit and vegetables, a huge variety of drink and ice-cream shops and stalls etc. etc. This part of the market is a huge market in its own right. And this part of the market was VERY busy when we visited. It appears to be more popular with the locals, with families buying treats, food, ice-creams etc. for their children, tourists sampling the street foods etc.  From what we could gather, the more commercial part that we initially entered into is apparently only open certain hours or days of the week, whereas the part we now found ourselves in is apparently open every day. Eureka...! It wasn't a wasted day after all.  I love to sample street food items in whatever country I am visiting, so this section of Gwangjang Market certainly provided a wide variety of options.  Gwangjang Market is definitely worth a visit if you have a couple of hours to spare, excluding your travel time to get there. You could probably get away with an hour there, or you could easily stretch it out to at least two hours.  Oh... and regarding travel time... We departed Gwangjang Market via the Dongho-ro Street entrance, and THIS TIME Google maps presented us with a much more direct, and more obvious route back to our hotel, which we could have done in almost half the time on the outward journey... except that we dropped off in the Myeongdong shopping streets for another look around, and to get dinner.",80,nothing

We were still on the hunt for a good lunch spot when we came across a stand with a large photo of Netflix on it. It turned out to be one of the vendors, Yoonsun Cho, showcased on an episode of Street Food. It was food stall #70 and had one of the largest seating areas which was a stand-alone stall surrounding the cooking and prep areas compared to all the others we walked by. We had to wait about ten minutes before a bench opened to accommodate the whole family. During the interim we watched her make some of her hand cut noodles and prep a number of bowls. Everything we tried was very good from the kimchi mandu to the hand cut noodle and the cold buckwheat noodles (we ordered spicy but it didn‚Äôt pack much heat). Overall they ran a very efficient operation for the lines of people wanting to eat here and the food was reasonably priced at W5000 each for majority of the menu items.  There also was a mung bean fried cake vendor featured on Netflix but we were too full to give hers a try.

Only come here to experience the market feel, and try some food if you want. But bear in mind it's a tourist rate :(",169,crowded
170,71,808,"We arrived at Gwangjang Market late evening; our main purpose is to try some of the popular local food (bibimbap, pancake, gimbak, etc). The place was crowded with diners sitting in front of the many stalls. Some of the popular stalls had long queues, probably the food taste better. We did not have much time therefore we scout around for those stalls that we are comfortable. The pancake and gimbak was ok and reasonable priced.  I would recommend this place only to food lovers who like to explore the locals way of life and try the varieties of local food. You will also need to close an eye on the hygiene here, which is not of the highest standard.",170,crowded

It was recommended by my Korean teacher because I said I want to eat traditional Korean food. No pasta, no bread, no pizza please. So she recommended this Gwangjang Sijang.  Easy to access by public transport. I took a subway from Gwanghwamun. I think it was about a few stops away.  I was going to eat sundaegukbap but I just remember that it's pork and my friends were Muslim. So we settled for some jeons (pancake). Most food are pork-based, or soups, very very traditional and a few look homemade to me. Love them to death. Bring a Korean friend! I spoke functional Korean languange for the purpose of the trip. But ahjumma and ahjussi (aunties and uncles) there can be hard to understand and they do not speak English, and you might want to know what's in what food.",171,crowded

But the real reason any tourist or foreigner would want to go there is for the food experience. The market is famous for their mung bean pancakes, but the various food vendors there sell all the different savory and sweet pancakes famous in Korean street food, as well as bibimbap and various fish and pork stews and sausages and things like that.  It's basically a foodie paradise if you're looking for the traditional korean experience of eating street food and common Korean food in public with real Korean people. There aren't as many tourists at this market as some of the more famous ones like Dongdaemun or Namdaemun, and if you go early in the day, like around noon or before, it's not crowded and you can take the time to enjoy a relaxing meal sitting on a bench at one of the many little food places that are crammed into this place. They also have clearly marked street signs throughout the place directing you to the various exits and subway stations and local landmarks and the food court area, as well as conveniently located bathrooms, although I can't vouch for cleanliness exactly. All I can say is they weren't the worst I've seen and they seemed to be easier to find and use than some of the other markets.  I went there with a friend and we stopped at the first place we found that had mung bean pancakes and ended up talking with an older Korean gentleman that was so friendly and liked us so much that he bought our meal after feeding us some of his soju and offering us his cigarettes.

184,5,124,"My partner and I had an afternoon free while in Seoul, and after checking some possibilities decided that Gwangjang Market appeared to be within a decent walking distance from our hotel on the western edge of Myeongdong.  Using our trusty Google maps we set off... and what a journey that turned out to be. For some reason we found Google maps (normally very reliable wherever we travel...) tended to get a bit confused at times around Seoul...) to take us on a somewhat weird path to Gwangjang Market... down a variety of minor streets and laneways... on and on we walked, and walked, and walked... until FINALLY we located Gwangjang Market, and what we THOUGHT was a main entrance, off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street, so we entered.  It is an indoor market, BUT... all we could see were aisles and aisle of what seemed to be mainly fabric, bedding, manchester, linen etc. shops and stalls, AND... they were almost all closed! What a disappointment, after having followed Google for maybe 25 minutes around strange streets. This certainly is a large market, somewhat along the lines of Chatuchuk Market in Bangkok. We checked down various aisle/passageways/arcades, but just more of the same, and virtually nothing open. But they weren't the types of stalls/shops we thought we would find here anyway.  After several minutes of checking out various arcades, we were about to give up, when we decided to checkout way down the other end of a very long aisle of shops where there appeared to be some kind of a food shop open. And Hey Presto...!! Here was what we were looking for.  It turns out the Gwangjang Market is more huge than we thought, and that there are apparently two main areas. The first being the more commercial area that we had encountered (off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street), and then at the other end of this huge complex, AND... with its own main entrance off Dongho-ro Street, was the market we thought we were to be visiting. Lots of unique food stalls and street food, bric-a-brac, fruit and vegetables, a huge variety of drink and ice-cream shops and stalls etc. etc. This part of the market is a huge market in its own right. And this part of the market was VERY busy when we visited. It appears to be more popular with the locals, with families buying treats, food, ice-creams etc. for their children, tourists sampling the street foods etc.  From what we could gather, the more commercial part that we initially entered into is apparently only open certain hours or days of the week, whereas the part we now found ourselves in is apparently open every day. Eureka...! It wasn't a wasted day after all.  I love to sample street food items in whatever country I am visiting, so this section of Gwangjang Market certainly provided a wide variety of options.  Gwangjang Market is definitely worth a visit if you have a couple of hours to spare, excluding your travel time to get there. You could probably get away with an hour there, or you could easily stretch it out to at least two hours.  Oh... and regarding travel time... We departed Gwangjang Market via the Dongho-ro Street entrance, and THIS TIME Google maps presented us with a much more direct, and more obvious route back to our hotel, which we could have done in almost half the time on the outward journey... except that we dropped off in the Myeongdong shopping streets for another look around, and to get dinner.",184,visited

Right after one take Exit 8 of Jongno 5(o)-ga station, beside is the Gwangjang Market. There is a main local food street alley that cut across this large Gwangjang marke, selling lots of interesting local food/snacks, ranging from inexpensive & popular Mung bean pancakes, Korean Kimbap (similar to Japanese Maki roll) to mid range traditional Jokbal (braised pig trotters) and to more expensive fresh seafoods like live Octopus & Abalone to go with the Korean Shoju. But what amazes me the most is the ""Ganjang Gejang"", a Korean traditional disk that uses raw... (you read me correctly...) 'raw' crabs/prawns/fish roes lightly marinated with either soyu-based sauce, or more spicy bean paste sauce. As for rest of Gangjang market, we saw lots of shops selling mainly traditional Hanbok, beddings materials and some ladies fashions.

As soon as we got in the food section. people were luring us very loudly and kept forcing us to order. That was also quite annoying for us to decide the shop. My friend asked me a name of the food, so I just was watching without asking. Then the owner, understood English, said chicken and started to prepare the dish even we did not order nor seating, whatso ever. My friend didn't want to. So we walked. All of sudden, behind us , the lady started insulting, shouting us swering words in Korean! I was very very startled and offended. When we chose a shop nearby for a glass noodle, the owners were not nice either even if we ordered the dish. And kept us pushing order more dishes. It was around 10 pm after dinner, we went just for snacks, but most of ladies(owners) were rude, and very harsh! As far as I know, this spot has been quite famous and popular but with this kind of rudeness and ill-mannered ways, I have doubt about their longevity. When I tasted the food, it is below average taste. Of Course it is cheap food. I could also see some flies on the unwrapped food in the air. I wondered how these food will survive during the hot summer! They do not have any hygienic concept, I guess. I could see they do not clean their hands properly to serve after eating something. There are a few seating restaurants which are kind and nice with better food in this place, but I should have searched in advance and should come during the daytime.

224,6,63,"Went with my brother to have a good experience as seen online. One of the food stall owners was very pushy and persuaded us to sit down after saying she'd give us ""service"" (free food). We ate some and asked if we could take the rest of the food away as we wanted to leave quickly, still thinking it was ""service"". Also important to note I spoke Korean though I'm not 100% fluent. I was quite naive, and at this point she added more food that we didn't ask for. I then asked how much this would all be(as it was a lot for free food) and she told me it was 16,000won. I then felt pressured into paying because she purposefully gave us a lot of food without asking. The stall owner was very old and our Korean wasn't good enough to argue with her. My brother was also feeling sick. At the time, there were a lot of people as well as the weather being very rainy and humid, so we just wanted to get away as soon as possible. Make sure to be very firm with what exactly you want to eat and always ask straightaway as to how much the food will be or make sure that the food is still ""service"" if offered.",224,much

Love the dumplings from one stall right at the end of the food alley. Many aunties are selling similar food but depending solely on each skill to attract patrons. The other alley are stalls selling korean costumes and modern clothings. You should bargain, but not too much. Another alley has stalls selling daily necessities, like towels, scrub towels, etc. And another alley has stalls selling the different types of titbits like seaweed cracker, seaweed, almonds. There is also another alley like wet market, selling seafood and dried fishes.",225,much
226,8,77,"We came here for lunch and entered on the textile entrance of the market. About halfway into the building is when we finally started to see the food stalls. The first stop was a fish cake stall where we ordered two, each W1000. Both came impaled on a stick along with a cup of broth. Both types of fish cakes were decent and the soup was flavorful.  We were still on the hunt for a good lunch spot when we came across a stand with a large photo of Netflix on it. It turned out to be one of the vendors, Yoonsun Cho, showcased on an episode of Street Food. It was food stall #70 and had one of the largest seating areas which was a stand-alone stall surrounding the cooking and prep areas compared to all the others we walked by. We had to wait about ten minutes before a bench opened to accommodate the whole family. During the interim we watched her make some of her hand cut noodles and prep a number of bowls. Everything we tried was very good from the kimchi mandu to the hand cut noodle and the cold buckwheat noodles (we ordered spicy but it didn‚Äôt pack much heat). Overall they ran a very efficient operation for the lines of people wanting to eat here and the food was reasonably priced at W5000 each for majority of the menu items.  There also was a mung bean fried cake vendor featured on Netflix but we were too full to give hers a try.  The market was crowded and together with all the frying the temperature got a little warm inside.",226,much

The fried pancake filled with pork, sold right in the crux of the market was delicious.

The street food style eating is much better than Namdaemun. There is everything you could want. We ate bimbap and tteokbokki while seated on a heated bench; 3000 won each and generous. At another stall, we ate a honey pancake. Delicious! Walked around for a couple of hours, including across the street where there are many climbing gear shops. Expensive, but fun to browse. One even serves beer and coffee. Look for the one called ‚Äúmygear‚Äù. Vas‚Äôs beer in a 16 oz glass is 3000 won. Coffee made to order. Very nice host.

232,14,124,"My partner and I had an afternoon free while in Seoul, and after checking some possibilities decided that Gwangjang Market appeared to be within a decent walking distance from our hotel on the western edge of Myeongdong.  Using our trusty Google maps we set off... and what a journey that turned out to be. For some reason we found Google maps (normally very reliable wherever we travel...) tended to get a bit confused at times around Seoul...) to take us on a somewhat weird path to Gwangjang Market... down a variety of minor streets and laneways... on and on we walked, and walked, and walked... until FINALLY we located Gwangjang Market, and what we THOUGHT was a main entrance, off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street, so we entered.  It is an indoor market, BUT... all we could see were aisles and aisle of what seemed to be mainly fabric, bedding, manchester, linen etc. shops and stalls, AND... they were almost all closed! What a disappointment, after having followed Google for maybe 25 minutes around strange streets. This certainly is a large market, somewhat along the lines of Chatuchuk Market in Bangkok. We checked down various aisle/passageways/arcades, but just more of the same, and virtually nothing open. But they weren't the types of stalls/shops we thought we would find here anyway.  After several minutes of checking out various arcades, we were about to give up, when we decided to checkout way down the other end of a very long aisle of shops where there appeared to be some kind of a food shop open. And Hey Presto...!! Here was what we were looking for.  It turns out the Gwangjang Market is more huge than we thought, and that there are apparently two main areas. The first being the more commercial area that we had encountered (off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street), and then at the other end of this huge complex, AND... with its own main entrance off Dongho-ro Street, was the market we thought we were to be visiting. Lots of unique food stalls and street food, bric-a-brac, fruit and vegetables, a huge variety of drink and ice-cream shops and stalls etc. etc. This part of the market is a huge market in its own right. And this part of the market was VERY busy when we visited. It appears to be more popular with the locals, with families buying treats, food, ice-creams etc. for their children, tourists sampling the street foods etc.  From what we could gather, the more commercial part that we initially entered into is apparently only open certain hours or days of the week, whereas the part we now found ourselves in is apparently open every day. Eureka...! It wasn't a wasted day after all.  I love to sample street food items in whatever country I am visiting, so this section of Gwangjang Market certainly provided a wide variety of options.  Gwangjang Market is definitely worth a visit if you have a couple of hours to spare, excluding your travel time to get there. You could probably get away with an hour there, or you could easily stretch it out to at least two hours.  Oh... and regarding travel time... We departed Gwangjang Market via the Dongho-ro Street entrance, and THIS TIME Google maps presented us with a much more direct, and more obvious route back to our hotel, which we could have done in almost half the time on the outward journey... except that we dropped off in the Myeongdong shopping streets for another look around, and to get dinner.",232,much

First, it would be impossible to do this market justice by any single review. One could spend a month here and still not discover all that it offers. I was interested in trying Korean beef tatare. I found my way to ‚Äúraw beef alley‚Äù and picked a place. The beef here is delivered each morning and is of the highest quality and freshness. I tried my dish with a chopped live baby octopus on top. Most westerners may balk at the dish when they see the chopped tentacles moving about on top of a mound of bright red raw beef. Break the egg yolk on top and dig in! I guarantee it will be one of the most delicious dishes you have ever tasted. If you eat sushi and like your steak rare, then it‚Äôs not much of a step to eat Korean beef tartare and live baby octopus.",233,much

Once we decided to stop at one of the stalls and try out the pancakes, they brought out 2 when we only wanted one so we ended up having to pay for both. Felt a little tricked because we‚Äôre foreigners. Wanted to look at fabrics, but every time we would stop to check them out, we would get harassed by the sellers and when we‚Äôd decide not to buy, they‚Äôd get upset and start becoming unfriendly.

Make time however, to take in the fish, spice, kimchi and textile stores on route. There is a massive choice of places to eat, with each type of speciallity seeming to have the same location with different stall traders servicing the same option in each area. Prices are clearly shown and standard across the piece. Not as cheap as I expected but still much better than western prices. We chose to have just one type of dish (portion ) at each stall so we could try as many things as we could before getting full. Mung bean pancakes were our fav!4000 a portion. Bibimbap 5000 was really good. Fish cakes in a soup were nice at 3000. Sundae a blood sausage filled with spiced sweet rice were fantastic, they are served with cooked liver which reminded me of my child hood 6000. Bottled water is provided free - one central bottle from which you fill your own cup. Alternatively look for stores on the side selling Cass beer in small cans for 2000.

Common format was to have a cooking stall at the front onto the street with some tables in a room behind. Sitting at the tables was a bit less frenetic. Not much english spoken, but got by fine with 'point and smile' as menus have pictures and an english title for each dish. A meal (a sort of half pancake, half omelette with green beans and seafood) and a beer was 16,000 Won.

Yes they were heated, how good was that for winter and an open space! But the food ... pretty average, nothing special. I was actually quite disappointed after my trip to Korea overall. I tried all the famous food I saw on the Korean drama, none of them were good. I was very keen on Korean food before, loved everything from the Korean restaurants here in Australia, but since I been there and tried it? I would say the Korean food which‚Äôs not from actual Korea is lot better. Korea is quite expensive compare to other Asian countries.

Gwangjang was among the most frenetic, crowded and dirty of them. We were not inspired to eat there. Instead, we were more comfortable with the street food in Myeongdong.

The korean ginseng is cheaper here so I bought some as well. If you are determined to buy yourself a hanbok better buy it here. They have different designs and sizes.

255,37,328,"I came to Gwangjang with a couple of friends in the height of summer (early July), and the atmosphere was everything you would expect from an Asian food market. It was sweltering with only the occasional fan; it was dense with people bustling by to get their fill of kimbap; and it was very local. The general sentiment was that you were one of only a handful of foreigners wandering the place, and the local ajummas (Korean old ladies) were constantly trying to herd you to sit down and partake in their delicious, sesame-infused offerings so that they could prove to other onlookers that they were tourist friendly.  Many of the workers and food purveyors spoke enough broken English for you to get your food and get it paid for without any problems, but it was kind of a moot point, because each little stall only had a handful of options, and they usually had their dishes set out so you could just point and ask for an order. There were little stalls that specialized in kimbap (some offer a tuna version, so just ask for ""cheum chi"" kimbap if you are tired of the garden variety), others ""japchae"" (Korean cold glass noodles with veggies), and others Korean potato pancakes with leeks (and a scrumptious onion sauce that you should ask for double portions of).  Overall, the food was good and some of the food purveyors were really friendly, but others weren't. I made the idiotic mistake of forgetting to ask a stall owner how much a handful of mandu (Korean dumplings) was before the lady plopped them into the steamer. She told me afterwards that they were $5 (the standard street price is between $1-2). Luckily, she was sulking about something and forgot to get the mandu back out of the boiling water while I was eating the rest of my meal, so I left just after I finished my other entree. She could overcharge another customer for those later.  Ladies like that are usually the exception. But, it's Seoul. It's fast paced, and people are churning out thousands of customers every Saturday night. It's not a perfect experience, it's just an experience. Sure, there are flies buzzing over some of the dishes, but this is what you're paying for. You could easily buy kimbap in a convenience store, or you could get the local atmosphere and eat your Korean pancake awkwardly while sitting over a plastic stool made for a toddler, surrounded by heaps of trash and excitable scads of locals. Just head over to Gwangjang.",255,much

I didn't fancy the chicken feet but my friends sang praises of it. In fact, we went to the same stall several days later and we ordered pretty much the same thing. Each dish was 5k Korean won.  After tucking into the food, we went around hunting for local souvenirs. This can be found scattered all around the markets. In fact, many shops carry similar goods and all one would need to do is to find the best prices for the goods.  Later on, we stopped to have one of the pancakes but it was huge and we could only finish half of it amongst the 5 of us ladies.

Soondae steaming hot vermicelli ""blood pudding"", sliced and dipped in the special shrimp-salt mix  4. Hobakjuk: steaming hot bowl of sweet pumpkin porridge thickened with glutinous rice flour. Heaven. 4= Patjuk: same as above but with red bean  Hint: If you're there in winter, pick up a bag of freshly roasted chestnuts outside (one of the street vendors on the kerb) and try eating a few with the above porridges. It is a marriage made in heaven, and a quite traditional combination. Also, make sure to ask if they will do a ""refill"" if you're dining in (Koreans also use the word ""refill"")  5. Twiggim: Korean version on tempura - battered, crispy shrimp and vegetables  The place is also great if you want fabric or hanbok made. It's not that friendly towards people who don't speak English, but not rude either. They will try to understand you. There's not much point looking at every stall as everything's practically just a repeat. If you see some seats become vacant in a busy looking stall, just pull up and point at what you want, and you'll do just great.  Not a great place to take strollers / not particularly wheelchair friendly unfortunately. Take breath mints if you're companion is sensitive to garlic and blood-pudding-breath like mine is!",270,much
271,53,472,"Don't think you'll find much to buy unless you're in the market for traditional fabrics and clothing.  Lots of street food, might not appeal to everyone. You'll find more 'traditional' street foods like Kimbap, spicy rice cakes, odeng, bibimbap (vegetarian), lots of grannies and ahjummas gathered round for their meal time-gossip session (store holders involved).  The mung bean pancakes are yummy though! Crispy on the outside, and pure deliciousness inside! Doesn't taste anything like I would have imagined (I have a slight aversion towards anything with beans except beansprouts), in fact more like a thick rosti with extra ingredients inside. I'll skip the tempting-looking bowl of hand cut noodles next time though.",271,much
272,54,483,One thing about this place is it's your typical market. People selling food and stuff for a cheap price. The cleanliness of the place can be a bit doubtful but one can never be to careful.

The taste was really good though and i wasn't able to find other places selling it. Tried their mung bean pancake and it was good. We went here a little early so there wasn't much people and not everything was open yet. I think the best time to go here would be afternoon to night time.,272,much

If you don't know Korean it's fine, pointing at the food to order would work as well, some of the stall owners can speak a little English/Chinese.

Make time however, to take in the fish, spice, kimchi and textile stores on route. There is a massive choice of places to eat, with each type of speciallity seeming to have the same location with different stall traders servicing the same option in each area. Prices are clearly shown and standard across the piece. Not as cheap as I expected but still much better than western prices. We chose to have just one type of dish (portion ) at each stall so we could try as many things as we could before getting full. Mung bean pancakes were our fav!4000 a portion. Bibimbap 5000 was really good. Fish cakes in a soup were nice at 3000. Sundae a blood sausage filled with spiced sweet rice were fantastic, they are served with cooked liver which reminded me of my child hood 6000. Bottled water is provided free - one central bottle from which you fill your own cup. Alternatively look for stores on the side selling Cass beer in small cans for 2000. Kimchi as usual was served complmentary. Didnt try any fish stuff as off to Busan later. Deffo a great place to try most of Koreas fantastic food in a great atmosphere.",275,much
276,58,506,"Big food market, crowded with a confusion of sights, sounds and smells. I was wandering from my hotel looking for somewhere to eat on a sunday evening when many surrounding restaurants were closed and suddenly came across this market with an over-abundance of choice of street food. Common format was to have a cooking stall at the front onto the street with some tables in a room behind. Sitting at the tables was a bit less frenetic. Not much english spoken, but got by fine with 'point and smile' as menus have pictures and an english title for each dish. A meal (a sort of half pancake, half omelette with green beans and seafood) and a beer was 16,000 Won. On a sunday evening I seemed to be the only tourist among thousands of people, many buying a take-away in metal foil containers. Going to the market for a desert of deep fried sweet pastry with a dipping cup of sugar also seemed very popular.",276,much

We were very disappointed as it was much more intimidating than expected. We had already been to many places to eat in Seoul and to various markets. Gwangjang was among the most frenetic, crowded and dirty of them. We were not inspired to eat there. Instead, we were more comfortable with the street food in Myeongdong. I'm sure this is an instance of a difference in Western and Asian sensibilities, but I feel that Western tourists should be made aware that Gwangjang is not like anything you would be used to in the West.",277,much

They also have live octopus (Sanakji) at the Market, there is a shop located at the beginning of the street which i will not suggest you to go (sorry i forgotten the name, we went for the Sanakji randomly). Service is bad, there is no table for us and they ask us to sit outside with no proper table to eat, the octopus was stated 6000 won and they say they have, once we sat down they say that they don't have it. We felt cheated.",279,much
280,62,543,"Great place for Korean local foods. Lots of stalls all selling similar food items. Aside from that, not much is worth visiting and I believe most tourists come here just for the food, as we didn't see people checking out the stores that're lined around the whole market.",280,much
281,63,563,"This is another well known traditional market but the goods offered are much the same as any other market. the real draw is the food which will be quite exotic to most - I saw ""drug octopus"" and ""Dog Meat Soup"" amongst the very big emphasis on seafood.",281,much

We took the subway there and it was not difficult locating the market. We were hunting for good local food and found them at the bibimbap stall no. 39 where we ordered the famed dish along with some dumplings, octopus and chicken feet. I didn't fancy the chicken feet but my friends sang praises of it. In fact, we went to the same stall several days later and we ordered pretty much the same thing. Each dish was 5k Korean won.  After tucking into the food, we went around hunting for local souvenirs. This can be found scattered all around the markets. In fact, many shops carry similar goods and all one would need to do is to find the best prices for the goods.  Later on, we stopped to have one of the pancakes but it was huge and we could only finish half of it amongst the 5 of us ladies.  You would need about half a day or slightly over that at least to do justice to this place. The market is only a short distance from the famous Dongdaemun market along with the many fashion malls.",284,much

And also the building itself is not that huge. So that could be an advantage if you don't have that much time. SInce the place is very crowded, eating there (standing and sometimes there is a chair) is not really comfortable.

Too many vendors to be chosen and those ahjumas will keep calling you to eat at their place. This is one of the problem I see in South Korea that they really compete to each other with the same stuffs just to see which stall more popular by the crowd. We eat the traditional Bimbimbap, tteokbokki, hand cut noodles and dumpling and it was pretty good. They rarely speak English but they speak Chinese due to the growing of Chinese tourists to South Korea but most of them have English menu so you can just ask to see the price before you eat at their stall. The price range on every stall pretty much the same and eating at the market doesn't mean cheap price (KRW 5000-10,000) depends on what you eat. Anyway it always a good experience to see a traditional market in every country to feel more about the culture and their food and I feel that Korea has the best street food so far.",298,much

There are many food stalls to sample local food and you can even buy banchan (small side dishes) back to your hotel to slowly savour them.

So, fabrics, dried food produce etc. Fruit here is fresh and pretty affordable and there are also lots of food stalls in the center of the area. We tried Bindaetteok, which is a kind of pancake only found in that area of Seoul (that‚Äôs what I heard).

The kimbap was addictive and tastes different from the ones sold outside. The seaweed that wraps the kimbap was more crispy and tasty. I would go back again.

We did not have much time therefore we scout around for those stalls that we are comfortable. The pancake and gimbak was ok and reasonable priced.

Ate fresh dates and explored the many stalls selling everything from traditionally embroidered clothing to sundries and souvenirs. This is clearly a place the locals use.

We bought some marinated crabs and octopus in Gwangjang market. Those Ajummas who sold the marinated food were so funny and nice. They even gave us a bag of other marinated seafoods for free b/c they knew that we haven't tried those marinated seafoods before. (In Gwangjang, those Ajummas will give you try the food before you buy. They will also give you free hot tea and yogurt drinks while you are picking the food --> awesome customer service)  Besides food, we also found Korean traditional clothing, bedding stuffs and accessories in the market.

The women who worked at the stall were friendly and not too pushy. We ate mixed jeon, sundae, jokbal (pig's feet) and dalkbal (chicken feet). The prices were a lot more than you would normally pay for this type of food- 10,000 each for the jeon and chicken feet, 8,000 for the jokbal and 7,000 for the sundae. Big bottles of Cass were 5,000 each. There were no prices displayed.  I live in Korea so I've tried these dishes before. I was disappointed with the quality of the food, especially for the price. Street food is normally cheap and tasty with prices displayed clearly.

But the real reason any tourist or foreigner would want to go there is for the food experience. The market is famous for their mung bean pancakes, but the various food vendors there sell all the different savory and sweet pancakes famous in Korean street food, as well as bibimbap and various fish and pork stews and sausages and things like that.  It's basically a foodie paradise if you're looking for the traditional korean experience of eating street food and common Korean food in public with real Korean people. There aren't as many tourists at this market as some of the more famous ones like Dongdaemun or Namdaemun, and if you go early in the day, like around noon or before, it's not crowded and you can take the time to enjoy a relaxing meal sitting on a bench at one of the many little food places that are crammed into this place. They also have clearly marked street signs throughout the place directing you to the various exits and subway stations and local landmarks and the food court area, as well as conveniently located bathrooms, although I can't vouch for cleanliness exactly. All I can say is they weren't the worst I've seen and they seemed to be easier to find and use than some of the other markets.  I went there with a friend and we stopped at the first place we found that had mung bean pancakes and ended up talking with an older Korean gentleman that was so friendly and liked us so much that he bought our meal after feeding us some of his soju and offering us his cigarettes.

320,3,124,"My partner and I had an afternoon free while in Seoul, and after checking some possibilities decided that Gwangjang Market appeared to be within a decent walking distance from our hotel on the western edge of Myeongdong.  Using our trusty Google maps we set off... and what a journey that turned out to be. For some reason we found Google maps (normally very reliable wherever we travel...) tended to get a bit confused at times around Seoul...) to take us on a somewhat weird path to Gwangjang Market... down a variety of minor streets and laneways... on and on we walked, and walked, and walked... until FINALLY we located Gwangjang Market, and what we THOUGHT was a main entrance, off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street, so we entered.  It is an indoor market, BUT... all we could see were aisles and aisle of what seemed to be mainly fabric, bedding, manchester, linen etc. shops and stalls, AND... they were almost all closed! What a disappointment, after having followed Google for maybe 25 minutes around strange streets. This certainly is a large market, somewhat along the lines of Chatuchuk Market in Bangkok. We checked down various aisle/passageways/arcades, but just more of the same, and virtually nothing open. But they weren't the types of stalls/shops we thought we would find here anyway.  After several minutes of checking out various arcades, we were about to give up, when we decided to checkout way down the other end of a very long aisle of shops where there appeared to be some kind of a food shop open. And Hey Presto...!! Here was what we were looking for.  It turns out the Gwangjang Market is more huge than we thought, and that there are apparently two main areas. The first being the more commercial area that we had encountered (off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street), and then at the other end of this huge complex, AND... with its own main entrance off Dongho-ro Street, was the market we thought we were to be visiting. Lots of unique food stalls and street food, bric-a-brac, fruit and vegetables, a huge variety of drink and ice-cream shops and stalls etc. etc. This part of the market is a huge market in its own right. And this part of the market was VERY busy when we visited. It appears to be more popular with the locals, with families buying treats, food, ice-creams etc. for their children, tourists sampling the street foods etc.  From what we could gather, the more commercial part that we initially entered into is apparently only open certain hours or days of the week, whereas the part we now found ourselves in is apparently open every day. Eureka...! It wasn't a wasted day after all.  I love to sample street food items in whatever country I am visiting, so this section of Gwangjang Market certainly provided a wide variety of options.  Gwangjang Market is definitely worth a visit if you have a couple of hours to spare, excluding your travel time to get there. You could probably get away with an hour there, or you could easily stretch it out to at least two hours.  Oh... and regarding travel time... We departed Gwangjang Market via the Dongho-ro Street entrance, and THIS TIME Google maps presented us with a much more direct, and more obvious route back to our hotel, which we could have done in almost half the time on the outward journey... except that we dropped off in the Myeongdong shopping streets for another look around, and to get dinner.",320,tourists

The buffet breakfast in our stomachs allowed us to take our time watching what eateries the locals were patronizing. They know what's good, so I'm following them. Obviously, we can't read Korean, so I just took pictures (see attached). The best pancakes seemed to be the one with the orange sign (says since 1994). We sat in front on the benches with tables, enjoyed our 4000 Won pancake while watching customers go in & out of the dine-in restaurant. Plus, many locals were buying takeaway plastic containers of uncooked pancake mix. Amazing, it's that popular! Then 2 different stall owners told us to eat the 2500 Won Japchae (transparent noodles with sesame oil and soy sauce) from this lady at stall #41. We just sat on stools holding our plates and watched this endless line of folks buying the 3 things they sold. We were also impressed how the 2 ladies left their money sitting in 2 bowls for all to see and everyone stayed honest!",321,tourists

It used to be a place to get some mouthwatering street food, but after it got popular, they no longer accept credit card and became super expensive. Not to mention unhygienic and rude atmosphere. You might want to try out just a little food there, but do not plan to have a whole meal because that will cost more than fine restaurants in the city. The quality has been falling for the past few years. Even for Koreans, this place is tough not to get ripped-off.

This is one of the problem I see in South Korea that they really compete to each other with the same stuffs just to see which stall more popular by the crowd. We eat the traditional Bimbimbap, tteokbokki, hand cut noodles and dumpling and it was pretty good. They rarely speak English but they speak Chinese due to the growing of Chinese tourists to South Korea but most of them have English menu so you can just ask to see the price before you eat at their stall. The price range on every stall pretty much the same and eating at the market doesn't mean cheap price (KRW 5000-10,000) depends on what you eat.

Only come here to experience the market feel, and try some food if you want. But bear in mind it's a tourist rate :(",377,tourists

Sadly the price nowadays became rather stiff since there are a lot of tourists nowadays after it got famous, But still they provide us with delicious local foods at reasonable..? price. You must eat alive octopus, raw-beef, drug kimbap and... you will see!",378,tourists
379,62,828,"Variety of food and snacks. Selling ready to eat food, like kimbap, pancake. There is another section whereby they are selling raw marinated seafood. Ginseng can be found here too. Lot of local and tourists",379,tourists
380,63,837,"Yes, this is the market place crowded with locals and tourists. If you're afraid of language bearer, not to worry, most of the stalls do have helpers that speak Mandarin or simple English. You may not want to miss the various hot-pot offering in the tiny restaurants too. I prefer to go there near noon when the shops there are opened and you will get a lot of stuff there at good price. The kimchi stores there also offer air-tight packing for your shipment too.",380,tourists
381,64,857,"This market is so big, it could take a whole day to see everything. There's clothing, beautiful local Korean apparel for children and adults, shoes, fabric,etc. and best of all, FOOD! This is were you can taste everything Korean, from dumplings, seafood, noodles, all kinds of Korean delicacies. There are stalls with stools where you can sit and order whatever food the stall is selling. Lots of locals and tourists come here to shop and eat. This place is a ""must see"".",381,tourists
382,65,886,"It‚Äôs an indoor market. We went on a Sunday and some shops are closed so we headed straight to the food court. The food section were huge and busy with tons of tourists. There were many vendors selling the same food so walk around before you decide to sit down. We had many quick stops - Korean fried chicken, bibibap, fried green beans cake, fried pork cake, grilled red bean cake, bamboo-like juice, fried donut‚Ä¶etc‚Ä¶ If you dare to try, vendors are selling live octopus (not sashimi, they eat them live). We also found a store near the food court selling cheaper ginseng tea and candies (with bargain of course).",382,tourists
383,66,887,"This market is very good for vegetables and other edibles. It is mainly a clothing market and has little to attract tourists from a souvenir perspective, but the cooked food area has a lot of pancakes and fried goodies, along with lots of meat and seafood. Definitely a good choice for cheap eats.",383,tourists
384,67,896,It is a great place mainly for eating. The place is jam-packed with food stalls serving tasty treats at reasonable prices. However majority of the food is of the oily kind. It is not really a shopping place for tourists. The shopping caters more to the locals for the raw ingredients and traditional clothes and medicines. But it is an eye opener. It situates right next to Dongdaemun which is definitely a tourist shopping haven with shops in Migliore open till late like 4am.,384,tourists

You can get a variety of clothes including Hanbok(traditional Korean costume) in a cheap and reasonable price, fabrics, kitchen appliances and more. Another reason tourists visit is the food; Mayak Gimbab, Jeon(Koraen-style pancake), Sundae(pork roll), Jokbal(pork hocks), Tteokbokki(seasoned rice cake) and many more. Why don't you traditional Korean market food in busy and festive street?",385,tourists
386,69,925,"As a traditional market that you would go to in order to buy stuff, this particular market specializes in clothing, whole cloth, traditional Korean clothing, tailors, shoes, blankets and bedding, etc. We saw a whole lot of stuff like that, in any event. But the real reason any tourist or foreigner would want to go there is for the food experience. The market is famous for their mung bean pancakes, but the various food vendors there sell all the different savory and sweet pancakes famous in Korean street food, as well as bibimbap and various fish and pork stews and sausages and things like that.  It's basically a foodie paradise if you're looking for the traditional korean experience of eating street food and common Korean food in public with real Korean people. There aren't as many tourists at this market as some of the more famous ones like Dongdaemun or Namdaemun, and if you go early in the day, like around noon or before, it's not crowded and you can take the time to enjoy a relaxing meal sitting on a bench at one of the many little food places that are crammed into this place. They also have clearly marked street signs throughout the place directing you to the various exits and subway stations and local landmarks and the food court area, as well as conveniently located bathrooms, although I can't vouch for cleanliness exactly. All I can say is they weren't the worst I've seen and they seemed to be easier to find and use than some of the other markets.  I went there with a friend and we stopped at the first place we found that had mung bean pancakes and ended up talking with an older Korean gentleman that was so friendly and liked us so much that he bought our meal after feeding us some of his soju and offering us his cigarettes. I will be going back so that if I see him again I can buy his meal the next time, as we agreed.",386,tourists
