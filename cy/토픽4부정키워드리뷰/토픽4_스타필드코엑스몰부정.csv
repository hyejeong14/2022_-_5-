1,1,198,"I agree with most that the architectural display out side the Starfield COEX Mall is impressive to say the least. But inside? That's another story. Low ceilings, very dole and depressive. We felt as encased for a lack of better words.  It does not represent inside the modernistic approach from the outside. The quality of the stores are really average and we believed that a structure of this kind would have design better stores and with better choices. Most things once again, cheap Chinese stuff, disposable value items and again the infantile South Koreans with stores filled with teddy bears (for adult people) cute cartoon printed made in China socks (for adults) and the distribution of the stores....very confusing.  Not a well planned mall and nothing to offer except for the Starfield Library, which is really pretty and impressive. Two floors library with lots of colors and places to eat. Basically the only highlight of the Starfield COEX Mall which is pretty average.  Except for the Starfield Library which you can access directly from the streets, the rest of the mall is a waste of pure time. Not recommended.",1,nothing
2,2,255,"Coex is very huge mall with lots of shops, restaurants and entertainment places like cinema, aquarium etc. However the best thing about this mall is the amazing libaray in the middle of the mall. If you tired after lots of walking at the mall, you can relax at the library even though most if the books in Korean. Shops are ordinary, nothing is unique and most of them is Korean product.",2,nothing

Upon stepping into the mall, we were so so impressed by the huge library which is located right in the centre of the mall. There is a mammoth collection of local and foreign books and magazines and the tall huge walls are lined with books as well. The library is very spacious with many seats available for reading and browsing pleasure. Besides the amazing library, Starfield Coex is a modern mall with everything shoppers need for fashionwears & accessories and services for all ages and also plenty of dinning choices. Understand that within this hige mall, there convention halls, cinema and aquarium. We didnt explore much as we were heading for other destinations given our short stay in Seoul.

17,9,300,"After visiting SM Town, we visited the COEX mall next door and decided to grab lunch at one of the many restaurants located inside. The mall is massive: there are lots of stores and restaurants that we didn't have time to check out. What I liked about this mall was the underground passage that connected to the mall. We were there during Christmas and it was snowing, but due to the underground walkways we were able to cross to the other side without any difficulties from the weather.",17,visited

All was good with good atmosphere, but there was confused because of complicated load. Need detailed road sign, I think.",18,visited
19,11,310,Ok I wouldn't call it the hidden gem of Seoul . The shops are expensive and I wouldn't have even visited the place if it weren't for a meeting near by. The duty free Lotte mall attached to it demands not only your passport but the return e tickets before letting you buy anything.. so if you want something from there keep the required documents with you.,19,visited
20,12,326,"visited here since it's one of the biggest malls in korea. wasn't really too impressed by the shopping. but if you're an SM fan, there's an SM Coex Artium area which has a shop (usually packed with fans) and all sorts of other things to do. Also there's a city airport on level 1 that has a money changer that provides pretty decent rates.",20,visited
21,13,333,"One of the interesting places to visit in Seoul is the COEX Mall.I would say don't miss it. The best way to get there from the city center, if you are taking the subway, is to take line 3(the orange line). Line 2(green line) will also take there, but line 3 takes less than 25 minutes.Take line 3 to Seoul university station and then take line 2 to Samseong station. Whenever you get out of the train look at the station and vicinity map posted on the platform to see the closest exit to the mall. As you enter the mall, make a right and you will see the information desk and a virtual interactive map of the layout of the mall.Check this out before you start exploring the place. Check the various restaurants and the food court before you decide to eat. Believe me, you wouldn't want to miss out on some of the best food in Seoul, all under one roof. Also check out the various retail shops, just browse, even if you don't buy anything, this would be an interesting experience. Once you are done with the mall, check out the area around the mall. There is always something going on.When I visited in September, there was a free K-pop concert ( Korea Sale Festa) going on near the mall.",21,visited
22,14,338,"This mall is very much like every other mall. There is a very good variety of shops and it has all the major skincare brands and make up brands. The clothes shops are also very trendy and cool.  The food malls have a large variety to choose from, the is halal food for Muslims, which is very convenient and new. Last time I visited almost 2 years ago, the wasn't any halal places to eat. Now there is, which I am very happy about!  The staff are very helpful and friendly. The location is very easy to find, right next to Samseong station.  The mall is located in a very nice area, very up and coming!",22,visited
23,15,354,"When we visited this mall I kept wondering: maybe it's just because I am an American. We walked and walked and walked and we never found really much of anything. It was very strange.

Not so at the COEX Mall.",23,visited
24,16,425,"The mall is located near the Samseong Metro station. This mall failed to impress us for numerous reasons. First of all, it's completely underground and feels totally claustrophobic. Secondly, it's incomplete and large parts of it are still being built. But most importantly - we visited the mall during the summer and parts of it (especially the parts still being built and renovated) were not air-conditioned. This resulted in unbearable temperatures inside the mall and the lack of ventilation plus the mass of people there made the entire experience uncomfortable, to say the least. While there are a lot of eateries around the malls, an aquarium, many shops, cinemas and pharmacies, we still could not escape but feel its gloomy atmosphere.",24,visited

But when I visited there, they were having renovation. Most of the shops were closed. Hmmm... But still you can find some shops opened. It would be very convenient if the weather is bad. But it's worth vising for those of you who have conference or business in COEX but if not, I recommend you to visit Garosu-gil instead.",25,visited
26,18,444,"Very huge mall with many shopping as well. But we didn't shop much as most are retail and departmental stores. They're better shopping areas like hongdae, ewha uni etc. We came to COEX mall for Marche, as it's world's no.1 marche which serves buffet! One pax for 23000W, what a good deal! And it's near Lotte World as well. I would recommend coming here if you're heading to Lotte World to have the marche buffet, if not probably not worth coming to the end of Jamsil Station.

27,19,460,"I visited the COEX mall after reading great reviews. Unfortunately there are major renovations happening until early 2014, and as a result there is not a lot to do. There are still some shops open, as well as the acquarium and cinemas, but there are better shopping areas available in Seoul. I think this will all be rectified when the renovations are complete",27,visited
28,20,464,"After visiting Lotte Myeongdong the night before, we went to Coex with anticipation. Coex Mall was huge with a few malls and departmental stores joined together in the underpass. However, the place had just begun its refurbishment when we visited and many shops and restaurants were closed since end Mar. Megabox cineplex, the Aquarium, Lotte Duty Free and the big bookstore were still opened. There were only limited local dining options. Coex looked like a mall from the 80s. The public bathrooms stink. Yes, Coex NEEDS the refurbishment.  We were quite disappointed by the Coex experience, really. Wish the hotel concierge could have told us and saved us the time (45 mins in evening peak traffic) to cab there from Gangbuk.",28,visited

It is one of two co-joined malls, also with two hotels, movie theater and much more. One can easily spend half a day there. So large that it is at times easy to get lost but lots of signage helps. Whenever we are in Seoul we go to this mall to stroll around and see whats new and interesting as well as to have a nice meal. Really one of the best in the city.",34,much

Building is long instead of tall. I do recommend to come here at least once for the amazing library design. Stores are ok but the library has amazing layout with gorgeous backdrop. Also a good place to come if it rains.",36,much
37,8,240,Seoul is famous for its markets but you can have a more relaxed shopping experience in Coex. I'm not much into fashion but I can stay for HOURS in the home section in ALand. It's got a huge collection of items from Flying Tiger Copenhagen which I love because they're fun and funky and oh so cheap. The food court offers a wide range of choices too!,37,much

The famous coex aquarium is situated within this mall. This mall has many entrance gates. It remains open till 10 pm (some of the shops start closing at 9:30 pm) after that only the restaurants remain open till 11. Many of the good restaurant s too close by 9:30 pm. So its better to visit this mall early in the evening. This mall houses many local as well as international brands. It is also a good place to buy some souvenirs though it will be a little costly. There are varieties of restaurants serving different cuisines of the world. One can get Korean, Japanese, European, Italian, American, Indian & Mediterranean restaurants there.",40,much

However, I feel that the way the shops are laid out isn’t very well-planned. You’d find an area with food in one corner, walk for another 10 minutes and find another cluster of food stalls at another area. The signage/directions are rather confusing at times and the place is too big, it can be a pain if you are looking for a specific shop and realise you have to walk around 20 minutes just to get to it. The developers could have built more floors instead of having almost 95% of all the shops on the same level. There are a lot of international brands as well, so shopping isn’t particularly interesting for me. I feel that guidebooks tend to over-rate this place way too much.",48,much
49,20,374,This mall was enormous! Full of expensive shops and a little less expensive shops that you see everywhere else in Seoul. The aquarium was a point of interest but we did not go because it's too much and if I wanted to see fish I'd go diving instead lol. There's a huge K-Pop shop/museum connected to it that was interesting. Our group wanted to see the Kimchi museum but it was no longer in the mall anymore.,49,much
50,21,382,"I'm not usually one for crazy shopping trips while travelling, but we made Coex Mall a destination when we found out about the Gundam Base retail store cuz we're nerdy like that.  So big that it has two different KTX stops that bring you to its front doors.  It's more of an upscale mall with a great variety of popular Korean and foreign brands (Uniqlo, Roots, and some European designers are all I remember off the top of my head) as well as smaller boutique stores. Also being in a very developed area of Gangnam as well as being a destination in its own right, everything is a little bit more expensive here, especially compared to many of the other underground malls that have more stalls than built-out stores.  The food selection has a wide variety of prices and offerings so you'll find something you like for sure. The Seoul Aquarium and a movie theater are also in the mall if you're not much of the shopping type.  All in all, covering the whole mall would take about an hour of non-stop walking. While stopping in a few shops here and there, you can get through it in 2-3 hours. If you're like my girlfriend, well, you can spend the whole day here pretty easily. We did this early on in our trip to Korea so it was a nice introduction to Korean mall culture and the local style, I guess.",50,much

52,23,408,"I liked COEX Mall before the renovation. It was smaller and had more of a vibe. Now it's huge but lacks any imagination. On a weekday it feels empty due to its expansiveness. On weekends, it's better. Unless you're there to watch a movie or visit the aquarium, there isn't much to do but shop and eat. I guess that's fine for most but I for kids, it can be a bit boring.",52,much
53,24,413,"I used to visit COEX regularly before the much needed renovation. Often for the Mexican restaurant (now shunted outside the complex), COEX had a charm about it, was always busy and had plenty of great looking young people wandering around. After returning to Korea I was excited to see that it had reopened and I ventured back only to find a sterile, brightly lit, overpriced and not very busy abomination. If you can imagine a sprawling airport duty free shopping experience, without the bargains then you've no need to visit. They killed COEX!",53,much
54,25,416,"When I was in Seoul last year, January, COEX Mall was closed for renovation. Since I was here again, but this time on business, it was convenient for me to visit as I was staying at Park Hyatt, plus there isn't much choice staying around this part of Seoul. And I don't have time not energy to visit the more diverse shopping areas after work.  There are many retail shops; restaurants and cafes are plentiful too, but they don't come cheap, so be prepared to spend.  I was here during early spring when it can still be quite freezing at times, so shopping underground, staying indoor worked well for me. But I know some people absolutely hate it coz it can be pretty claustrophobic.  Don't need to make a deliberate trip here, but if you are around the neighborhood, why not just swing by.",54,much

And if you are considering to stay at one of the hotels (Park Hyatt, the Coex Intercontinental or the Grand Intercontinental) in this area, you will certainly find the City Terminal in the mall particularly handy. (The travel from Incheon International Airport to the Daechi Dong area is a very long distance.) For international travel through Incheon, allow at least three hours before flight time. (We were told by the hotel we need 4 hours. But the Korean Airline desk set the record straight and told us 3 hours is sufficient) Our flight was 10:30am in the morning. We arrived at the city terminal a little after 7 am. Checked in our luggage and got onto an an airport limousine(bus) right away, around 7:15.
