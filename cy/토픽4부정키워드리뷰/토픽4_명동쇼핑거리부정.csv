1,1,52,Dont plan to go there during national holidays like the Lunar New Year 90 of the shops and restaurants were closed On the good side at least it wasnt crowded We just happened to be there not planned and just realized that nothing to see,1,nothing
2,2,244,Literally nothing much left. Food is still buzzing but shopping and street vendors are really sad... Not worth coming anymore.,2,nothing
3,3,320,Very interesting place to wonder around. So many shops and side streets full of shops. So many Korean beauty products and also Tom’s flavoured Almond shops. Also there is also a big Art box here as well. It gets busy during the day but that is nothing compared to nighttime when all the street food vendors come out. Please be careful because people will just push and shove when it’s really busy. That being said we still loved the place. Go and enjoy all it has to offer.,3,nothing

5,5,444,"With expectations set pretty high after watching loads of Youtube videos on this neighborhood, I was understandably left feeling 'eh' about it after getting a chance to experience this for a few days.  First off, I loved the vibe of the neighborhood, despite how crowded it became every night. That said, the neighborhood actually is not that big - two main thoroughfares, primarily, each maybe 4-5 blocks long. Lots of side streets with other shops and food options, but the main action really is on the thoroughfares. Lots of cosmetic shops, lots of cheap clothing of the Forever 21 quality level.  The street food was very much hit or miss, nothing completely mind blowing. Lots of repeat stands, but note that not all the stands have the same quality. I tried to use the length of the lines for each as a rough gauge on how good the stand may be - also a hit or miss approach.  Two tips and heads up (literally): - there are a lot of hidden eateries, cafes, and shops in all the buildings above ground level. really pay attention and look up to see what you may be missing out on! I found a few cafes that I loved - grab a coffee and a window seat and you can people watch all the action down below for awhile - garbage cans are really hard to come by. stay with the vendor you purchase food from and chuck your garbage with them after you're done, or come prepared",5,nothing

7,7,531,"This is probably the best street if you want to have some shopping in the very city center of Seoul. There're lot of stores, bar, cafè and restaurants, but in my opinion the fashion stores are too commercial and nothing special, they don't represent a good picture of the Korean style. Besides prices are higher compared to the other stores and bar that you can find in the city. Very recommended to young people or to people who like this kind of commercial tourism!",7,nothing
8,8,580,I expected much more from this place. It was basically streets of lots of facial stuff and nothing much more. The clothing and other stuff like electronics are sooo limited. Was a disappointment for me,8,nothing

There’s nothing like this in the states!",9,nothing

11,11,814,"Street that always crowds by people..nothing much i bought from here but i had fun with their 'pasar malam' atmosphere with new thingy that i had ever see. The most attraction i was looking for here is Spao. It is a boutique that must to visit by kpop fans though. You can enjoy everysing on the 5th floor, and dont forget to take sticker pictures with your bias. They offered awesome stuffs at affordable price. You also can visit everysing at apgujeong branch but you may feel regret if not buy anything at myeongdong branch which is the main everysing shop. M plaza also located in myeongdong, which Kimchi Academy is located, where you can book kimchi experience and hanbok wearing package. Hanji mirror making also including in the package with 30,000 won for 2 hours class. Classes offered in Korean, Japanese or English. They open for new package with ddeobokki making experience for 2012.  Popular Hello Kitty cafe also located here, that one i had skip on my last journey. will visit next time. Myeongdong also one of the place to buy sourvenir but no much choices and quite expensive that you can find the same thing at cheaper price at other market.",11,nothing

13,13,1038,"This area is heavily populated by Chinese tourists with large suitcases who sit in shops sending photos of items to their friends on Wechat. There's street food, but nothing you can't find in a less touristy area. My advice: avoid myeongdong like the plague - There's better places in Seoul for literally everything on offer here.",13,nothing
14,14,1201,"A "" must do"" in Seoul simply to experience all the different food stalls from pancakes to dumplings to octopus ... favourite was the meat filled korean dumplings ... awesome  And as opposed to the sights often seen in asian cities like Thailand , nothing seedy or concerning ... would recommend to do if you are Seould",14,nothing
15,15,1235,"My wife and I heard a lot about myeongdong, how the shops give away freebies like nothing, how attractive the sales are. We walked alone street away from the main street of myeongdong searching for face mask with heavy discount, and attracted by the discount signs outside one shop. Guess what? We didn't get freebies. The shopkeeper tried to talk us into buying face mask which are more "" premium"". And when I ask if there is tax free since I hit the 30k won, the answer was NO because the items were at discount. We were very disappointed. Where are the freebies that everyone talked about? When we went to Lotte Duty free shop, we saw the same items sold at same price, but can claim the tax. We are disappointed. Next time we will see where the crowd go, and stay in main street of myeongdong.",15,nothing
16,16,1248,"First time there. However, nothing special. Is the same like in any country. Selling lots of local delicacies. Clothing is more expensive than those selling in any outlets.",16,nothing
17,17,1304,"Love this place...night stalls and cafes and food establishments aplenty. Lots of shopping too. Personally, nothing beats the fact that it is such a vibrant place...especially at night. Plenty of hotels there and a good place to see Seoul by night.",17,nothing
18,18,1407,"This is one of the busiest shopping area for tourists. Beauty products and shops lined up in rows and alleys. Local apparel and shoes stores sprinkled in different corners of the street. You find the latest design of adidas and other popular sneakers here too !  Push carts of food lined the main Myeongdong street starting from the Zara stores.  We have an enjoyable time on Saturday trying tibits and food along this street. Don't take a heavy lunch. You just buy and eat from the push cart. They are hygienic at least for me and my Friend. We were fascinated by a push cart that sell nothing but just Optus and cuttle fish in various form ( grilled, dried and in a cup etc. We tried the pomegranate juice freshly pressed into a plastic bag and a straw. It looks like a fresh blood bag from a blood bank. But the taste is not as sweet as during winter.  We also shop along the way and got bags full of different Brand’s of facial cleansers, masks and facial mist, hair masks etc. There was a Watson store that sell interesting tibits and cosmetic too(items which you can't find in singapore but expensive when purchase online.  A lot of eateries are on the second and 3rd stories of the buildings. Fried chicken, Korean food, Osulloc tea cafe, beer and fried chicken place.  This is a must go place for whoever comes to Seoul. Just to feel the vibe and craziness of the buying bulk of skin care products from tourists from all over the world.  I see more European tourists hovering around the snail based skin care and masks products. Seems like snail is not just for eating, it is for beauty too !",18,nothing
19,19,1412,"I went with my family to experience the street food culture. Because we were there for only one night we tried a variety of foods. None of them were amazing sadly.The best (to me) being the deep fried shrimp 새우튀김. The worst beight either the cup 'o flaverless watermelon or the chewy and flavorless Cheese Ricecake 치즈떡.  Being a holiday weekend, the street was crawling with tourists. I think I heard WAY more Chinese than Korean, not that its a good or bad thing. Also, it feels that the stores in Myeongdong cater to young female shoppers. Being a guy in his 30's there was really nothing for me to shop for.  Also, not a great place to bring young children because of the crowd and lack of things that interest them.  If your on a date, maybe a great place to check out.",19,nothing
20,20,1415,"It was our first family trip to S Korea and we picked Myeondong because of the positive review's from TripAdvisor. We picked Philstay명동 hotel which was ideally located in the Myeondong area, no frills nothing fancy as we were on a budget. The reviews/reviewers for spot on Myeondong is basically a huge shopping paradise ranging from inexpensive item's to upscale name brand's. Huge plus was that were on our hotel was on the street where they have the street foods at night, everything was so affordable around $5 or less and so delicious and so much variety. I would absolutely recommend experiencing this area of Myeondong to anyone!",20,nothing

22,22,1429,"This is definitely a shopping place, for food , clothes, comestic etc there are night market u can explore the food while shopping. Not too bad, is a commercial shopping street, nothing to expect.",22,nothing
23,23,1430,"Very convenient for buying Korean cosmetic brands - many stores of the same brand within walking distance of one another. Take your time to test out products and the staff are usually very helpful ( if you speak Mandarin, staff can give product information in more details). Always ask for more freebies if you intend to buy larger quantities. If you shop at Aritaum, Olive Young, Innisfree and Too cool for School and purchase at least KRW30,000, you get immediate tax refund off your purchase price- so no need to claim tax refund at airport. But do confirm at the cashier before making payment.  The food stalls at the shopping street are not cheap and quality so-so. Better off saving the money and eating at more established and quality eateries in vicinity.  There are many stores of established hair salon chains in the area where you can rest and do your hair in between shopping. There should usually be someone who can speak Mandarin ( I went to a salon early one morning and the Mandarin speaking staff wasn't around and they telephoned a translator to speak with me so they could understand what style I wanted(nothing Beats showing them a picture though ) - talk about service !) or very basic English. Prices are not much more expensive than Singapore.",23,nothing
24,24,1458,"The most shopper friendly shopping street with food and shops at every corner. It was rather easy navigating the streets too unlike other districts where you feel like you are going round in circles or there is nothing much to do. Plenty of food push carts along the way too. They have a 3 level Nature Republic and Olive Young, a good place to get your seaweed snacks also. On top of that you can get a clear view of the Seoul Tower.",24,nothing
25,25,1563,"I'm not quite sure about the attraction of Myeongdong. Food? There are a few good restaurants but nothing that really stands out. Shopping? There are a few good stores, but nothing that I can't get anywhere else in Korea. When I first came to Korea 5 years ago, Myeongdong had a larger variety of stores and restaurants. It was a place you could go on a date, watch a movie, walk around, do some shopping or chat at a cafe. Now it is an over crowded tourist trap. The big cosmetic stores really killed the joy of this place. It seems like all the stores sell the same thing, and it is the same cosmetic stores in every direction, which you can get almost anywhere in Seoul. And the worst part is this shopping street is very crowded. If you do have to cross this off your list of places to visit, then the are a few things that I would recommend, Myeongdong Kalguksu restaurant, the Catholic Cathedral and Ouga Korean BBQ restaurant.",25,nothing
26,26,1596,"Most stores give samples and freebies when you buy there (there were two that did not give us anything but we had huge discounts of like 50% so that's fine). Other places may offer some samples and freebies but nothing beats cosmetics/skincare shopping at Myeongdong. The shopping is awesome & there are lots of street food stalls, although it's more expensive than other places, possibly due to the large number of tourists in the area. There are money changers near the China Embassy if you need more money and Lotte is just opposite the street if you want to buy high end stuff. Must go even if you're not buying stuff - you can just eat there too, plenty of food options!",26,nothing
27,27,1647,"Surprisingly for such a busy well known tourist attraction, the stores around here for shopping close at around 10pm. There's so much people in each store and in every cosmetic store everything is mainly sold to cater to the many Chinese tourist that come to visit the city, which only buy in bulk and nothing else. I personally do not like the foreign crowd this area attracts and find it too busy to enjoy the shopping. I would definitely recommend going to the less busy areas to meet your shopping needs as most Korean cosmetic brands can be found everywhere. They do tend to hand out more samples while walking the streets but tend to find that they hesitate on whom they give it to. Worth checking out but not the best for finding deals and bargains unless you love to fight the crowds!",27,nothing

35,35,2111,Myeongdong literally 'bright cave' or 'bright tunnel' but it is really nothing like a cave or tunnel but it is bright all right. Bright all night with the wonderful aroma of street food and great shops for good bargains for all things under the sun.,35,nothing

38,38,2193,"Maybe it is only because I am a guy but this shopping area was nothing special for me. During the day time it is a bit more leisurely but at night the streets become much more narrow because of the food vendors and it seems busier. I did find that there are multiple shops from the same company located in this center which kind of confused me but what the heck,....I am a guy. I also found out that there was no haggling over prices there. You don't like the price, goes elsewhere. Street food vendors were ok but a bit pricey. Had grilled lobster from one of them that ran around 15,000 won which is between $13 to $15 US. But what the heck is cheese on it for???? I would rather have had butter!",38,nothing
39,39,2347,"We took a nice hotel in this area after hearing about this ""wonderful"" shopping district. The hotels and surrounding areas are quite nice and elegant, but those shopping streets are more like a flea-market that is run mostly by Chinese... Location is still nice and central, but there is nothing particularly interesting to buy here and no decent restaurant for regular tourist.

41,41,2453,"True, there is nothing that sets this shopping street apart from any other in Asia, but I had nice strolls at different times of day. The street food was tasty, I felt safe, and enjoyed watching the people. I treated myself to some Korean lipstick as cosmetics are all the rage. You can find almost anything there and in every price point all around this area.",41,nothing
42,42,2460,"Like any other big city, the shopping district can be a rather interesting experience and the Myeongdong area in Seoul is not different. In my opinion, this is nothing special - there's a ton of people and stores selling everything between heaven and earth, most of which seem like rubbish quality. In terms of safety, Korea in general is a plus. Not at one time, did we fear anything and even when crowded, it's a safe place.",42,nothing
43,43,2535,"Myeongdong is always a good location for tourists due to its proximity to city center, many shopping and restaurants, as well as plenty of money exchange with best price.  It is a paradise for girls/women as there are many skin care and fashion shops. The shops close late at night so there plenty of time for making choices.  The apparent good side is exactly its shortcomings. There is nothing else to do from shopping skin care. It is actually small and one can walk through every single alleys within one hour. If shopping skin care is not the ultimate purpose, Dongdaemun in fact has a design complex which adds a bit more cultural content. For vibrancy and youth culture, area around Hongik University is my first pick.",43,nothing
44,44,2761,"I don’t usually like shopping streets. Shopping is not in my DNA.  Myeondong Shopping Street was for me more of an eating street with plenty of roadside stalls, than shops.  I tried the lobster - nothing fabulous. Can skip.  Egg bun was delicious!  Children found the sausages too peppery.  Strawberries were incredibly sweet.  But I had to say that my spirits were dampened by the sight of a disabled man crawling on the streets. It was a pitiful sight and I wonder why there weren’t more people who donated?",44,nothing

47,47,2891,Maybe I'm missing something but i don't understand the hype? This is simply another 'high street' in a different city/country. There is nothing unique. Its is extremely busy and to be frank offers nothing in the slightest bit unique...,47,nothing

51,51,3280,"...yet nothing I really wanted to buy. I was told ""if it's not in Myeongdong, it's not in Korea"". It gets a bit repetitive tending towards boring if you don't want to buy bags, hats, womens clothing or jewelery",51,nothing
52,52,3362,"Myeongdong was an absolute madhouse and I enjoyed every second of it. We did very little actual shopping here but visited three times just for the fun of it. At night, the main street had a couple dozen food stalls. I tried about five of them one night and they were all delicious. If nothing else, you've got to come here to experience the mass of humanity and light and sound.",52,nothing

55,55,3456,"I have to say it's always interesting to come to Myeongdong. It's always changing. Most visitors are tourists but locals come here too. You can find most of the shops and stores in Myeongdong in other malls or areas in the city. But the experience of shopping outside with street food and merchant vendors make this area an interesting place to come. I recommend coming here at night time with some appetite and roam the alleys and try various foods. Bring cash (Korean won) to make things more easier. You will easily get full trying many types of foods. The food vendors are general clean and nothing crazy or weird food. Also there's many restaurants as well but too many to pick from! Finding a public restroom could be difficult but if you go into large shopping centers or coffee shops, you will be fine. It's family friendly but it gets crowded. I would say myeondong is more for shopping at known brands such as makeups and shoes while dongnaemun is more for local merchants and clothes. There's definitely a different feel. I think you can give yourself about 1-2 hours to go through myeondong streets/alleys.",55,nothing

58,58,3817,"Myeongdong is a must visit for tourists even if you aren't a shopper at heart, you can still enjoy the street food and just experience the madness! Make sure to visit Sulbing (upstairs above one of the 10 Nature Republic stores) and enjoy the Hello Kitty Cafe.

60,60,3955,"Waves and waves of tourist...all the shops looked the same. Repeated shops on different streets and they all sell the same products. Young women & men will stand outside the shops trying to promote their products. It's a skin care heaven shopping place for ladies ! There are many cafes, money changers too. I like the ""food hawker"" selling bbq squids, sweet paste coated fresh strawberries, the famous 32cm long ice cream on a cone. I was told that an average of 1,000,000 person passes through the street of Myeongdong. Not a place for young children or parents with prams.

Before the shops are people trying to get you to come inside the shops and give you masks as a treat, especially on the weekend. Honestly nothing bothered me there and I knew the place was good to get CDs for a good price. It is after all a shopping street and as such one should see it. The shop assistants are good with English, Japanese, Korean and Chinese. Was a fun place to stroll around and just explore.",61,nothing
62,62,4319,"For the shopaholic, it's paradise. Designer stores aplenty, with a phenomenal range of food outlets and restaurants.

There will be repeats of many standard makeup stores, and there are a couple of clothes stores but nothing quite sales-y like the street fashion in the underground stores. However, the store clerks are well-versed in either Mandarin or a bit of English and are super-attentive to your needs.  I dislike the crazy crowds that come here, but it would be a must-visit if you must shop in Seoul. I preferred going to Hongdae or the underground malls for my shopping thrill.",63,nothing
64,64,4403,"The shops are fine but really nothing you can't find in a hundred other places.

71,71,5017,"As another reviewer said, there are a ton of Korean cosmetic shops here! I saw probably 2 or 3 shops for each brand, and I think they outnumbered all the other kinds of shops combined. So, if you're looking to stock up on some fantastic Korea beauty products for half of what they would cost to order them online, this is the place for you! They also lure you into the stores with free samples, although you don't have to buy anything. There are other kinds of shops if you want to take a look around, but nothing special. Mostly over-priced clothes and souvenir shops. My boyfriend did get a very amusing hat here though....",71,nothing
72,72,5107,"My friends and I went to Myeongdong many times, and we got very bad experience there. We do like shopping and dining there, but somehow they'll show their temper / unfriendly attitude if you just buy little stuff or nothing to buy in the shop. Not only retail shops, but restaurants. So-called shopping paradise, just so so.  對於旅客來說，明洞係一個非常出名的購物地點！但係如果在店鋪只消費少少或者完全無消費，售貨員就立即黑面、發脾氣！這裡絕對稱不上係一個購物天堂！所謂的購物熱點就是這樣！",72,nothing
73,73,5169,"Its was really cold in winter therefore wear proper winter clothes especially young children. It does get crowded but being in asia its nothing surprising.  Moreover there are lots of variety such as designer brands, local brands and market like stalls. I would recommend a whole day to fully explore the place and the street food there is good and there are heaps of places to eat and have a cuppa. I would recommended anyone who would like to buy pressies to bring home stop by here also.",73,nothing
74,74,5170,Myeongdong has lots of shopping and for beauty products at least 3 or 4 of the same shops. If you head downward there are a tonne of restaruants serving all types of food. But there is nothing better than a good Korean BBQ.,74,nothing
75,75,5195,"i love going to myeongdong, there so many cosmetic shop and delicious food. and you can shopping all around the time here. you must give space to long time here. becuse if you just going one or two hours here you get nothing. kkkkk",75,nothing
76,76,5215,really nothing to see here unless you are coming from a 3rd world country. Prices are high and you can find everything in other shopping malls.,76,nothing
77,77,5240,"Myeongdong has a long history. It's been a centre of shopping for Seoulites for years. But by 2000, Japanese started to occupy this area, and in recent few years all the tourists started coming to this area, and now it got to a point where you see more tourists than locals in the area. One of its attraction was that the area is all walk-only streets and cars are not allowed in. But now the downside is that it gets more people to fill the streets than the cars passing by, making it one of the hardest to place in Seoul to walk around. Now, it is a nice shopping district indeed. But that's if you want to hop in Uniqlo, H&M, Zara and all those global fashion brands which are available everywhere else in the world, and by the way cost more than most of other countries. Most shops are also available in many other downtown spots in Seoul, there's not a single unique shop that you can only visit in Myeongdong. Therefore, I wouldn't recommend this area so much. You can go once as a tourist attraction, but if you're looking for genuine items you can only get in Korea, I'd look elsewhere. You know almost everywhere in Seoul is extremely crowded but this area is one of the worst. It used to have history, but nothing is special now, except for Myeongdong Cathedral which is the best catholic structure you can see in Korea.",77,nothing
78,78,5382,"If you love Korean stuffs and a fan of these Korean telenovelas, this is a haven for you. This is Seoul's #1 shopping district for nothing, it got everything. No need for further introductions, upon arrival in Seoul, get a taxi and shop till you drop. Visited last Sep-12 during ""Experience Hyundai"" trip.",78,nothing
79,79,5384,"No matter you are a real shopper or only a window shopper; Myeongdong is really a ""heaven"" for you. The only problem for me is I found nothing to eat because am vegetarian.",79,nothing
80,80,5451,"Myeongdong is a commercial area and therefore it is less chance to experience the real korean shopping. Most of the shops have staff who speak different languages, eg mandarin, japanese, english etc to serve tourist from different country. This is one of the excellent service you don't find everywhere in the world.  Only shortfall is it is always too crowded, especially at night, one can hardly move around. One can try to come in the day, nothing much to see but can find some nice restaurant hiding inside the small lane.",80,nothing
81,81,5629,"This place was a bit of a letdown during my three days in Seoul after what I read about the place.  It had the usual high-end stores and the flashy neon lights. But there's nothing quirky about the place. No street performers, no people in weird costumes and nothing particularly unique, original or beautiful. It's just a straight up place to shop that you'd find elsewhere in Seoul and in most large Asian cities. It doesn't deserve its reputation for being the ""most see"" place in Seoul.  Maybe it's good for the ladies who love shopping. But as a guy, I found it nothing more than a decent photo opportunity.",81,nothing
82,82,5697,"Street that always crowds by people..nothing much i bought from here but i had fun with their 'pasar malam' atmosphere with new thingy that i had ever see. The most attraction i was looking for here is Spao. It is a boutique that must to visit by kpop fans though. You can enjoy everysing on the 5th floor, and dont forget to take sticker pictures with your bias. They offered awesome stuffs at affordable price. You also can visit everysing at apgujeong branch but you may feel regret if not buy anything at myeongdong branch which is the main everysing shop. M plaza also located in myeongdong, which Kimchi Academy is located, where you can book kimchi experience and hanbok wearing package. Hanji mirror making also including in the package with 30,000 won for 2 hours class. Classes offered in Korean, Japanese or English. They open for new package with ddeobokki making experience for 2012.  Popular Hello Kitty cafe also located here, that one i had skip on my last journey. will visit next time. Myeongdong also one of the place to buy sourvenir but no much choices and quite expensive that you can find the same thing at cheaper price at other market.",82,nothing
