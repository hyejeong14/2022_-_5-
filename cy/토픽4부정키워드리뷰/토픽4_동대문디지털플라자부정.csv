It reflects the light from surrounding buildings & looks quite otherworldly. Well worth a brief visit.",20,surrounding
21,9,351,"This place simply has to be seen to be appreciated. The design is on a large staggering scale and surprises when compared to the many tiny alleyways that are in surrounding neighbourhoods.

Inside an almost all white walkway spiraled up to the top floor making for a long walk along the outer circumference of DDP. A staircase with an oddly angled and brown contrasting steps brought us back down.  The building and surrounding areas were open 24 hours a day. I walked around for free inside but to visit any of the exhibits or museums you just had to pay an admission fee (roughly W16000 for adults). On the ground floor was a temporary exhibit on Disney animation which seemed to be quite popular. There also was a Disney store and lots of silkscreened animation scenes from the likes of Frozen, Big Hero 6, and Moana. On the second floor was an art museum. On the third floor was a children‚Äôs play area, some collaboration space and on the roof, a viewing area and a cafe. In the back was a lush landscaped area with seating, a piano and various art pieces. In the front was a large courtyard where lots of people were congregated.

There are not too many shops inside the building, though. But there are a lot of stores surrounding the DDP where you can do your shopping. Worth the visit.",28,surrounding

If you are into photography, it is a fantastic place to practice your depth of fields and length snapping, but it's nothing compared to the palaces you have on offer a mear 3 or 4 stops away in Jonggak or City hall.

Designed by the late internationally acclaimed Pritzker Architecture Prize recipient, visionary Zaha Hadid, Dongdaemun Design Plaza, frequented by both tourists and locals, greets all with the notable humanistic art of architecture. It imparts a feeling of liquid, fluid metal. Seoul, the capital city of South Korea, home to 10 million people, is a modern world mega-city, designated in the year 2010 as the ‚ÄúWorld Design Capital.‚Äù It is indeed fitting that he Dongdaemun Design Plaza so elegantly captures the beauty and energy of Seoul.  The Dongdaemun Design Plaza is home to the Dongdaemun History and Culture Park, featuring the Dongdaemun Relic Area 2, an archaeological site discovered at the former baseball field of the Dongdaemun Stadium Complex, yielding knowledge about the life of Korean people during the Joseon period. The tile-paved path believed to relate to the Japanese colonial period connects the building sites and the Well Site and Fireplace Feature depicted along the path. The dual-languages of the signage of the site are Korean and English. In the midst of this extraordinary mega-city of Seoul, resides peace and tranquility.  The Dongdaemun Design Plaza also is home to eateries, coffee shops, art, gigantic sculptures, a rooftop park, bi-lingual tours of the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, and so much more to experience.",57,much

The shopping area was billed as a design market, it was not at all curated as ‚Äúdesign‚Äù goods. The remains of historical buildings in and amongst the futuristic mega buildings were the most interesting parts of the park. Overall, the sheer bleakness of the interior was fascinating, but I was very frustrated at the lack of museum content. The one small exhibit gallery with exhibits in it was okay, but not of a scale to fit this giant park. So, be aware that besides the giant swooping building, there isn‚Äôt anything else to see.  The central stair in the design building is amazing, there is some striking architecture.",60,much

Lots of stores as well, including a LINE Friends one that was super interesting to check out and do some souvenir shopping at. Not sure it this would still be here but there were also lots of pop-up pianos that you were welcome to use and created a really awesome atmosphere.

It was no one I recognized and I think they were rehearsing for something later in the day or evening. It definitely seemed like things were still being set up. The subway stops right at the DDP, so it's convenient to get to via subway. You could spend so much time just taking photos outside before even going inside to explore.

I like Namdaemun market more than Gwangjang market because the street food is better. I'm not a big souvenir shopper so once you see 1 market, they're pretty much the same except for the food variety. If you're tight on time, you can stay in this area and skip Myeongdong and Namdaemun. They're pretty much the same but this area is cleaner and more modern.

But we did share a churros , which was awesome!! Crunchy on the outside with a soft chew fluffy insides .  Besides foodtrucks, there were selfmade artist selling their arts and also a blowup balloon arts that was everywhere .. a very good night out and loads of photo Opp's.!! Do checkout this is on the weekend. The night life from cheonggyecheon river to the malls opposite the DDP seems like its always busy with something during Saturday late evening to night... =)  TIPS: for those who doesnt have much time to spare in korea.. these places are all within walking distance to checkout - Cheonggyecheon River end - Grill Fish street - Dongdaemun Shopping Malls -Multiple BIngsu places -multiple Train stations nearby - if you come in the morning even have a historical landmark too""forgotten the name"". sorry... but the DDP is quite central easy to make it a landmark ""In-Case-Of-Lost"" among a big group.. =).
