13,13,287,"A local market where you can find many shops selling souvenirs, snacks and fashion. It includes many streets with different zones. Enjoy strolling along the streets.",13,long
14,14,301,This market is ideally located and can easily be found . It is long stretch of market stalls that would fit everyone's liking. Prices here are affordable compared to other markets i've been to in Seoul. Vendors may not speak fluent English but will still accommodate every buyers inquiries.,14,long
15,15,302,"I spent a week in Seoul about 3 years ago and would stop by this market to grab some freshly deep fried red bean buns etc. for my morning walk up namsan park.  Because I fly through ICN a number to times a year, when I have a long enough layover, would head into the city for a quick hike and revisit of the market.  Have been quite disappointed the last 3 visits this year. The same vendors that were friendly and smiling are no longer. And have become short and abrupt.  The first time, I chalked it up to an off day. We all have those. But 3 times within 6 months, don't think it is a coincidence anymore.  I don't know if it is because they have become tired of tourists or something else. But it leaves a bad impression and I won't go back.  The young people who walk around as ambassadors of the market are still very friendly and helpful.",15,long
16,16,328,"Huge market with loads of clothes, food, souvenieres, etc. We spent about an hour walking around window shopping and eventually bought a few things as well. Loads of knockoff brands sold, make sure to bargain! Lots of small side streets that I think are really worth it to go down, there are some really tiny restaurants with some amazing local Korean food. A lot of the shops closed down at around 6pm, but a lot of the street food vendors set up around 5 and that was definitely very worth it! A lot of amazing food for very reasonable prices, and a great taste of Korean culture along the way.  Metro line 4 takes you straight to the market.",16,long
17,17,342,"Most shops are clothing, but this place is pretty big with several blocks of streets and alleys. Along with basements and multi floors of stores after stores.  From my group, lots of ladies bought many skin care product, souvenirs and food here.",17,long
18,18,343,"It is a traditional Market place with shops and street vendors . We bought some socks , sun hats and dried fruit. I also saw some knock off clothing and bags along with fur coats . There were also food vendors and we got to try some traditional korean soup. Overall an interesting place To see for those who want to experience a more local vibe",18,long
19,19,346,"Loved the market. One can easily spend half a day window shopping or shopping and trying out some street food. Pity that we got to spend only a couple of hours there since we were specifically looking for luggage. Would have loved to browse through the shops much longer and walk around. Definitely go there while visiting Seoul. Price wise, I did not see any great deals, some shops are open to bargaining and some are not. Nothing was really marked down. Nevertheless a great place to browse and look at things that you do not need :)",19,long
20,20,351,"A good place to walk around as it is a big market which sells a variety of things from food to clothes to Kitchen utensil. However, encountered some unpleasant experience with some store owners. Who only focused their attention to Japanese tourist. Where I was in the midst of considering to make a purchase and a group of Japanese came along, the store owners just left me abruptly and attended to the Japanese.",20,long
21,21,381,There were some good bits to visiting Namdaemun markets . We didn?셳 see the deep fried baby crab anywhere else and the dumplings were excellent. The busy hot and narrow food alleys with kitchens along the walkways were a sight to see if not too enticing to eat at. Nevertheless I thought the Gwangjang Market had much better food quality and variety and the Myeongdong street stalls had much more atmosphere in the evening so if you were time pressed I?셝 do these first.,21,long
22,22,393,"If you are in Seoul, you definitely need to check out their markets. It is organized chaos and something to behold. All manner of food stuffs (although seaweed seems to predominate) and ready to eat street food vendors. One of my guides indicated there were some 27,000 retailers here. All small shops. The quality seemed good for the most part. It was fun to get a little container of fried crabs and just walk around munching and seeing the various wares. Beware though, there are very few garbage cans so be prepared to carry your empty containers for a while. All the items are quite cheap. The crabs were 5000 won (about $5 USD) for a big tub. It is just a short walk from the main Seoul Railway station along the elevated walkway, the 7107. There are other shops selling clothes, tools, and souvenirs as well.",22,long
23,23,404,Food and clothing stalls in the middle of the road and stores along the street. Place for cheap clothes and local food.,23,long
24,24,440,"Although I didn't buy anything there, it's a great experience to browse the different items for sale. As I was walking around, I found the dumpling people are talking about in Tripadvisor. I bought all types of dumpling to try.....yummy! If you eat there, you can help yourself with the danmuji ( yellow pickled radish) which are placed beside the stall. There are no chairs and you have to stand and eat. Along the lanes are small restaurants. If you are adventurous, you can go in and try the local food. If you stay in Myeongdong shopping area, you can walk to Namdaemun market - less than 900 meters.",24,long
25,25,458,"Went there by bus number 3 from Namsan Seoul Tower, 6 stops only. Quite a big market, as went during winter month of December, too cold to stay too long. Have good kimchi buns, fish cakes soups & food Valley with seatings to eat in comfort. Many shops to see, can bargain a little if buy more. Not all welcome bargains.",25,long
26,26,468,"We arrived in the early evening on a Monday, and noted that some of the shops on the peripheral were selling produce that locals were buying. Walking along the vibrant streets in Namdaemun Market, you will see many shops selling souvenirs, clothing, etc, as well as street stalls selling local food. Worth a visit to see a street market in Seoul.",26,long
27,27,482,"I stayed near this traditional market during a recent visit to Seoul and visited three times. Huge, the place has eight numbered gates; more than 10,000 stores in buildings and stalls; merchandise ranging from flowers to military equipment; and food carts. It seems to be the liveliest in the morning, when I encountered thick crowds, and rather quiet in the late afternoon. The market obviously attracts shoppers, based on the transactions I saw taking place, but also visitors with cameras, soaking up the atmosphere and enjoying photo ops.  I went for the atmosphere but ended up returning to seek out inexpensive souvenirs, such as bookmarks and fans. Though I looked at other items, including clothing and accessories, nothing appealed. Much better quality can be found in nearby department stores but with higher prices.  My favorite part of the market proved to be the ubiquitous food carts, where vendors prepare all kinds of yummy-looking fare. I finally got in a long line waiting for a hotteok (deep-fried veggie pancake) by Gate 2. It took about 20 minutes before I could put my order in and I received the hotteok almost immediately. The cost was 1,000 KRW, about $1 U.S. I stood on the street, eating this tasty delight and savoring every bite.  It is easy to get lost in this complex of pedestrian streets and buildings, so I suggest getting a map from the market's information kiosk before starting to explore. Enter from Gate 2 at Namdaemun-ro or Gate 5 at Toegye-ro. The kiosk stands on the street that connects the two gates, near the souvenir shops.  Namdaemun Market is easily accessed by subway (lines 1, 2, 4) and many bus lines. It takes about 15 minutes to walk there from Seoul Station.",27,long
28,28,485,"This review will focus on Kalguksu Alley or ?쐍oodle alley??that is inside the Namdaemun Market. It is difficult to find. I had a local Korean friend with me and we had to ask about 4 people. It was kind of fun to find because it is literally hidden. I would recommend using a maps app and not giving up. Once you do find it take a seat at any of the many soup stalls. You?셪l be knocking elbows with fellow eaters. There?셲 no way around this due to the very small space and high demand of the food served. The alley is only about 20 yards long. Most stalls serve soup noodles and bibimbap. When you?셱e finished, pay and leave. There will probably be people literally standing behind you waiting their turn. This is an ?쐎nly in Seoul??type of experience. Please try it.",28,long
29,29,501,"There is this old lady (ajumma) who sells almonds and all the real o brownie cheaper than anyone else in seoul. I compared prices across lotte, gs25, 7-11 and all the other stores but hers were the cheapest and has the same expiry date as others.  She was very kind and she offered us to try the almonds of various flavours for free. I took a photo of her stall which I will share once I find it. Her shop is very small and narrow along the main street down Namdaemun market.",29,long
30,30,512,"Looks like this is the best market in Seoul as it?셲 been going for a very long time. Street food here is great, lots of options and the donuts were unreal. The clothing is pretty terrible and there is a lot of supreme stuff that is clearly fake. Worth a visit tho for the atmosphere.",30,long
31,31,532,"It is a place I think everyone should visit, but this thing is over hyped big time. Yes there are lots of vendors, most of them selling the same ?쐓tuff.??I went because I wanted to try some street food, but I didn?셳.. I understand Kimchi is the most famous dish in S Korean, but the smell of it makes me sick, which is weird because I love cabbage. Needless to say with the lack of shopping for anything worth buying and the constant smell of Kimchi, we didn?셳 make it long.",31,long
32,32,556,"This market was located opposite our hotel so it was very easy to access. The market seems to sell pretty much everything including clothes, kitchenware, fruit and vegetables, cooked food, hats, shoes, souvenirs etc. The market is actually quite large and there is a part called ""children's market"" but it had already closed by the time we were there. In front of the market along the main road are many shops selling camera gear, new and used lenses and camera bodies including all the famous brands so I think this was the main place for cameras in Seoul.  Despite being quite a large market there are far more interesting markets in Seoul such as the Dongdaemun Market for fashion and the Myeong Dong Street Market which was very lively and seemed much more popular.",32,long
33,33,583,"Food and shopping are the best. Local food and wholesale is found here, walking distance from Mydeong shopping area, grab a sandwich along the way, shoes n shirts at cheap price. Be prepare to walk and enjoy the fun of shopping, step into the aircon building and open another area to shop.",33,long
34,34,588,"Nice place to see all fresh Korean food. Plenty of vendors convince you to get some food. During winter they'd provide heater under the long chair which it was nicely warm. They are selling dumpling with the soup (Mandu), blood pudding (sundae), raw octopus, chilli pickled cabbage (kimchi), hot&spicy rice cake (toppokki), Korean sushi roll (gimbap), etc. Very convenient to reach as it located in the centre.",34,long

42,7,274,I am not one for markets. I came as it is apparently one of the largest and that it certainly was! We got lost. Local junk. There was nothing good apart from the odd boutique jewellery store. Nice to see the locals and absorb the atmosphere. Some parts were not that clean.,42,nothing
43,8,332,"nothing much to buy here all selling the same thing, only one cart selling cheap souvenirs vs all the stores I checked out. The seller can even give me a discount since I buy more souvenirs. Bought 1 dress after I asked for a discount and fixed price for other stores for 1 cardigan and 1 shirt.",43,nothing
44,9,344,"There is much to see here. At first I was not interested as I had been to another market and I didn't really know why I would want to explore more stalls and why I would need numerous, inexpensive trinkets. Still, I kept walking and the next thing you know I was very interested in the market. It's interesting to see coffee shops, run by a single person, tucked between perhaps a little jewelry stand and a store selling hats. You will see all types of products, from leather jackets to $3 earrings. You will find all types of fried foods, being prepared right before your eyes. We'll find a complete alleyway of nothing but restaurants. Other food kiosks are scattered about. On one side of the market is fronted by quite a few camera shops and I even bought a lens. Well, I guess that says I was having a pretty good time.",44,nothing
45,10,361,"Big market selling lots of souvenirs and cheap wares. Plenty of food stalls to try, but avoid the alley restaurants displaying their wax dishes and calling you in - we tried one and the dishes that arrived looked nothing like what was advertised, tasteless and we got only half the dumplings displayed for the same price - was then told the front displays were ?쐓amples??only. Then they pretended they didn?셳 know what to do with a credit card - asking for cash - when there?셲 their machine right there and finally put it through on the card to give us a proper receipt. Really dodgy.",45,nothing
46,11,380,"Maybe it was because I visited Nandaemun on a weekday evening, maybe it?셲 because I?셝 just come from Taiwan where the night markets are world-renowned, but this is a very unremarkable market selling a limited selection of food.  Besides fixed shops offering baked goods and pigs??feet, there are stalls selling skewers which average about 3,000-5,000 won. Each stall sells almost exactly the same selection at almost the same price. There are alleyways off the main streets in which you can find sit-down restaurants selling the usual Korean fare - bulgogi, noodles, cuttlefish etc. I went into one of these and had spiced cold noodles with boiled egg.  From the stalls I had rather some chewy octopus skewers and average chicken skewers, some bland fried shrimp and a nondescript sugared dumpling. I wouldn?셳 repeat the experience.  Overall I was really disappointed. Having lived in China I came expecting a high standard of street food but this was nothing to write home about. I have seen much better markets in very rural areas of other parts of Asia, so I was surprised at just how uninspiring this one was given that Seoul is such a large and international city. In fact I would venture to say it?셲 the worst market I?셶e ever been to.  As for the products for sale, they are primarily Supreme imitation hoodies and other paraphernalia, and trinket shops. I can?셳 say I find that kind of thing interesting but if you do you might enjoy that side of the market.",46,nothing

50,15,507,"This market was just opposite our hotel so we wandered over there on our first day, but have to say it was very underwhelming. Many of the goods looked to be straight out of China, not particularly good quality, the sort of things you can see in markets anywhere. There were plenty of street food stalls but nothing that really appealed. Most of the shops were packing up from 7pm and nothing much was open after 8pm, so visit during the day, or just head to Myeongdong instead.",50,nothing
51,16,546,This market is nothing but most of China made cheap goods. Only very few local made items are sold. A sweet made of flour and honey is the speciality and should be tried. It's even more amazing to watch how this sweet is made.,51,nothing

Almost ALL stuff there is very very poor manufactured trash that looks coming from a third world country. It is a kind of stuff you can buy in any city in the world such as mainly women's garments but I must stress it's all garbage quality while prices are like buying from a regular shop. There is some Korean look stuff like hats and fans and again only for women, but does it make sense going to Namdaemun Market? ALL stuff is without prices so you must be able to speak Korean and willing to bargain just to buy trash! There are also some shops which sell international alcohol but again there are no prices so in these cases I don't even bother asking the price but walk away. It was a very disappointing experience and frankly speaking I don't get why people on forums talk so much about this ""iconic"" trash & trash place!

Right across The Courtyard at Marriot, Namdaemun Market is made up of street stalls, shops lining the streets on ground level of old buildings and old shopping malls (selling wholesale clothes, jewelry etc). Just roam and explore, u will find surprises in every corner. Stuff mostly for kids and women, not so much for men. Chanced upon a mall that sell nothing but children clothes. They are meant to be for wholesale and pre-order but they do sell single pieces too. Saw so many of these children clothes selling at Doota Mall (Dongdaemun) at double or triple the price. Be sure not to buy them at Doota. There is also another mall that sells just clothes for adults. It?셲 hard to give directions as they are like hidden gems amongst the many street stalls. If u happen to be in the mall selling jewelry, don?셳 be alarm if the stall owners refuse to sell single pieces to you. They are for bulk purchases and pre-order.

Worth a visit if you are trying to get yourself a new pair of glasses, but you will probably be overcharged if you are a foreigner. Bring one of your Korean friends.

Actually I didn't try anything, but the smell was so delicious that you can bet it was something really traditional and tipical of that place. All inside the market there are many of these street food places, and you have the opportunity to try different dishes for a low price.

We found it to be much cleaner that the public markets in the Philippines and also a wide variety of street food and small eateries. We had some hot Korean Soup in one of them which was OK although we had to just look at pictures and point since nobody spoke English there. There was some fruit at an outlet on the sidewalk which I couldn't identify... it might have been figs.. which we probably should have tried but didn't.

If this is what you're looking for, then it's definitely worth a visit. There are so many vendors that you could probably spend the good part of a day if you wanted to visit them all. However we spent less than an hour because it just wasn't for us; the crowds were extreme and most of them tourists, and stall owners would be calling us from every side trying to sell this and that - most of it things you would find hard to explain a real need for.  I do have to praise the food. It is cheap, and most of it is fresh and made before you. It's also eaten by locals which is always a good sign. I just didn't see much value in the shops' stock and didn't enjoy the busy tourist crowds. There are other markets I would rather frequent.",65,probably
