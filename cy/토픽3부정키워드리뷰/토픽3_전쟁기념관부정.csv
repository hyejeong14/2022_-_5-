0,0,265,I try to avoid war type memorials but this one turned out to be probably the best museum in Seoul Really good mostly unbiased review of the wars on the Korean Peninsula Enough english to keep it interesting The art pieces were particularly well though out and you cant beat the price free Id argue this is a must visit while in Korea,0,probably
1,1,320,We visited this with a South Korean friend but missed the English tour  nevertheless its an absolute mustsee for you to understand the recent history and current climate of this land We would love to return and join the English tour but lots of the signs and videos are in English so Im guessing we probably didnt miss too much information Such a poignantly expressed display we were deeply moved and touched by the depth of emotion behind the presentations No spoilers just make it a point to go and spend a few hours there  well worth your time,1,probably
2,2,421,I went the day after Chinese New Year but it was closed so I was able to go for a couple hours before my flight home The museum was very informative and provided a great insight into the history and how the war started and the role of the UN forces Upon entering I was greeted by what turned out to be an English speaking guide He was very informative but I had to part and rush through the remaining exhibits to catch my flight out Otherwise Id probably spend another couple hours there Highly recommended,2,probably
3,3,500,Its probably the best war memorial I have ever visited in any city or country The eye for detail is exceptional with a huge collection of war memories including a World War II fighter jet  Highly recommended and dont miss this place if you are in Seoul,3,probably
4,4,618,A very poignant and somber experience will hit anyone who enters this building as Korea tell their story about the wars that have inflicted the country including Japanese colonisation and the Korea War which inevitably led to the spitting of the country into North and South Korea and the countrys that came to South Koreas side in their time of need The museum is very big and will probably take most people 3 to 4 hours to get round entirely but there are some not worthy exhibitions including the donated articles and relics and the Korea War segment and all the vehicles outside The museum is free  there is free WiFi and there is a cafe for anyone who cant stand a 3 hour museum visit,4,probably
5,5,726,This is probably one of the best war museums I have seen in my life Great information provided and excellent exhibits Take your time to visit it ,5,probably
6,6,798,my friends and i came across a statue of brothers in one of the souvenir stores at the DMZ and googled to find out more about the background it brought us to the War Memorial of Korea and i must say its a great choice we made to visit it the next day  im not sure if its a permanent exhibition we visited end Oct and outside there were airplanes warships and tanks model replicas on display you can view a 7 min show depicting the confrontation between South and North in Year 2002 resulting in the death of 6 South Korean officers the show only starts with minimum audience of 5 but the lady staff was kind to let us view it even though we were only 3 if you watched it you can better understand the exhibitions held in the war memorial building  there is a shooting simulation game in the Korean history exhibition if there are students around you may get a chance to try it my friends did with a bunch of school students i tried later on but the staff rejected me and pointed to the students only signboard  inside you can view a 3D clip too initially they refused to start the clip as i was the only one waiting there but to my surprise they allow a caucasian couple to enter so unless you are caucasian or you can speak conversational korean you probably will be ignored i followed the couple in and a male staff wearing a suit manager maybe went to call for other visitors around a korean elderly tour group to join in  was told to fasten our seatbelts so we thought its those 4D shows where your chairs can rock but to our disappointment nothing happened the 3D clip was just a pilots view on a fighter jet NOT WORTH VIEWING  however there are many interactive screens and many wellmade replicas of various incidents and information on South Koreas involvement in the Worlds war assistance very educational  theres a cafe in the war memorial building serve desserts and waffles the souvenir shop sells similar items to those sold in DMZ  if you are into history this is the place for you,6,probably
7,7,840,To get here get off at Samgakji and take exit 12 there are signs Walk straight when you get to the street and the museum will be on your left  This museum is very large It as it typical of every country that has a museum of this type presents a nationalistic interpretation of the Korean War focusing on the heroism or the South Korea fighters as well as the international troops there is an entire wing devoted to the UN participant countries It has many maps and interactive touch screen displays that provide lots of useful information You will learn about the entire history of the war including politics and battles There are also lots of materials donated from soldiers so you get to see what items many people had with them during the fighting  There is also an extensive number of displays and monuments outside including a variety of military vehicles planes and boats used in the war  If you actually want to see everything outside and see every exhibit inside thoroughly as in reading most everything not just walking through quickly then you probably need more than 3 hours Otherwise you should probably plan for 90 minutes or 2 hours,7,probably
8,8,859,We got there just in time and joined the English speaking tour Our guide was very informative and it lasted about an hour After that we explored the museum We were probably there for about 4 hours,8,probably
9,9,955,The Korea War Memorial is an enormous place with a large War Museum built around it  Pros 1 If you are at all interested in the Korean War or how it led to modern South Korea this is the ONE place you should visit There is a fascinating audiovisual exhibition on the Korean War just inside the main building on the left And simply put It will explain EVERYTHING you could possibly want to know about the Korean War Youll understand How it came to happen What happened And from first principles youll understand very clearly how this has led to the modern South Korea of today Furthermore by understanding the background youll understand very clearly the current context behind the NorthSouth Korean situation And possibly its future ramifications  2 There is a wonderful outdoor exhibition as well demonstrating US and ExUSSR and Chinese military hardware from the mid 1940s onwards If you can think of a tank missile helicopter aircraft antiaircraft gun its probably here This is probably the SINGLE and most COMPREHENSIVE collection of postworld war 2 hardware in Asia In my humble opinion the only place youre going to find better is probably the Smithsonian Washington DC USA or the Imperial War Museum London and Duxford Cambridgeshire England  3 If you are interested in middleages Korea the basement is quite interesting There is a lovely replica of a Turtle Ship Geobukseon in the basement Worth visiting  Cons 1 You need to walk a little bit to get to the museum It took me about 510 minutes to find it The nearest subway station is Samgakji or Namyeong Stations 2 The military hardware is outdoors It started raining when I visited Thus I suggest you bring an umbrella or appropriate waterproofoutdoor clothes if you intend to spend much time looking at the outdoors military collection  In summary The War Memorial of Korea is probably the BEST War Museum in the whole of Asia You will not find a larger or better collection of military hardware in Asia To find better youll have to go to Washington DC in the USA or Duxford Cambridgeshire England  I spent 3 hours at the Korean War Memorial And only saw 2530 of the exhibits on offer This place is VAST You could easily spend the whole day here  To conclude if you are a family And you have a boy in your group below the age of 21 Just GO TO THE WAR MEMORIAL of Korea Your son will have more fun that the REST of your trip to Korea put together,9,probably
10,10,959,I can testify that in line with most other reviews on this this place is interesting and worth visiting It is probably built to remind the ordinary South Koreans of the need to defend themselves against the North  By reminding them of what happened in the past,10,probably
11,11,1023,Now i know why this is ranked number 1 This memorial is more like a museum with massive ranges of history from all around the globe There are also amazing displays of weapons machinery and everything you can basically think of from rockets to battleships The outdoor part of the memorial is a football field sized area with tanks planes rockets and various artillery weapons This War Memorial would probably be number 1 in the world is amazing,11,probably
12,12,1056,The War Memorial of Korea is a fantastic site in Seoul and probably one of the best military museums in the world There are basically 2 distinct areas to the monument  inside and outside  The outside consists of many different pieces of military equipment used by both sides during the Korean War Tanks planes artillery and a boat This is all really cool and in great condition You can really interact with some of these vehicles eg Sit in the drivers seat of and armored personnel carrier walk around the boat etc Theres also several statues to commemorate the war and monuments explaining the involvement and contribution of the various nations who fought with the UN against the North Koreans  The inside is an excellent museum which covers the Korean War as well as various conflicts beginning as far back as the ancient Korean kingdoms through the Japanese colonial period Lots of cool artifacts models and multimedia here Theres no entrance fee which was also nice  Overall its a great attraction which gives a comprehensive background on the militarypolitical history of Korea through the end of the Korean War,12,probably
13,13,1131,After 20 year overseas marriage with a Korean finally visited probably the most important site in Korea The amount quality and coverage of information superb Wish wed visited 20 years ago,13,probably
14,14,1198,I went the day after Chinese New Year but it was closed so I was able to go for a couple hours before my flight home The museum was very informative and provided a great insight into the history and how the war started and the role of the UN forces Upon entering I was greeted by what turned out to be an English speaking guide He was very informative but I had to part and rush through the remaining exhibits to catch my flight out Otherwise Id probably spend another couple hours there Highly recommended,14,probably
15,15,1249,The Korean War memorial is a massive site dedicated to those that fought and gave their lives to defend South Korea from communist North Korea and China The displays are awesome and the sculptures capture the struggles both South Korean soldiers and civilians endured throughout the war We saw hundreds of young military soldiers and students at the memorial probably to learn about the war and why they need to stay vigilant to protect their freedom Its remarkable how much South Koreans suffered during the war and how they rebuilt their nation to what it is today in just 63 years The memorial will forever remind future generations of the price of freedom You must visit this remarkable site,15,probably
16,16,1284,A lot of effort has been put in to this national museum Entry is free and one probably gains much more understanding than by a visit to The Border with the North It is in Seoul and easily accessible so no excuse not to visit for anyone with even the slightest interest in why Korea is the way it is today  The outside displays include an array of military hardware large enough to fight a small war collected from most of the nations which armed the 1950s conflict All including a full size B52 bomber shoehorned together in to a remarkably small area to make a massive 3D jigsaw The best view of all this is obtained from the deck of the heavily shell and bulletpitted gunboat which has found its way in to the ornamental lake in front of the buildings  All the nations flags and soldiers of the UN forces are commemorated in a huge memorial area  Koreans have a history of war to equal any European nation and this is outlined inside in an illustrated timeline covering several large rooms The internal displays include a horrific and moving portrayal of the Japanese occupation  We also saw many groups of South Korean school children all in their pretty uniforms being taken around the premises being introduced to the facts of Korean life and geopolitical circumstances Sad but essential,16,probably
17,17,1296,This is probably one of the best war museums I have seen in my life Great information provided and excellent exhibits Take your time to visit it ,17,probably
18,18,1371,The most popular attraction here was the tanks and planes available just outside the entrance Its great for kids and enthusiastic adults as it lets you climb up on top of a few of them allow you to take photos in front of them and marvel at just how huge these things look like close up There was an overwhelming amount of information inside the memorial itself so I spent an hour on the Korean War section and that was about all I could stand Being Australian it was interesting finding the list of soldiers who lost their lives in the Korean war  Just a tip dont order any food from the nearby onsite restaurant unless youre desperate for a meal as I was I grabbed a beef bibimbap and while it wasnt exactly inedible it was probably the worst meal I had in 2 weeks spent in Korea,18,probably
19,19,1463,In a country that has had more than its fair share of warfare and suffering the War Memorial should be at the top of every tourists itinerary in South Korea It takes the viewer back in time to explain how the Goguryeo General Eulji Mundeoks troops had routed a 300000 strong Sui army in 612 AD There are interesting early examples of Korean weapons systems that had changed the course of Korean historyThe Shin Gi Geon Hwa Cha was a wheeled rocket launcher than could fire 100 rocketpropelled arrows simultaneouslyThe carnage at the receiving end must have been terribleThe most outstanding Koreandesigned weapon system was the famed Turtle Ship A 125 scale model of it is on display It was brilliantly well designed by Admiral Yi Sunsin It was fully enclosed to protect the crew while the roof was covered with sharp nails to prevent an enemy boarding party from getting a foothold The very small sail probably meant that it could not travel very fast These ships had won Korea many a sea battle against the Japanese A large number of exhibits naturally cover the Korean War when Communist North Korea had made a surprise attack on the South and had overrun it in a matter of a few days The Republic of Korean RoK troops later jointed by the United Nations troops had fought back heroically to turn the tide It was General Douglas McArthurs famous Incheon Landing on 15 September 1950 that had turned the tide of war which later moved for the first time north of the 38th parallel The war finally ended when an armistice was signed Among the displays are captured North Korean weapons including a Russianmade MiG19 and an An2 transport aircraft Numerous poignant photographs of the peoples suffering form a wrenching experience There are numerous exhibits on the Korean armed forces of today An interesting one is a Koreandesigned light unmanned attack vehicle Outside the main buildingin the open are a range of aircraft that had been used by South Korea during the war These include a Cessna T37 trainer F5 F86 and F86D fighters A Curtiss C46 Commando and C123 transport aircraft and  amazingly  even an eightengined Boeing B52 bomber It is quite a sight It is quite an experience for those like this writer  who had lived through the Korean War Hormuz Mama,19,probably
20,20,1558,This is probably one of the best museums ive been too So many interactive models and so much to see Very interesting to way to find out about the Korean War,20,probably
21,21,1594,Probably a must see but I was not really thrilled Building is massive and you will go through the entire history of Korea through the wars that they fought since the origine of time Very little translation in English so you get bored rapidly There are some old military junk outside which probably will make kids happy,21,probably
22,22,1597,Place is alright Its free and definitely had some pretty impressive exhibitions  especially if youre a military history buff Ultimately the place felt way too propaganday for me It is quite apparent that the history is more about narrative More like something Id expect north of the border Still probably worth an hour or 2,22,probably
23,23,1713,I usually dont like museum so much but this one is probably the best Ive been to You can spend hours walking around and still loving it The direction is indicate on the floor so just follow it Ive learn a lot about Korea and Im considering to going back there again  And its all for FREE,23,probably
24,24,1769,Ive been wanting to visit this museum for a while because two family members were part of the UN forces in the 50s Today I finally had the chance I only had a couple of hours available but you could easily spend much longer It was a bit cold so I didnt have a chance to see much on the grounds but in warmer weather that would probably take at least another hour The museum actually covers more than just 195053 it includes history of the ROK armed forces and all of their contributions in UN peacekeeping efforts There is a written guide in English and other languages and most of the short video clips were also available in English and Chinese and Japanese as well as Korean There was an English tour available at certain times but I didnt take advantage of that The museum has many interesting exhibits with lots of information It is large but easy to navigate and there are restrooms on every floor There is also a cafe and small gift shop as well I would recommend visiting the museum if you have at least a couple of hours available Be aware that it is always closed on Mondays and holidays I got to the museum on subway Line 6 and got off at Samgakji station If you take exit 12 out of the station just walk straight ahead and you will come to the museum within a couple of blocks It was really easy to find and an easy walk from the subway station,24,probably
25,25,1789,I not a big fans of history and war But this place is a must visit for those who is visiting Seoul from overseas The sequence of the exhibits the interactive and technology fused with the history made it so interesting This probably one of the many best exhibits I have been to and the admission price is 0 You need a good 2 hours,25,probably
26,26,1810,my friends and i came across a statue of brothers in one of the souvenir stores at the DMZ and googled to find out more about the background it brought us to the War Memorial of Korea and i must say its a great choice we made to visit it the next day  im not sure if its a permanent exhibition we visited end Oct and outside there were airplanes warships and tanks model replicas on display you can view a 7 min show depicting the confrontation between South and North in Year 2002 resulting in the death of 6 South Korean officers the show only starts with minimum audience of 5 but the lady staff was kind to let us view it even though we were only 3 if you watched it you can better understand the exhibitions held in the war memorial building  there is a shooting simulation game in the Korean history exhibition if there are students around you may get a chance to try it my friends did with a bunch of school students i tried later on but the staff rejected me and pointed to the students only signboard  inside you can view a 3D clip too initially they refused to start the clip as i was the only one waiting there but to my surprise they allow a caucasian couple to enter so unless you are caucasian or you can speak conversational korean you probably will be ignored i followed the couple in and a male staff wearing a suit manager maybe went to call for other visitors around a korean elderly tour group to join in  was told to fasten our seatbelts so we thought its those 4D shows where your chairs can rock but to our disappointment nothing happened the 3D clip was just a pilots view on a fighter jet NOT WORTH VIEWING  however there are many interactive screens and many wellmade replicas of various incidents and information on South Koreas involvement in the Worlds war assistance very educational  theres a cafe in the war memorial building serve desserts and waffles the souvenir shop sells similar items to those sold in DMZ  if you are into history this is the place for you,26,probably
27,27,1819,The War Memorial of Korea is a very interesting place It a couple of blocks from the Samgakji Station Its one stop away from the National Museum and 1 or 2 from Itaewon station There is a large outdoor area with numerous outdoor exhibits that leads into the main building You could probably spend most of an afternoon here if not all day Many exhibits are interactive and interesting for children although its always about death and war Youll have to decide whether you want your kids to see it Outside by the foot of the stairway in front of the main building there are vending machines if you want more youll have to walk out a bit I recommend bringing drinks and snacks On the right of the building outdoors there are war vehicles Behind that is the childrens museum Im assuming there are more interactive things for kids as Ive never been in there,27,probably
28,28,1930,To get here get off at Samgakji and take exit 12 there are signs Walk straight when you get to the street and the museum will be on your left  This museum is very large It as it typical of every country that has a museum of this type presents a nationalistic interpretation of the Korean War focusing on the heroism or the South Korea fighters as well as the international troops there is an entire wing devoted to the UN participant countries It has many maps and interactive touch screen displays that provide lots of useful information You will learn about the entire history of the war including politics and battles There are also lots of materials donated from soldiers so you get to see what items many people had with them during the fighting  There is also an extensive number of displays and monuments outside including a variety of military vehicles planes and boats used in the war  If you actually want to see everything outside and see every exhibit inside thoroughly as in reading most everything not just walking through quickly then you probably need more than 3 hours Otherwise you should probably plan for 90 minutes or 2 hours,28,probably
29,29,1980,This is a really elaborate museum and very well done Theres so much to see and you will be here for hours Americans visitors will probably appreciate it most after Koreans The reason I mention Americans is because they are also heavily memorialised here too and you cant help but admire the apparent bond between the two nations I would recommend a visit if you have an interest in the history of war in Korea,29,probably
30,30,1983,We got there just in time and joined the English speaking tour Our guide was very informative and it lasted about an hour After that we explored the museum We were probably there for about 4 hours,30,probably
31,31,2001,The huge monument of statue of brothers welcoming every visitors moved me Korean families celebrating Memorial Day in their camping tents urban camping being a recent trend lining up the sidewalks of this huge complex of war memorabilia reminds me how proud this nationality of their culture and heritage This park is probably one of the best in the world a living testament how this once poor nation now a nation of great wealth was able to fight for their land and freedom Displayed were actual warships and planes armaments names of unknown soldiers including some of my fellowmen Filipinos who helped fought the Korean war How can you not be proud,31,probably
32,32,2049,The worlds largest war memorial it was really interesting and you can probably walk around for hours Great exhibits and best of all its free,32,probably
33,33,2072,If you like history of Korea especially its war history then this is the right place for you to visit The first floor was from prehistoric era so youll probably best to skip it but it is still not bad to see though Second and third level were for Korean War Vietnam war donated artefacts arsenals tanks howitzer and jets models Can spend more than 1 hour just to look at all the exhibitions there; more if you want to read all the explanations in details Do not forget to visit the park on the left since it contains more of real size vehicle models tanks jets tank destroyer etc A really good place to spend your time in Seoul There is no entrance fee close at 6PM can hire local tour guide there from inside the building,33,probably
34,34,2223,This would probably keep children entertained Interactivity occasionally came at the expense of a clear narrative of the war However definitely worth a visit if you have any interest in the history of the Korean war Do save time for the top floor exhibit on international involvement,34,probably
35,35,2245,The War Memorial of Korea is a great museum and one visit will probably not be enough to see mostall of it My fiance and I went on a nice autumn day and when we arrived we discovered that there is an exhibit outside of the museum displaying old USA South Korean North Korean and Chinese warplanes tanks submarines etc We walked around that part for about 12 hours and then had lunch at the cafeteria next door to the museum We decided we would check out some of the smaller exhibits and come back in the winter for the much larger the 625 War Korean War exhibit  It was a good choice because when we visited again a couple months later we spent a good three hours or so in the 625 War exhibit We didnt know much about the Korean War before entering but it was very informative and we both left with a much better understanding or the history of the Korean War I dont usually say this about museums but I definitely recommend this one and you should consider putting it on your mustdo list while visiting Seoul,35,probably
36,36,2313,After the nth battle where a small army of korean peasants defeated a foreign army composed of hundreds of thousands of cruel but well trained soldiers one starts to wonder if this is a history museum or just some fairy tales told to kids to make them like their country Seriously the whole museum is like that All countries do this but here is probably too blatant Youll learn something just not sure about what history or korean views of common stories,36,probably
37,37,2415,The Korea War Memorial is an enormous place with a large War Museum built around it  Pros 1 If you are at all interested in the Korean War or how it led to modern South Korea this is the ONE place you should visit There is a fascinating audiovisual exhibition on the Korean War just inside the main building on the left And simply put It will explain EVERYTHING you could possibly want to know about the Korean War Youll understand How it came to happen What happened And from first principles youll understand very clearly how this has led to the modern South Korea of today Furthermore by understanding the background youll understand very clearly the current context behind the NorthSouth Korean situation And possibly its future ramifications  2 There is a wonderful outdoor exhibition as well demonstrating US and ExUSSR and Chinese military hardware from the mid 1940s onwards If you can think of a tank missile helicopter aircraft antiaircraft gun its probably here This is probably the SINGLE and most COMPREHENSIVE collection of postworld war 2 hardware in Asia In my humble opinion the only place youre going to find better is probably the Smithsonian Washington DC USA or the Imperial War Museum London and Duxford Cambridgeshire England  3 If you are interested in middleages Korea the basement is quite interesting There is a lovely replica of a Turtle Ship Geobukseon in the basement Worth visiting  Cons 1 You need to walk a little bit to get to the museum It took me about 510 minutes to find it The nearest subway station is Samgakji or Namyeong Stations 2 The military hardware is outdoors It started raining when I visited Thus I suggest you bring an umbrella or appropriate waterproofoutdoor clothes if you intend to spend much time looking at the outdoors military collection  In summary The War Memorial of Korea is probably the BEST War Museum in the whole of Asia You will not find a larger or better collection of military hardware in Asia To find better youll have to go to Washington DC in the USA or Duxford Cambridgeshire England  I spent 3 hours at the Korean War Memorial And only saw 2530 of the exhibits on offer This place is VAST You could easily spend the whole day here  To conclude if you are a family And you have a boy in your group below the age of 21 Just GO TO THE WAR MEMORIAL of Korea Your son will have more fun that the REST of your trip to Korea put together,37,probably
38,38,2435,I can testify that in line with most other reviews on this this place is interesting and worth visiting It is probably built to remind the ordinary South Koreans of the need to defend themselves against the North  By reminding them of what happened in the past,38,probably
39,39,2454,Fantastic place Cant believe its free though we did give a donation Amazing place and something there for everyone When we visited in July they were in the process of building a separate museum for children in the grounds which will probably not be finished until 2015 but there is still loads of interest there for Adults and children alike from the different dynasty rooms with costumes a mini temple a childrens play area vintage cars and tanks planes and even a 3D theatre Hope to visit again in Oct when we go back to Seoul,39,probably
40,40,2665,Unless you were directly involved in the Korean War you probably dont know much about how and why it came about Even as a history buff and versed with the war itself I learned a lot here about the conditions that led to the war  the preWWII Japanese occupation the partitioning of Korea into the Soviet and US camps after the war and the factors that led to the North Korean invasion This is a huge place Not wanting to spend a whole day here I spent 2 hours in the three War rooms and felt I had gotten what I came her for There are many other displays inside and Korean War vintage aircraft to be seen outside Bottom line a very worthwhile visit for those who want and should have a better understanding of this time Even my wife who is not into museums of this type appreciated what she learned here and was glad she took the time for this,40,probably
41,41,2711,Now i know why this is ranked number 1 This memorial is more like a museum with massive ranges of history from all around the globe There are also amazing displays of weapons machinery and everything you can basically think of from rockets to battleships The outdoor part of the memorial is a football field sized area with tanks planes rockets and various artillery weapons This War Memorial would probably be number 1 in the world is amazing,41,probably
42,42,2742,Firstly there is no entrance fee so Id have gave a positive review even if it didnt live up to expectations But it really did and probably exceeded them given the size of the place and the quality of the exhibits Given Koreas war history over the last century there was so much to see many of which was quite sad to see but extremely interesting Dont miss the many memorials outside the museum itself as well as the area to the right of the museum with countless examples of war planes and tanks etc  plenty of photo opportunities,42,probably
43,43,2749,Gorgeous memorial Very well curated The War Memorial is a mustsee when youre in South KoreaIts seriously the biggest most awesome war museum Ive ever seen The giant reproduction of a turtle warship from the 1500s is probably their flagship piece but the extensive grounds full of tanks and planes and other engines of war vie for the top spot of most awesome thing to see there And thats not even taking into account the inside displays of all the canons and various firearms from I guess every military conflict ever to take place on the peninsula,43,probably
44,44,2752,I used to work at a museum I was a history major once I love war This place is completely awesome  Its seriously the biggest most awesome war museum Ive ever seen The giant reproduction of a turtle warship from the 1500s is probably their flagship piece but the extensive grounds full of tanks and planes and other engines of war vie for the top spot of most awesome thing to see there And thats not even taking into account the inside displays of all the canons and various firearms from I guess every military conflict ever to take place on the peninsula  Youd probably have to spend days to completely take in all they have to offer,44,probably
45,45,2920,This place is simply amazing and this is not because it is free admission From the look of the building it looks a bit like Capitol Hill or some advanced government building to the real life examples of various military equipment located in the lawn including real lifesized planes tanks and artiliary of both the US and Korean military one could spend at least one full day here if you care to look at all the exhibit both inside and outside One will definately be more appreciative of the deep military ties between US and South Korea and the Korean War We also saw school children visiting the place which is probably part of their school programme to learn more about the history of the country Definately worth the visit and you can take as many pictures as you want Note that the memorial is not located near any other mainstream tourist attractions and it is about a 5 minute walk from the subway station,45,probably
46,46,3026,This museum is huge so allow plenty of time to look around It is also highly interactive  a lot of displays have video or recreated scenes Kids will love it There is so much here that youll probably want to visit it over a couple of days with a few hours each day Highlights were the display of military hardware outside the museum which can be accessed even if the museum is closed and the section explaining the history and progress of the Korean War which was an eyeopener One tip  dont bother with the target shooting game it wasnt worth the wait,46,probably
47,47,3054,We went to the War memorial of Korea but found to our disappointment that it was closed because of fashion week This wasnt even announced on their website We were really excited to go there and the more the disappointment because of fashion week How could we know this since it wasnt on their website; what are they thinking The attaction itself is probably worth all 5 stars,47,probably
48,48,3079,Ill be the first to admit that Im probably not the one whos been to most museums but thats mostly because most museums Ive been at have failed to catch my true interest and attention When it first occurred to me Seoul had the War Memorial of Korea I thought to myself that it must at least be very informative when looking at Koreas huge history with war  And boy it didnt disappoint  Its easy to see its very influenced by USA lets ignore that and just appreciate the depth this museum has Not only is the museum huge it covers the older wars with their neighbors but also Vietnam it even had an exhibition about the Danish contribution to the Korean wars even though it wasnt a lot IN DANISH and whatever military struggle Koreas been in and theres a lot A lot of the displays are incredibly well made and most of it is in English so you dont have to be an expert in Hangul to appreciate it At the back of the museum theyve filled the yard with military vehicles tanks cannons helicopters and planes  Impressive museum And free,48,probably
49,49,3080,Really big need a few hours maybe 3 or 4 to really see the whole thing Loads of things to see inside as well as outside Gift shop and lockers I think free if you dont want to carry around your stuff Its a really nice memorial very moving and informative I have been here a few times and will probably go there again  Must do in Seoul Do it,49,probably
50,50,3115,Kinda creepy that they have a how to don a gas mask area for kids but probably necessary Great exhibits,50,probably
51,51,3144,It was a busy day when I visited but I would still probably bet I was the only person in the museum that had also visited the North Korean equivalent  The Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum in Pyongyang  It was interesting comparing the two and of course the Seoul version provides a much more rounded and historially accurate account However its possible to see propaganda from the South too  eg there are war crimes by the North documented here but the terrible atrocities committed by the South at the time are absent  Outside there are some large sculptures and quite an extensive display of military hardware from both sides as well as two of the massive loudspeaker systems used at the DMZ for psychological warfare until the operation was halted in 2004,51,probably
52,0,320,We visited this with a South Korean friend but missed the English tour  nevertheless its an absolute mustsee for you to understand the recent history and current climate of this land We would love to return and join the English tour but lots of the signs and videos are in English so Im guessing we probably didnt miss too much information Such a poignantly expressed display we were deeply moved and touched by the depth of emotion behind the presentations No spoilers just make it a point to go and spend a few hours there  well worth your time,52,guess
53,1,1119,Large and well worth visiting and provide substantial information on wars which have plagued Korea since the earliest recorded times It would be better named as a Museum than a Memorial I guess exhibits such as the Incheon Landing 4D ride are worthwhile for engaging teenagers but more emphasis should be on helping people to reflect what has caused war in the past and how to avoid future wars,53,guess
54,2,1150,It was ok but I have seen better memorials This one seemed lacking and was mediocre I guess it is worth seeing if you havent but dont have high expectations,54,guess
55,3,1275,Enjoyed this place tremendously The exhibits were very informative and gave me an idea of what it was like when Korea was at war Many pictures videos and relics  all of which provide new experiences of learning  The time you can spend here varies Personally I spent 4hrs here because Im the sort of person who reads and studies every single exhibit and stop to watch every show and video But there are some people who breeze and browse through quite quickly and could possibly finish everything in about an hour I guess it depends on what interests you  There was a 4D show in one of the exhibits on the 2nd level that illustrated the operations of the Incheon Landing That was rather impressive I thought By 4D I mean that you will be secured to your seat because the motion chairs move according to whether youre on a boat or a plane  Another thing that was really impressive was how you could use your smartphone to read more about the exhibits  either by NFC or QR scanning Beside the exhibits there would be a little panel for you to scan which would automatically open a page on your phone The page contained information about what you are seeing and would sometimes lead you to YouTube videos to illustrate it What a great way to learn  One of the must visit places if youre in to history,55,guess
56,4,2177,Came to this memorial as part of a tour as we only stopped briefly here I didnt really get to check out the different monuments carefully and get to really understand the history and meaning behind it I guess it would be a really interesting stop to visit if someones interested in history and eager to learn more about the Korean war,56,guess
57,5,2398,Ive been to this museum 5 times over 15 years It is not that good If you are an English speaker and Im guessing you are because you are on this website the translations are not good enough to keep your interest This place was great 15 years ago before the National Museum of Korea was built Now its a second rate military history museum,57,guess
58,6,2676,This place has some really good exhibits and is really well designed I guess its the first stop for most people doing the DMZ tour as it gives and intro and an insight into the war,58,guess
59,7,2749,Gorgeous memorial Very well curated The War Memorial is a mustsee when youre in South KoreaIts seriously the biggest most awesome war museum Ive ever seen The giant reproduction of a turtle warship from the 1500s is probably their flagship piece but the extensive grounds full of tanks and planes and other engines of war vie for the top spot of most awesome thing to see there And thats not even taking into account the inside displays of all the canons and various firearms from I guess every military conflict ever to take place on the peninsula,59,guess
60,8,2752,I used to work at a museum I was a history major once I love war This place is completely awesome  Its seriously the biggest most awesome war museum Ive ever seen The giant reproduction of a turtle warship from the 1500s is probably their flagship piece but the extensive grounds full of tanks and planes and other engines of war vie for the top spot of most awesome thing to see there And thats not even taking into account the inside displays of all the canons and various firearms from I guess every military conflict ever to take place on the peninsula  Youd probably have to spend days to completely take in all they have to offer,60,guess
61,9,2884,So off the bat the outdoor display of military hardware is most impressive and would Wow any little boys or grown men who are into that stuff We spent a little while perusing the tanks planes missiles etc Then we moved inside Huge building The huge open space in front of the building devoid of any greenery reminds me of the grounds of the palaces we had visited the previous days I think Koreans just seem to love that grand sweeping open space to show case the main act  the building itself Hence no trees shrubberies or flowers in the immediate front of the building to distract ones eyes The museum have exhibits of Korean military history that goes back very far  like to 900 AD or maybe even further back As far as they have records of I guess Of course back that far it wasnt Korea as we know it today The land mass that is modern day N  S Korea hosted various kingdoms and fiefdoms whose borders fluctuated and changed many times You also get the sense that the official narrative wants to put a very proud and positive spin on Korean military achievement As with the various other museums we went into prior to this one the Koreans are not so great with putting any of the accompanying texts displayed in English Which is frustrating and perplexing since one would think that they would jump at the chance to educate visitors on their rich history  culture Instead one is left feeling very blah about whatever potentially interesting things we might be viewing since we have no idea what it is or its significance The English when there is any would be like 2 sentences long and then the Korean part would be whole paragraphs long  erm I think theyre saying way more than the English translation here Surely they can hire someone who can translate this stuff Anyway this might have been 5 stars if it wasnt for the lack of English in the exhibits Same goes for all the museums in Seoul that we went to,61,guess
62,10,3068,The sanctuary of National Defense or the war memorial of Korea is located in the heart of the city We reached the by a subway This museum contains various records of the war and soldiers including remains of their forefathers who devoted their lives for their country  The war museum consists of 6 indoor exhibition rooms the memorial hall the war history room the Korean was room the expeditionary forces room the ROK armed forces room the large  defense equipment room and an outdoor exhibition area of military equipment  Honestly I got bored after a while though dont get me wrong the items are well kept and an audio guide is available for better understanding of the exhibit rental fee is 2000 won or approx 2 I guess too much information and seeing a lot of war items can be overwhelming but it is worth a visit  admission is free closed on mondays 09001800,62,guess
63,11,3110,This is far from the 1 place in Seoul that some people say visit the National Museum of Korea well before this in other words I was in Seoul for two weeks and only got there on my last day and edited the time down to one hour The encyclopaedic coverage on level 3 of every conflict that the ROK has been involved in means it was rather militaristic from my point of view  explains why so many armed forces personnel were on visits there I guess Level 2 which deals with the Korean war is obviously the most important as earlier Korean military history receives similar but not as detailed coverage in other Korean museums Given the 60 year stand off with the North and the virtual on alert status since then of the armed forces you can begin to understand how ingrained in the Korean mind potentialif not perhaps imminent conflict is,63,guess
