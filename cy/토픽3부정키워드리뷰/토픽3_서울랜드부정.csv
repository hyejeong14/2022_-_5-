1,1,24,"The place is so deserted and empty when we went on a weekday. Perhaps the rides are more suitable for younger children (5-12 years old) or its not as popular as the other 2 theme parks. Or maybe some of the rides are abit run down.  There are probably only less than 80 people during our visit and my kids can repeat the same ride 6 times without ridiculous queue. Mostly younger kids like 12-15 years old and lesser couples. They have a huge rollercoaster and drop down just like the popular theme park. Price is half compared to Lotte World when you purchase through KLOOK app. Super worth it and you need walk 3 mins after exit from train station to take the elephant ride to the theme park. Or walk to park in 15 mins.  There are restaurants, 7-11, cafes and 1 halal Kebab stall (near Tomorrow Land). For muslims, there is a dedicated musollah near 7-11, please ask the staff to open the door for you. Very clean and spacious with separate rooms, however we can't use the tap so its handy to bring a bottle of clean water.",1,probably
2,0,51,"I went to Seoul Land with my family. I think there's the amusement park part and the zoo part. We went to the zoo part. Actually we were planning to go to the amusement park but we went there by accident. Anyways, it didn't cost that much. There were many animals. It wasn't bad... I guess we had a good time.But I think I would go to the amusement park next time if I have a chance.",2,guess
3,1,52,"we took our 5 nieces and nephews here on Oct. 28 and the place was OK, I guess. As an American that has visited Disney Resort and Six Flags, this place is of much lower quality. The rides are very dated for an amusement park. There is one roller coaster that is Six Flags Quality and the rest of the place seems to be stuck in the 70's. For western visitors, I would say this would be a giant letdown. The food available is OK, but unless you have lived in Korea for a bit(i did for two years) and developed a taste for the local food, you may have trouble finding anything other than fried chicken. My advice for Westerners, take the kids to a temple or historic site where they can learn something about another culture. If you live in Korea, sorry this is what you have to put up with for an amusement park.",3,guess

5,1,46,"We are a military family with a 9yr old and a 3yr old. First tip - take the subway.....if you don't read anything else in this review, remember this....take the subway. It's easy, inexpensive, drops you off right at the Seoul Grand Park entrance, and you do not deal with any traffic at all. So, we took the subway, exited the station and walked about 1/2 mile to the tram station. 2,700 won later, we boarded the tram and the 2nd stop is Seoul Land (1st stop is the zoo). The tram ride is one way, it will cost you another 2,700 won to take it back. TIp #2 - pay the won and take the tram or 1/2 your day will be walking to and from the entrance. I have no idea why, and the website said we would have to pay close to 120,000 won, but they charged us 45,000 and we could ride all of the rides until the park closed. The park is dated, but for $40 for the entire family, how can you beat it? There are 3 big roller coasters, a bungey jump, Free Fall (for anyone who has ever been to a 6 flags), and a few other rides intense enough to make you want to throw your breakfast up. Tip #3 - This is very important.....If you littlest one is over 100cm, I would seriously pass on this amusement park. Our littlest one is 101cm and they measured him off prior to every single ride. Thank God he busted 100cm or else it would have been a very long, disappointing trip. We went expecting Seoul Land, not Disney, and not Busch Gardens. If you go there wanting to have a really cool afternoon with your kids, there is more than enough rides for every age group. No, it's not huge. No it's not Busch Gardens. Yes, we had a great day with our kids, spent about 7 hours at the park, with absolutely no lines, no hassle, and a very friendly staff willing to go out of their way to make it a special day. Tip #4 - If you are a Westerner, you may want to stick to the burger restaurants, but there is fried chicken, and a Turkish booth selling Kebabs and Gyros. With the subway, the tickets, the tram, lunch, snacks, drinks, and even a few toys, we paid around 100,000 total for our family of 4, no kidding. Last and final tip - Go!",5,would
6,2,48,"Just went there today with my 2 children aged 10 and 8. It's a pretty interesting park with an amusement park in one section, the zoo in another. Had already read the comments on the zoo and no one mentioned that entrance into the zoo required cash or a korean card. I wanted to buy a package that included the sky lift (which was awesome!) and tram and zoo entrance with my canadian credit card and they said that the zoo entrance fee could not be paid by my credit card. The tram and skylift were separate and went through ok. There was one ATM machine but it does not work with north american cards. Zoo was ok. Yes the enclosures seemed small compared to our zoos. I can't comment on the animals. We have a world renowned zoo at home and they were all doing the same thing...sleeping. We enjoyed our trip and would come back and join all the active seniors just to do the hike up the mountain! Unlike many public places in north america, the washrooms are super clean as are all the subways!",6,would

10,1,54,"Disclaimer: I have not been to Everland or Lotte World. However, as parks go, this was a great experience. First, mind the audience, which is for young people or families. Second, it is inexpensive. Third, it is an older park. Finally, the rides are more intense than their equivalent in the USA.  We went on a Tuesday when it was cool and school is in. There were a number of young kids there on school trips and they were the only ""crowd"" to be had. It was very sparsely populated. The temperatures and short lines were great.  We only paid 28,000 won for two people all day & all rides, though it was shown to be 32,000 per person for that ticket. That was a super deal and we got it at the counter. I don't know why. Additionally, the park food is very reasonably priced, just a smidge above street fair price.  The park was built prior to the Olympics in Seoul and most of the rides are meant for younger people; however, they are more intense than their equivalent in the states. The flying carpet, pirate ship, ""frontal spinning ride"", two roller coasters, etc., are all worth it. If you go on a cool day when most the crowds will be minimal, you will have a blast!",10,number
