14,10,285,"We went with our 20month old toddler and really enjoyed the whole day there. It's a huge park with outdoor and indoor playground. Probably because we went on a weekday, the whole park was very quiet. Entrance to the main park is free, but certain attractions charge a fee. Key highlights 1) best thing about this place is the Seoul Children's Museum. There's an entrance fee but it's not expensive. They also allow u to exit and re-enter on the same day. There are 4 storeys catering to different children age groups and the set up on each floor is very impressive, especially the water play on level 3! I think it's fun for all kids from toddlers to teens. 2) catch the animal show called Anistory featuring many types of animals including seals, birds, cats, monkey etc. Need to pay for entry though. It's quite entertaining. Even though we didn't understand the language, we still enjoyed it very much. 3) the park is massive, great if u like outdoor walks. There's a huge water fountain show near the Seoul Children's Museum that's quite impressive too.  Overall a nice destination that offers both indoor and outdoor experiences. I didn't like the mini zoo though. Each enclosure was very small and the animals looked a bit depressed. I wouldn't recommend if your only objective is to visit the zoo.",14,much
15,11,286,"This place is a hidden gem and not many tourists visit this park. Very nice, clean and spacious park with lots to see like gardens, playground & mini-zoo. Kids would definitely love this place. The mini-zoo is a little sad as it's under-maintained and some animals look sad in their enclosures.  Plus point: Nice, clean and spacious park. Free entry except for the amusement park section. Not crowded!  Negative: Somewhat under-maintained. Has the potential to be much better",15,much
16,12,288,"Information found online about the Children’s Grand Park can sometimes be sketchy and inconsistent.  I hope that the following will provide a better picture for those planning to visit the park. I have also attached a picture of the park map that I will refer to below.  The park can be accessible by 2 subway stations.  The main gate (#1 on map) is accessible easily by the Children's Grand Park Station on Line 7.  There is a rear gate (#36 on map) that is accessible by the Achasan Station on Line 5.  The park has no entrance fee, except for the amusement park section.  My suggestion is that children below 14 yrs will appreciate the park.  I brought a tween son, and 2 pre-school kids to the park.  All three enjoyed the amusement park (#38 on map), which is closer to the rear gate. The amusement park had rides catering to pre-school kids to tweens. Do note there are some rides that have a 120cm height requirement. Rides such as the Viking, Dropzone and Roller coaster are generally adapted for tweens. For those a little younger, there are bumper cars and spinning saucers that are children friendly. However, this place would not be recommended for toddlers. A cafeteria is found within the amusement park serving traditional Korean foods and burgers. Nothing to shout about but it satisfies the tummy.  Amusement park entrance fees depends on the type of ticket you purchase. Tickets are available in single ride, 5 rides, 10 rides and unlimited rides options.  For the 5 ride option, kids paid 16,000 won. Adults paid 19,000 for the same ticket.  Toddlers and pre-school kids should check out the playground (#12 on map) with wet play and dry obstacle options. Bring your toys for sand play if you wish.  The other attraction we tried was the zoo – a mini zoo at that. We saw an elephant, snakes, birds and baboons. A couple of macaws looked like they were suffering from a disease that caused balding on their body. The kids enjoyed the zoo but soon lost interest in it once they stepped out of the zoo.  Next to the zoo is a pavilion which sells snacks (#34 on map) like ice-cream, corn dogs and cold drinks – a great respite from the heat.  2 attractions that we did not visit – the children’s museum (#46 on map) and Kid’s Auto Park (#44 on map) would probably suit school going kids.  Directions:  For the museum, and auto park, use the main gate.  For the amusement park, use the rear gate.  The zoo is in the middle of the park and are equidistant from either gates.  In summary, this park is accessible by 2 subway lines. It provides a place for kids to be themselves and preserves the sanity of parents who want kids to run wild and not bother them for too much over a couple of hours. School going children will probably benefit the most out of a half day excursion to this park.",16,much
17,13,307,"This is the BEST, MOST AWESOME, CLEANEST, WELL-MAINTAIINED, museum for kids. My toddler 23months wnjoyed the toddlers area - crawling, climbing, sliding, and pretend house play. My 12 and 7 years old enjoyed the water play area, construction area, the wheel chair experience, digital art, and so much more. We stayed 10am to 4pm, and they still can't get enough. It was really a fun fun day.",17,much
18,14,316,"The children's museum was such an amazing place for kids. One could easily spend the whole day at the museum and the park. Be prepared to spend more than 3 hours here if you bring your kids to the museum because there's just so much activities for them to do. Ticket were very reasonably priced, which is a huge bonus point!",18,much
19,15,329,"The place is big... if you have young children, walking from one end to another is a challenge.  2-3 playgrounds. One decent sized amusement park with a range of rides.  The children's museum is not expensive but is packed with 4 floors of displays and activities. It is similar to the children's museum in Ottawa. There is enough English signage on the displays.  We went in march so weather was still chilly and the foliage was bare. It would be so much better in spring/summer months!!",19,much
20,16,331,"My 4 year old boy loved it, did not want to leave, and says he wants to fly 8 hours to go back there. Tomorrow.  So the rating I gave here refers purely to the Museum, and not to the park.  This Museum is a very interactive museum designed for young children, probably best for those between 4-7. Spread over 4 floors, to the kids, it will be 99% play and 1% learning. There are explanations in English as well as Korean, but I doubt if the kids are going to read these. Straight to the fun.  We had originally allocated one day to cover both the Children's Grand Park and the Seoul Children's Museum, which share a compound. During winter, half a day in the Park (free admission; pay for specific rides) is sufficient. But as mentioned earlier, half a day for the Museum -- at least to my kid -- was not enough.  To note, there is a small café on the ground floor near the entrance. But to really have a meal, the little mall across the road is probably more suitable.  There is an admission charge to enter this Museum.  For parents and older kids, there isn't much (else) to do.  One last point: this Museum can be accessed from the ""Children's Grand Park"" subway station.",20,much
21,17,339,"The entire park is a good place for kids to roam. There are at least two playgrounds where kids can use the facilities. We paid 500won for free play of traditional Korean games and also arcade games at the stage area (just near the entrance).  For the museum, it will be worthwhile to go in earlier so that your kids can have more time to explore all the stations. The driving centre was closed when we went there at about 3 pm on a Saturday.  There is a lack of restaurants around so it will be good to pre pack some food in case your kids are hungry. The only food place we can get is the small cafeteria at the museum.  Most of the zoo enclosures were closed or empty (probably due to winter and the bird flu season) so do not expect to see much from the zoo.",21,much
22,18,343,My child is six and wanted to spend most of his time at the amusement rides. However he was deemed too short to ride most even with an adult - and even the dodgems which was a surprise. So the rides were limited. We also tried to go to a part of the park where kids can drive little cars but it was all shut up and didn't look to be used much. We didn't get to the zoo part.,22,much
23,19,348,"We are foreigners living in Seoul and loved this gem. It's very easy to get to from line 4 on the subway. We came here to go to the zoo but we found much more here. There is a great place for small kids to play indoors but that can be pricey. I would avoid coming here on Jr sunny days though, the walking can be brutal.",23,much
24,20,363,Went there with a friend and had so much fun! It reminded me of my childhood and made me feel like a child again. This park is so big that even though i spend there whole day i still could see much more on my next visit.,24,much
25,21,367,"Best things about this park are that it's close to the city centre and so very easy to get to by the metro, and it's FREE!!!  We took line 5 on the metro which takes you to the back gate of the park, but it's still an impressive entrance gate. There were fountains by the entrance, and then more in the middle of the park which are what my daughter loved most (and she got drenched, so a change of clothing may have been a good idea). There are also several play areas, most of which are sandy, so appropriate beach-type footwear would have been better than the shoes she went in, but we'll know for next time  She didn't really like the zoo area much, and the animal enclosures did look quite small which I often think is quite sad for the animals, so I was quite glad she didn't want to spend too long in that part.  We went on a Friday afternoon and the park was quite busy with groups of school children. There were also quite a number of people who had taken picnics, and pop-up tents to shield themselves from the very bright sun (we weren't very well prepared as I thought it was going to be a cloudy day and hadn't expected it to be so hot).  We only went into 1 toilet block and ended up using the disabled toilet which had the type of toilet in that we're more used to - the toilets in the ladies were ""squat"" style, which I don't like and I knew would it would be disastrous to try to get my 5-year old to use one of them!!!!",25,much
26,22,378,"It's a park with zoo, botanical garden, amusement park, etc. I went to take a walk there and looked around. There are a lot of families with young children there. You can also see teens taking thrill rides at the amusement park. The admission is free but you have to pay to enjoy the rides. Overall, it was really nothing much.",26,much
27,23,381,"Not a touristy place per se, but for family with young children, I highly recommend to visit.  The park is huge, really nice place to stroll around. They have lots of attractions but due to weather in winter, some are closed.  Particularly love the children's museum. One of the best museum i've been too and my boy enjoyed it so much. Very interactive and worry not, everything come with english translation.  Thing to note: bring your own lunch/food. The cafe sells ice cream n coffee only. Unless you want to walk further out near the zoo, there is an american style restaurant selling burger and pasta.",27,much
28,24,382,"Location is wonderful which is just a few minutes walks from subway. Amazingly, it is free of charge, large park, not much animals but definitely is good for kids to learn between different species. My family (with 2 little kids) spent half day over there and we liked it much.",28,much
29,25,393,"Doing too much touristy things for the adults in Seoul? Give your kids at least half a day here in the big outdoor playground, sand/dirt area, free zoo including camel and donkey rides, musical water fountain, etc.. You will find Korean families camping out with tents and picnic baskets. When it's windy, the dirt/sand does get picked up, so it is best to put a net on the stroller. Not advisable, however, to go on Children's Day, a National holiday in the beginning of May.",29,much
30,26,402,"It was very hot outside but our children wanted to have fun anyway. Plus! It was summer vocation time in Korea. So every attraction sight was crowded with millions of people. So this park was good, not too many people, they went into special fountain which was very fun and cool x. They had a nice zoo but the park is going to be much more exiting in 2014, when the restoration will be over.",30,much
31,27,410,"I have been to Everland and I paid so much for a family of 5 to play on the skip slope for my children. Its very rush to wake up in the morning and the tour bus will pick you up from the hotel and it takes about 1hr and 30mins to reach there and by 3pm they want you back on the bus to bring you to some other places to buy some ginseng. **Go to this place call the Children's Grand Park but it's actually the Zoo. There they have verything that Everland have and you can take your own sweet time going there by train on the Dark green line and stop at station 726. You will enjoyed and never regret going. Take the open air ""cable car"" up to the mountains. It's beautiful and many many more.  Jimmy Ng",31,much
32,28,418,"We visited this park in Seoul because it was free and we wanted to see the music fountain! To see the lit up fountain with sound effects was cool but there was so much more..people go there to do some dance as a group done by community workers i guess , my daughter joined in and had a great time. The zoo was a bit old but still enjoyable..there is some rides for kids as well!",32,much
33,29,419,"The Children's Grand park is grand! It is free to get in. There are tons of different themed areas, and the entire place is covered in huge trees, so it's a beautiful place just to walk through. There's an adventure land with lots of play structures, a zoo, botanical garden, pony, donkey and camel rides, an amusement park, a marine animal exhibit, an animal show, and many more. We ate at the botanical garden cafeteria. My son and I had pasta carbonara for 6000 won each and it was delicious. My husband had a burger which was actually two smaller patties side by side, I believe his was about 7000 won for the burger, fries and drink, he said it was good, but he was not as ecstatic over his meal as I was about mine. I was just happy that they had pasta which is one of the few things my 3 year old will eat. There were many family mart vendors around so finding a drink when you needed one was easy. The restrooms were very clean and always nearby. We went to the amusement park and opted for single ride tickets, 3000 won for each ride for our son, and 4000 won for each ride for us, we only rode a few rides. My husband and I took turns on the roller coaster which was really fun. And our son rode the kiddie truck ride and the carousel. You can also buy a combo ticket for 5 rides, I believe it was 12000 won for children and 15000 for adults. Or you could buy a ride all day bracelet which I believe was 20000 and 25000 for children and adults, but those prices may not be exact. Our most favorite part of the park was the polar bears in the marine exhibit, they swim right up to the glass and being that close to such a huge animal is amazing. Also, we really enjoyed the camel ride. I rode with our 3 year old son and it was 8000 for the two of us. Our son rode a donkey by himself for 3000 won, and a gentleman led the donkey around and held onto our son to be sure he stayed on. We also went to the animal show called Anistory. It is a cross between an animal show and the cinderella story. It was 8000 for each my husband and I, and our son was free. So it cost us 16000 won to see, and although it was entertaining I didn't feel that the show was worth that much. If you go to the Seoul Zoo you should see the dolphin show, very entertaining and only 2000 won per person. We only saw one souvenir shop but didn't find anything we wanted to buy. But altogether the experience was a fun one, and I would recommend it to anyone, even those without children :)",33,much
34,0,15, A wonderful park and zoo there is nothing to compare with yet Were here for the second time and a lot of impressions not only for children ,34,nothing
35,1,334,"While this park is okay (nothing too special) the zoo area is totally depressing. It can be really hard to see the animals penned in such small enclosures. In Seoul, there are dozens of other parks and even a better zoo. I would really advise travelers to not go to this place. If you want amusement rides, you can find several other amusement parks in and around Seoul to visit that don't have such a sad portion to their park.",35,nothing
36,2,355,"The place was huge. We didn't get through it all in the 4 hours we were there. The play areas we got to were nice. I wouldn't really advise the zoo though. We only made it to the monkey's and ""ferocious animal village"". Enclosures were small. Most animals did not have toys or things for their entertainment. The female lion was the only one and she looked so depressed. The elephant had nothing to play with and was alone. It just rocked back and fourth. The red foxes looked mangey and malnourished. A+ for the playgrounds. F for the ""zoo"". Free or not, no animal should be kept like that.",36,nothing
37,3,375,One of my favourite hangout in Seoul because it's free and I am a kid at heart. There is a mini zoo that features many more animals that you would expect from a park. I usually visit with my friends when we just want to hangout but don't want to sit around and do nothing.  Not advised to visit on weekends cause it will be super crowded. Weekdays afternoons are the best.,37,nothing
