2,2,237,"This is a park in massive area which includes multiple different attractions. The zoo has most visitors and is a pretty good place to any ages.  Facilities: Zoo, Garden, Camping Zone, Seoul Land(Amusement Park), Contemporary Museum, etc. We only entered the zoo. But, there was a rose garden as a season special and it looked nice, too.  Location: This is in Gwacheon City. But, only 4 stops away from Metro Sadang Station (line #4). Accessibility is great from Seoul. From the metro station, it's a short walk to the park. There are some food stalls in the way. It's fun to watch and I recommend having foods here because foods inside the park are much more expensive.  Zoo: - We bought combined ticket of 10,500 won for a lift, a elephant bus and an entrance. After buying the ticket, go to the lift station on the right and take the lift until the highest area of the zoo. Walk around the zoo and take the bus when it's done. This seems to be the best way to save money.  - The zoo was fine. Food stands, bathrooms, benches are everywhere. Bird Zone is like a Jurassic Park. If you are lucky, you'll be able to see parrots very closely. We were very amused to see apes. I think Ape Zone is the best part in this zoo.  - I was a bit disappointed not to see lions. There were MANY constructions and some animals aren't staying at where they are supposed to be. Bat cages were empty.  - It's a lot of walking anyway. Be ready to get tired.  - There's A-Zoo tour on the website to travel comfortably riding on a cart for children or seniors. It's not available at the ticket office. I think they should fix that.  - Even though there are animals of many kinds, there are still many this zoo doesn't have. So, don't expect to see every one you can imagine.  - There's an arboretum in the zoo. It was just okay level.  - There are a number of visitors in the zoo. But, this is a huge zoo and there's no chance to wait to see something. We liked it.  - Some of them close at 18:00. You'd better enter before that if you wish to see everything.",2,everything
3,3,269,"Very nice and big zoo, we were there for 5 hours and did not get to see everything. Even though it was quite busy on a Sunday, the park is big enough to not feel trapped in the masses. Some very nice pavilions (especially the tiger part), but also unfortunately some very small cages for certain animals. End of March is still a bit cold and some animals were thus still kept inside (which is good for them, no complaints on that as an animal lover), and the grass and flowers still have to set in. I certainly recommend the place, it's a must visit, but would advice to go mid April or later. Also very cheap (3000 WON for an adult)",3,everything
4,4,281,"I visited the Gwacheon-located Seoul Grand Park and it was overall a positive experience. I only visited the zoo section, and not Seoul Land, the amusement park. For what it's worth my friends have told me that Seoul Land isn't really worth it, compared to Lotte World or Everland. The zoo features many animals, of all kinds and species and from all continents. There's pretty much everything you can think of : reptiles, big mammals, seals, éléphants, lions... The park is also perfectly located in between mountains and offers a stunning view. It also has a fairly large choice of dining and snack options. My bigger complaint with the park is that it feels a bit run down. Enclosures are fairly stale, and a some animals seemed a bit unhealthy. It also lacks some kind of a theme (safari, themes for different clades or cintinents), special events allowing greater interaction with animals or staff, as well as a session dedicated to children for example)",4,everything
5,5,290,"I've read a couple other reviews here and I share generally the same sentiment. The zoo itself is incredible, there are tons of animals from all over the world to see. The rose gardens are amazing as well. I took a gondola ride that goes over everything and provides you with amazing views. I am however slightly concerned for the animals. You can literally put your hands about 3 feet from the cages and feed the animals food. I saw people giving the Gibbons cheetos. It was sort of funny, but I felt guilty watching it. Different country, different views on how a zoo should be run, but overall I had a great time.",5,everything

9,3,294,"This place was amazing and so big we couldn't even do it all before we got tired and a little too hot for the day. There are many animals and they have nicely done enclosures. The guide map was in English but we found very few of the staff spoke English. However this wasn't too important as we wanted to just see the animals. They had an amazing dolphin and seal lion show that was included with the entrance fee. There was an impressive green house with many many different species of lovely plants. We also took the sky lift to get a birds eye view (and return to the front) and it wasn't very expensive. The zoo is non-smoking which was nice. There were several food options and one had a lot of good Korean food options with a serve yourself kimchi bar. There were colored lines along paths if you wanted to do a particular loop with each taking about two hours to complete. We didn't use these, but it was a nice option. Overall this zoo was enormous and very nicely done. We were glad we were able to visit and little sad we didn't get to see the whole place (or have time to to return again on another day).",9,staff
10,4,306,"We are a family of four, we have a 9 year old daughter and a 3 year old son. We went to Seoul Grand Park on Sep 1 2013 and loved it. I would highly recommend taking the subway, line #4, stop SEOUL GRAND PARK. If you exit out of exit 2, you will walk about 1/4 mile to the SGP tram loading/unloading zone. I would recommend paying to ride the tram as the entrance to the zoo is about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile uphill (and trust me you are going to be walking uphill enough). The tram cost us 2,700 won. Although the tram area looks busy as all get out, trams came one right after another, only waiting about 30 seconds between trams. They moved us out like cattle! We were pleased with the tram. So, once the tram stopped, we bought our tickets to the zoo (they included a special ""theme"" ticket allowing us into another attraction, I am all but certain it was the rose garden, but we never made it), and we entered the zoo (9,600 won total, I could NOT believe how inexpensive it was). Ok, once in the zoo, either take the ski lift all the way up to the top and walk down and call it a day, or find a good spot to tighten your walking shoes. The walk to the top is uphill, you will earn your view of the lions and the other ""cats"", but it is well worth it. I've never been to a zoo that had over 6 lions, not lioness, lions! This zoo has it ALL, from Bison, Bears (so many), Dolphins to Deer. The highlight of the day was the deer eating out of my daughter and son's hand (although it's probably not recommended by the staff, if you have little ones than bring lettuce or carrots, my kids just fed them the green leaves they found on the ground and they ate them). We had absolutely no complaints about this zoo, in fact it blew away our expectations. Bathrooms extremely clean, convenient stores selling soda and snacks for regular prices (not jacked up because it's in a zoo, a soda was 900 won), and such a wide variety of animals. Tip #1 - allow a FULL day here. So, the end of the day we hopped back on the tram and we thought it would take us straight to the loading/unloading area we boarded the tram when we arrived....no. It made one stop at Seoul Land prior to heading back. Tip #2 - there is MORE at the Seoul Grand Park than the zoo!!! Who knew right?? Well, we do and we are definitely heading back soon! We had an incredible day!",10,staff

12,1,245,"My kid loves animals so it was her 1st time in Seoul so I thought lets go and visit the Zoo, The entrance to the zoo is very far so once you get off from the Metro you arrive at 1 entrance from there you can buy a ticket on the elephant train and then get off at the zoo entrance. Once you get of the elephant train, you have to pay again to get back on it lol  The actual zoo is very large but due to winter most of the animals are kept inside, you can still see them but it would be better if you visit the Zoo after spring. The paths are slippery with ice so be careful.  Next to the zoo is Seoul Land an amusement park, it was too cold to go there so didnt bother.",12,didnt

17,2,243,"Primarily came for the zoo. It's a bit overwhelming in term of the size. The place is so huge and be prepared to do a lot of walking.  In term of animals, a bit disappointed. The only marine I saw was sea lion. No more dolphin. Didn't get to see many animals.  The only nice thing I like is the sky lift. If you visit must try sky lift.",17,disappointed
18,3,251,"We went together with 2 other families and there are a total of 6 children (aged 2 to 8) and 6 adults. We only manage to go to the zoo though we bought the package price.  Generally, I am pleased to go there as my girl (aged 8) is the only child who is interested in seeing those animals (except that she is disappointed that she did not get to see dolphin there as the dolphins have gone back to nature.)  My younger daughter aged 6 did not enjoy seeing the animals as much as like the playground there ( similar as the rest of the other kids)  Good to allow the children to explore and see the real animals out there.",18,disappointed
19,4,289,"Perhaps I am just spoiled having recently visited a few zoological facilities in the United States and being from Columbus, Ohio where noted animal expert, Jack Hannah was the Zoo Director for many years and remains Director Emeritus. The things that I really liked about the Seoul Grand Park Zoo is it's ease of access. It is very easy to find and very easy to get to. That says a lot for a Korean city like Gwacheon, which is part of metropolitan Seoul. The grounds of Seoul Grand Park are expansive. It is a great place just to go and hike and you can see many locals who go there to do just that. The walk-ways double as access roads for shuttle busses and service vehicles, so they are very wide. The park is full of beautiful sprawling hardwoods and little island of green grass where you can sit and relax. Many have Korean-style wooden decks that are covered with aesthetic local-flavored covering and there are some places that are African themed with covered pavilions suitable for groups to relax. Seoul Grand Park is not ALL Zoo, but it has many different parts to it. At the parking lot you can find wide walking avenues lined with trees leading to the entrance to the general park. There are adequate western-style restroom facilities throughout the park. You have the option of taking a lift into the park or taking the ""Elephant Train"" which is just a Tow vehicle pulling several passenger platforms. Hold on to your children though--the driver only has two speeds, stop and escape velocity. The Elephant Train costs about 600 won each time you use it and it only takes you to the entrance of the Zoo and the other parks. I think there were three or four stops in all. Once at the entrance of the Zoo, the admission for adults is 3,000 won. They will only give you one ticket for your entire party and it will have the number of people on the ticket, so don't get separated before you go through the Zoo entrance. All that being said, once inside the zoo I was really disappointed at the obvious wear on the infrastructure. Everywhere you looked facilities cried out for a coat of paint and rust treatment. We came upon so many of the different ""herd"" animals and they were in vast outdoor enclosures. That's great for the animals I think, but they were so far away most of the time that you couldn't really observe them. Fortunately the park is loaded with casted replicas of the animals. It presents a lot of photo opportunities for the kids I guess. One of the things we really wanted to see was the Dolphin Show advertised on the English Web Page for the Seoul Grand Park Zoo. When we finally found the Marine Pavilion, the ticket windows had shutters pulled down inside. There were no signs showing the performance schedule or the admission price for the Dolphin show and we couldn't fined anyone around to ask. There were several marine habitats built around the perimeter of the Marine Pavilion, but they were not well kept. The water was dirty with a dark green tint and the walls of the habitat had not been repainted in years and there was a lot of places where paint had either worn away over years of neglect or chipped off the surface. I wouldn't be surprised if the Marine mammals had died over the years because of the poor conditions. After all, there was only one or two of each of the varieties of sea lions per habitat and they didn't seem too healthy. They rarely came out of the water and because it was so dirty it was nearly impossible to see them. I later asked an information attendant about the Dolphin show and she told me they hadn't had a Dolphin show in over two years despite being advertised on the English Web Page. From the looks of the outside of the Marine Pavilion I'd bet they are hoping to eliminate the marine exhibits by attrition as the animals die off. No I can't verify that, but the generally lacking upkeep of the Marine Pavilion and surrounding marine habitats, the lack of performances, and failure to care for the animals by just cleaning the scum out of the habitats or changing the water is highly suspect. I will give high marks to the Mountain Goat exhibit area. They have a manufactured rock cliff mountain that is really high and there was a huge herd of goats spread out on practically every available ledge and plateau and they were actively climbing up and down, passing each other on narrow pathways of rock--all looking quite natural. It was awesome to see how sure-footed they were and I felt this exhibit really captured the essence of the animals. The Giraffe habitat was also well done. There were three out in the open when I was there and they have a second-story platform where you can look at the eye-to-eye if they ever come that close. I really enjoyed the Meerkats too. There were only three in the exhibit, but it looked somewhat small. The interesting thing is that the pen was relatively small and they were only separated from patrons by a short Plexiglas wall. It would be easy for unsupervised children to feed them junk. I did notice that one child was eating something while I was there and one of the little Meerkats scurried over beside him and stood up just inside the Plexiglas waiting to see if there was anything edible coming his way. But it was fun to be able to see these little guys up close. They are adorable! The brochure that you get when you enter the Zoo says there are shuttle busses running around the park that will take you between venues or to the exit, but we were at all of the venues listed as stops in the brochure and we never saw a bus run. When I asked the information attendant as I was leaving she said the busses were running earlier in the day, but we were there for about 4 hours and never saw the bus once. If you want to go get some good exercise and be bathed by the sprawling hardwoods as you hike the hills throughout the Zoo and surrounding hills, this is a great place to go. After all, it costs only 3,000 won to enter. Perhaps that is the difference between the cleanliness and better upkeep in the Zoos I have visited in the United States--all of them have a much higher entrance fee. You'd pay $3 dollars or more for just a bottle of water in a US Zoo too, but here at Seoul Grand Park bottled water is only 1,000 won and they have free water fountains, food and souvenir/toy shops throughout the park. They have stroller rentals available as you enter the Zoo and there are also some coin-operated lockers available and I think they cost 500 won.",19,disappointed
