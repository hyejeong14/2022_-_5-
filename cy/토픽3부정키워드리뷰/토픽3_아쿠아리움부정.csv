0,0,87, I went together with the Lotte Tower Observation Deck but I didnt go to an aquarium here and there so it was just that I think a house with children would be fine ,0,didnt
1,1,129, It was well maintained and it was so pretty Its a bit sad that I didnt see my beluga friends but Im very satisfied ,1,didnt
2,2,138,It was a lot nicer than I expected Since it was so small I didnt think there would be much to see However there were a lot of sea animals There are stations where you can feed the fish My personal favorite was seeing the beluga ,2,didnt
3,3,156, I watched it with no expectations so I didnt expect much ,3,didnt
4,4,169, I didnt realize the time was passing because I was watching the fish in the large tank such as beluga and otter penguins and so cute ,4,didnt
5,5,194,My son had a lovely time The exhibits were interesting and varied The facilities were clean and even during covid the rules were followed but you didnt feel it Go during the week for fewer crowds no ,5,didnt
6,6,196, It had the most fish species but it didnt feel grand and big The sea lion show was fun ,6,didnt
7,0,36, Too many people even though there are too many Im really lost I think it would be better to limit the number of entries ,7,number
8,1,124,Bigger than I expected good variety of fish but many of the tanks seem too small for the species of fish or the number,8,number
9,2,146, Expectations are low because it is located in the tallest building in Korea The number of fish species the viewing window and the entrance fee are not ,9,number
10,3,224, Compared to other aquariums the overall number of individuals seems to be small It seemed pity that there was only one beluga alone in the large beluga aquarium ,10,number
11,4,263,"Having been to a number of more interesting aquariums in Asia, this one is not particularly interesting. Unless someone in the gang craves for it, can pass.",11,number
12,5,316,"There are still a number of interesting displays. A room of jellyfish, a huge tank with lots of fish, two beluga whales, a spot for kids to touch fish and other small water creatures, baby otters, an alligator, and a few other tanks with different fish. It was a great way to spend several hours in the afternoon. The great thing is it's in Lottes' World Mall, which has tonnes of other things to do, so the Aquarium can be a one thing in a full day of stuff, all in the same location.",12,number
13,0,16, Its hard to see even a 4 star beluga because of the lack of manatee ,13,even
14,1,24, It would be nice if there was a plan for activation such as consideration for visitors and events ,14,even
15,2,31, Very nice and friendly aquarium well signposted cjemin spread over 3 floors if I remember correctly But even though it was amazing to see a narwhal it needs more space ,15,even
16,3,36, Too many people even though there are too many Im really lost I think it would be better to limit the number of entries ,16,even
17,4,65, There are a lot of events so you can actually enter at a price in the low 20000 won range but since you see everything it feels like the regular price ,17,even
18,5,108, Its good to be able to experience an aquarium nearby Shopping and dining at the same time In particular there are event tickets for 3 or 4 people so it is much better ,18,even
19,6,109, You can see the aquarium nearby and there are many experience events inside so there are many things to enjoy Inside cafe goods corner photography feeding etc But unfortunately Its not a very large ,19,even

21,8,200, Lotte World Aquarium visited every two years I was able to visit at a low price through the card company event We issue a 4hour parking pass so it is not burdensome ,21,even
22,9,266,"If you are going to the Gangnam area any way, apart from visiting the shopping mall, you may wish to reserve time for this aquarium. It is not a very big one and the advantage is that it is actually inside the Coex Mall and is wholly indoor. Though it is compact variety of fish is good. You can see shark, turtles, penguins, and many more. You can spend two hours there, and worth going even if you have one hour and are thinking what to do. Kids will enjoy.",22,even
23,10,275,"Went here with a couple of friends, all in our twenties. We all thought it was an amazing time. We paid 60.000 won (50€) each, for a package deal including the aquarium, lotte tower and lotte world. And even though all three are worth a visit, the aquarium was the best. Having some great displays of fish and other animals like penguins, otters and whales.  The aquarium is in the same building as the lotte tower, and mall. Which are both enormous, with tons of stores and restaurants.",23,even
24,11,278,"What an amazing aquarium. The tanks are so clean you can't even tell there is glass. Great exhibits. Beluga whales, penguins, octopus that was full on display, sea lions, and otters. Plus so many fish. Lots of underwater tunnels. Best aquarium I've ever been too!",24,even
25,12,313,"For the prices, we were expecting a great aquarium. I may have been spoiled by the ones in Cinncinatti OH, and New Orleans, La, but this one missed the mark. Pretty standard and nothing special. We were kinda shocked when we got to the end and even the kids asked if that was the whole thing. Took maybe 30 minutes to get through and we paid almost 90 bucks.",25,even
26,13,325,"We arrived aroun on Valentine’s Day at noon and were finished around 2pm. We payed 29,000KRW or about $24 for two hours! The shows occur around 11:00am and then again 4pm. We figured we would get our hands stamped and check out the Lotte Duty Free and Mall (My wife’s idea lol) and then return to see the Sea Lion and Beluga Whales’ show. To our profound amazement, they wouldn’t stamp our hand so we could return. They spoke decent English for purchasing tickets and for renting the audio guide but all of the sudden, the English proficient customer help didn’t speak a word of English as I tried to get our hands stamped to return. All they could say was they are sorry. Even with listening to the audio guide, the entire trip lasted 2 hours including multiple trips to the restroom by 4 people in a family, snacks such as a pretty decent churro etc… Had we not purchased the rental audio guides, the entire aquarium could be seen in under an hour as it is very tiny. One would think they would give the audio guide for free with the 29,000KRW price but then the audio guide rental is another 3,000KRW a person. Unlike the museums we’ve encountered with children and great teacher supervision, here parents let their children run wild here and even try to push you out of the way to let their children get a view. I could understand a child trying to get a good view and pushing, not having common sense or decency, but a parent pushing you out of the way? That was ridiculous and I surely told the parents to have some civility. What a waste of money and time with the Lotte World Aquarium. If you are considering or contemplating spending your hard earned money on Lotte World Aquarium I strongly advise you spend your money elsewhere and avoid the frustrations my family felt visiting the poorly run Lotte World Aquarium.",26,even
27,14,329,"We had expected much from this new Aquarium, but, it seems that it was designed by someone who hadn't designed or experienced the top Aquariums in the world, which bring fun, and, sensory-enhancing experiences, and, which are educational, interactive, and, family-oriented, This Lotte Aquarium is somewhat educational, but, it wasn't cohesive, and, even shabby.  1.5 hour was sufficient, and, we felt we were at a “temporary” exhibits, although every feture was permanent. The best part was the staff at the ticketing area, who are many times friendlier and cheerful than other Lotte employees throughout the 2-3 buildings, where their staff are alarmingly indifferent, lazy, and below-average in work ethics, due to the discouraging fact that the locals and the government did not support this new development but criticized them heavily when they first opened in 2014. Since the ground breaking day, Lotte have had nothing but the series of serious environmental issues, construction-related accidents, and, customer injuries, and the luxury item stores premature shutdowns due to mis-targeting consumer groups, and, the worsened public transport access discouraged anyone to go there for shopping. I tend to think this might be the embarrassing example of the poor-sighted development by a 2nd class developer, with the rushed oversighted process. Well, the Aquarium program is also a typical example to me.  Compared to top-notched Ripley's Aquarium in Toronto (AA), or, solid ancient Boston Aquarium (A), it wasn't even B-, it is at best C+. They need to reprogram the routes around the gigantic water tanks, and bring more interactive fun, starting with music and light effect for the visitors.  The Entrance fee was steep at 29,000 won ($25). Not a good value for the visit. They open late till 10pm. If you were disappointed, I suggest exploring the new Lotte World Tower Mall (Aquarium in B1 level). It has lots of late night dinner places at the upper levels that you will experience the good authentic Korean dishes and snacks on 5th floor. They close at around 11:30~12pm.",27,even

41,13,270,"This is a popular aquarium in Lotte World. We weren't impressed. But, it's good to visit with kids once.  - It is 10~15 min walk from Lotte World Mall Entrance. Not that close. - Entrance fee is quite expensive. There are various discount rules by the way. Some of them will be available for foreigners too. Check the website before purchasing tickets. - We waited 20~30 min to buy the ticket. I was disappointed because we didn't have many people before us and their kind work is not that quick. - It was very crowded on weekday afternoon. We waited for our turn to see tanks mostly. I don't know how it's going to be worse on weekend. - The inside was dark. Not easy to get good photos. - They allow big strollers and it was pretty annoying for others. Sometimes those are risky when people don't notice in a dark area. - This is very ENTERTAINMENT friendly aquarium. They seemed take much efforts to attract family visitors. As well as watching and touching, they have various experience programs like scuba diving. If you are more leaning on underwater sanctuary, you'll probably be disappointed seeing fishes and marine creatures looping in relatively small tanks for them. - Unlike other common aquariums having the souvenir shops at the end, they have so many shops and food stalls on the way. - They don't have giant sharks like above three meter long. Instead, they have penguins, otters, sealions, etc. Belluga whales are the highlight of this aquarium. - The scale is smaller than we thought. It will take 1~2 hours if you don't staty long at each tank.",41,much
42,14,283,"Situated just at the city of seoul. After enjoying lotte world we went to Lotte aquarium. We were not expecting too much as we already been to many Ocean parks but to our suprise. They have 2 “Beluga Whale” yes a whale! aside from sharks, rays, big fishes, seals, sea turtles and penguins. So amazing. it was not a huge as ocean parks but what you can find inside will definitely satisfy you.",42,much
43,15,311,"it is inside a shopping mall and boy, the place is so huge that my feet were aching from all the walking. The area was well-kept and the marine animals look so happy!  the star of the aquarium was dugong and they were seen playing happily with balls and swimming around the huge tank. they appeared to be smiling and at times, they are seen swimming near to the visitors posing for photo taking  there are also quite a few backdrops for visitors to take photos, e.g. since i went during autumn and close to halloween, there is a backdrop that decorated with halloween pictures and items and another backdrop we saw is decorated with autumn related items. i think it is a wonderful idea. i saw many families with kids & couples are posing with the beautiful decorated backdrops.  there is also a small section for kids or anyone to do a touch/free of the starfish or other small marine creatures and dont worry about getting your hands dirty as there are washing basins with soaps right next to it!  as compared to S.E.A. aquarium that we have in Singapore Sentosa, i think this Lotte World Aquarium is much more fun. or maybe it's just me.. :)  There is also ample of space that is friendly for strollers, families and couples..  i would definitely recommend this place to my friends",43,much
44,16,315,"If you don't have much to do, and are trying to kill 1-2 hours, this is a decent aquarium to attend. I might be biased, as the Osaka and Atlanta aquarium have set me with high standards. BUT, I do believe that this aquarium (compared to some of the best in the world) is sort of expensive, for what it has to offer. I believe that I either paid the same or more, to attend this aquarium, compared to top-rated aquariums, like the ones in Osaka, Japan and Atlanta, GA (USA). That being said, the animals/mammals that they have inside the aquarium seem to be well fed and have enough room to get around. If you go on the weekend, plan for it to be packed, as it was for our last trip. My family and I have went during the week, and there was no line to feed the fish or do anything other ""extra"" activities within the aquarium. Plan for a 10-20 minute wait on the weekends for those activities. All of this being said, this aquarium is NOT BAD, it's just sort of pricey, for what it has to offer. I recommend going here at least once, whether you're on vacation, or just trying to kill time. If you drive to Lotte World mall, you get a discount for the parking (if you attend the aquarium), so keep your receipt, as the parking is the most expensive as I've ever seen.",44,much
45,17,317,"What can I say. I've been to much bigger and much more interesting Aquariums in the world. This one has a few interesting exhibits, the usual seal show, and two small beluga whales. It's a nice place for little kids, so they not get overwhelmed. I was done within an hour and would not go back.  But this is a small part of a massive underground shopping / recreation area (underneath the new skyscraper tower that's almost finished). So you have other things to do in the vicinity, and the ticket seems to be valid for the Lottery Amusement Park (connected by an underground passage). So not entirely a lost day...",45,much
46,18,324,"Walking though the aquarium was fun for all the family. It isn't cheap to get in, but it was worth the money and got the audio guide to complement the trip.  This is a great way to spend a decent amount of time with the family. My young one was gawking at walking under neath some portions of the aquarium and trying to get the seal to play with him through the glass.  There were fish and species I have never seen at other aquariums. A few of the seals had sense of humors and would play along with children movements swimming up to kids and following their hands around like a large shadow. There is so much information that if you want to read and learn about all of it please block of a decent amount of time. I would say three hours would be minimum.",46,much
