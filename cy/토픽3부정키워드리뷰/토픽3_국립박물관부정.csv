0,0,145, When I was in middle school I visited a certain museum on a school trip but I guess I just looked around because I wasnt interested At that time I did not know where I was visiting and I was busy playing with my ,0,guess
1,1,331,The museum is big and has lots of interesting rooms with history of Korea There is quite a great view of the N Seoul Tower from there and they have shops where you can buy souvenirs related to the antiques that you will see in the museum I went to the museum on the weekend and I didnt have to pay an entrance fee I guess the entrance is free on the weekends You are allowed to take pictures of the different exhibition rooms they have but you are going to be requested to go through an Xray security checkpoint before entering the hall where the exhibition rooms are I highly recommend you to go to this museum if you are interested in the history of Korea and of course if you are willing to spend two to three hours there because the museum is huge,1,guess
2,2,620,This a huge museum separated into two annexes so that two different exhibits can be curated at the same time There is also a Children Museum i guess for the young ones And there are a few gardens too  Easily reached from Ichon train station It is almost opposite the National Hangeul Museum Admission fees applies,2,guess
3,3,746,The museum building and grounds are very pretty and has its own train station  The first floor inside is the most interesting part in terms of history everything else is for art lovers I guess and people who can appreciate ceramics Would be great if they had more exhibits like maybe what prehistoric animals  dinosaurs they had in Korea  If you had to choose between this and the war museum go to the war museum Wouldnt spend too long here,3,guess
4,4,952,This a huge museum separated into two annexes so that two different exhibits can be curated at the same time There is also a Children Museum i guess for the young ones And there are a few gardens too  Easily reached from Ichon train station It is almost opposite the National Hangeul Museum Admission fees applies,4,guess
5,5,1099,High class Museum Very modern design easy navigation through the various rooms and topics large enough not to be crowded concise explanations in English too free yes  and fantastic items on show It was a pleasure all the way visiting this Museum Note If you just want to walk through only stopping briefly in front a few spectacular pieces I guess about 15 hrs are necessary A more quiet visit may need about twice as much Id advise at least 2 hrs and be selective as there are very diverse topics exposed that are not likely to be of interest for everybody,5,guess
6,6,1146,The place is so vast and if youre into history you should visit this place You will learn not only about Korea but also other countries I guess this is one of the biggest museum in the world,6,guess
7,7,1209,It is AWESOME if you want history BOOM you got it The Food is okay I guess But for history lovers it is going to be awesome,7,guess
8,8,1354,I guess it depends on your interests but I found the set up very good but you can only see that much of pots until it gets boring Still well worth a visit but stay away from the food  coffee,8,guess
9,9,1480,I guess you should judge a Museum by its contents primarily but it must be said that the building is quite stunning Free admission English tours and English language guide maps make a visit very easy and enjoyable I found the antiquities from Neolithic through to Silla period very rewarding some superb gold royal regalia and the usual array of stone and iron weapons and implements Large pottery display An uninformed guess would be that Korea may well still have a lot of archaeological work still to come Excellent video explanation of the construction of the funerary mounds I had just seen in Gyeongju over the previous daysMore audio visual stuff we did not explore on a short visit I did not have time to check out the arts and crafts and painting on the floors above A restaurant onsite which looked good but we patronised the food courtcoffee shop which was fine Lots of staff usual Korean courtesy and welcome,9,guess
10,10,1489,beautiful museum in nice setting but it was ok Most of their displays were in korean so I lost interest when I got there If they want people to know about their history or culture they should display in multiple language I guess thats just me,10,guess
11,0,51, The restaurant is so crowded the wait is over an hour and a halfthere is nothing to eat at the convenience store ,11,nothing
12,1,367,The museum is in a wonderful modern complex with a huge building housing some artefacts from various ages  Ill be honest I like a museum but this one didnt do it for me I felt they struggled to fill it and what they had was interesting but nothing special,12,nothing
13,2,591,If youre alone and nothing to do this is the thing for you to do  Theres a few sections in this museum but Id say the hanguel museum is the best interactive and very informative Its free Its accessible by metro Just right outside the station Forgot which one sorry,13,nothing
14,3,618,Very boring Nothing interesting Just artifacts that describes nothing War Museum was way more interesting and you learn way more from that museum,14,nothing
15,4,751,Visited the national museum this august As an Asian Studies student it was quite intersting seeing how they kept referring to china in the museum and it basically looked as though Korea is nothing more than a side effect of the chinese rise  The museum offers a free tour a couple of times a day The guide didnt actually know english and basically just stated whats written about the artifacts but it was still nice  Id very much reccomend this place for a rainy day It also has beautiful gardens nearby if you deel like a light stroll,15,nothing
16,5,785,The arrival there is made very simple and easy so much so you can easily visit with whatever weather The park surrounding the huge museum is beautiful and a lot of local kids enjoyed it I at first visited the right now ongoing exhibition on Sinan Shipwreck and found it very interesting along with impressing worth the 5000 won I payed to see treasures of a past time From there I moved into the free National Museum where you could probably spend a day or several taking in the huge collection I ended up picking specific rooms to go to in order not to lose myself in the huge establishment There are walking tours at certain times  I decided to explore on my own Once you enter the rooms of the displays quiet surrounds you along with beautiful pieces of art It was a bit distracting with the loud children but then again that is nothing is new either There are rooms upon rooms filled with treasures  the signs are in Korean English Chinese and Japanese Outside the spaces are several bathrooms and places where you can have a drink of water The building is huge and a wonderful trip all together Only thing I have to admit is that the architecture part didnt really overwhelm me  the interior is beautiful and clear cut the outside look is okay  PS Was lucky enough to even catch a live performance before the entrance to the museum,16,nothing
17,6,938,If youre alone and nothing to do this is the thing for you to do  Theres a few sections in this museum but Id say the hanguel museum is the best interactive and very informative Its free Its accessible by metro Just right outside the station Forgot which one sorry,17,nothing
18,7,951,Very boring Nothing interesting Just artifacts that describes nothing War Museum was way more interesting and you learn way more from that museum,18,nothing
19,8,1190,So you know nothing of the history of Korea Well dont feel left out few do outside the peninsula Although its not as exciting as Japanese Shoguns and Samurai or Chinese walls to keep out Mongolian invaders Korean history has its sparkle as well The museum is vast and wellkept Its practically free considering the prices of museums in Europe and America There are gardens at the back of the building that are beautiful and quite peaceful,19,nothing
20,9,1230,An acceptable attraction if you have a couple of hours to spare The museum is free and easy to get to it has its own subway station however I wouldnt put it at the top of my hit list if I was back in Seoul The displays are interesting up until a certain point but there is very little variation in what you see I saw a lot of pottery and weaponry but nothing interactive However the 12 story Pagoda in the center of the hall is worth seeing,20,nothing
21,10,1324,If you know nothing about Koreas history the national museum is a great place to learn a bit about it I spent around 6 hours there and enjoyed very much this museum It is very well organized There is a restaurant there with good food and not so expensive The outside area is also beautiful especially during autumn time,21,nothing
22,11,1471,My family enjoyed their trip to the museum very much there was nothing I disliked about the place and particulary liked that there was lots of info in English for us foreign visitors,22,nothing
23,12,1482,The building is huge and grand It is relatively sparse inside There is a comprehensive display of Korean history and artifacts from various periods It is interesting but nothing extraordinary perhaps the best thing is that it is free,23,nothing
24,13,1543,The architecture is as fascinating as the exhibits and the museum is laid out very well allowing you to move through time periods sequentially The permanent displays are free and there are food facilities inside and outside One down point  there doesnt seem to be the same peaceful museum etiquette in Korea as there is in the West So expect loud adults and children alike the sound echoing around the halls with the curators doing nothing about it,24,nothing
25,14,1555,I was surprised to read that some felt that this was a boring trip with lots of historical artifacts and nothing else Its a museum Thats what a museum is all about   I took the English tour provided twice daily with a nice man who told us about the religious history emphasized the importance of the movable metal type that they have and showed us the gold crown and gave us a detailed history on it Along with his 1 12 hour tour I spent 4 hours there and it was well worth it Go only if you are expecting history you know because it is a museum ;  Oh And it is free for the general exhibit D,25,nothing
