0,0,371,"Ok, we were here on a Saturday night which is probably not ideal as it is very busy.  The rides are mainly for little kids, so, nothing too exciting for adults. We wanted to go on the hot air balloon ride but the queue was 2 hrs. We queued for about 1/2hr for the monorail ride but because it’s winter, half of the ride route was cancelled, so, it was a very short one.  Some nice photo ops outside at the Disney looking castle, so, make sure you go out of the building & walk around a bit.  We were lucky that there was a Christmas parade - this was the highlight of this visit.",0,probably
1,1,377,"The warmth in the indoor theme park was very welcome with the freezing cold outside. However, the indoor rides were more for smaller kids less than 12 years old probably. Very long queues on a holiday and weekend. We stayed in an AirBnB across the theme park so transportation was not a problem.",1,probably
2,2,437,"Lotte is a well-known chain in Korea, and its hotels have a somewhat formulaic uniformity. Lotte World has a rather dated feel and look - it was probably the bees knees twenty or thirty years ago, but doesn't seem to have moved with the times. The staff during my stay were impeccable - polite and efficient, if rather lacking in warmth. My double room was comfortable, functional, and equipped with the sort of items that one needs and expects in a hotel of this level, but faded. The wallpaper and carpet looked as though they should have been changed years ago, and the shower over the bath tub was a Heath-Robinson arrangement. The corridor carpets were equally in need of changing, and the space was pervaded by a musty smell, that may be a legacy of the days when smoking was common in the corridors and rooms. I didn't think much of the dining options: a Chinese place on a high floor (which I didn't try) and a buffet place on the second floor (which I did). The hotel lacks a simple coffee shop type restaurant where one can order a simple dish from a menu. There are plenty of better hotel options in Seoul.",2,probably
3,3,490,"This amusement is vertically huge, ranges from b3 to 4th floor. It can be very confusing when you first reach there. Be sure to get a copy of the map at the info counter after you enter located at 1st floor.  I entered by the south gate and arrived at the 1st floor playground for young children. They cater rides to kids below the height of 100cm and there were variety.  If you walk further towards the centre of the theme park on 1st floor, you reached the place where the carousel and viking is. There are other rides on 1st floor for older kids and adults. Most rides height requirement is about 110cm. The more thrilling ones probably above 130cm.  2nd floor leads to the outdoor theme park where most of the thrill rides are. There are also lots of cafes and restaurants on the 2nd floor indoors as well as 2 other adventure rides.  3rd floor houses another 3 more adventure rides and 4th floor is where the hot air ballon ride is.  Well it’s really crazily big and we didn’t have the time to complete all the rides as we were rushing off to the aquarium. Spent a total of 6 hrs there. Study the map, plan your time wisely and you will be able to get on most rides. Magic pass that helps skip queues save time. But sometimes the queue for magic pass can also be quite long for popular rides.  Comparatively, I prefer everland as it is an outdoor theme park and there is a zoo within the park itself. Also it is easier to locate the rides in everland.",3,probably
4,4,561,Outdoor rides were all closed. Thus the queue for the indoor rides were crazily long.  I would go again in spring or summer probably.,4,probably
5,5,745,"This is amazing place. I absolutely love it. I'd definitely go there again. If you love carousels, slides and different entertainment, you'll love it here. But be ready for long queues. I spent more time waiting in line than riding. The staff are friendly but English is a problem for the local population. And in case it's not cheap. Plus you probably will spend some money for ice cream or a sandwich, all this and more you can buy there easily. Just be sure you have enough money.",5,probably
6,6,757,"This indoor theme park would probably be really enjoyable for children under 10 and their parents. As two adults, we found majority of the rides quite tame. The rides that looked like they would be more appropriate for us had massive queues of over 2 hours (on a weekday) and the magic passes had all been used. We used the discount coupon from the airport bus ticket but it still was an expensive day due to the limited appropriate rides.",6,probably
7,7,790,"We came here on our recent visit to Seoul. The place is on the expensive side even for us American (approx $250USD for 2 adults and 2 children under 5-the price incl all rides) but we spent a whole day in there and my kids are happy. We were lucky that the lines weren't terribly long. Only the balloon ride took about 40 mins wait, the rest probably 5-10 mins. All the rides are well taken care of, super clean and the staff is friendly. Plenty of foods nearby and they are not that expensive. We got lost trying to find this place, it was pretty long walk from the station. Their Xmas parade was a hit with my kids. The parade was even better at night time. We didn't try the Ice Skating ring ourselves but they looked wonderful. Try to come here with a tour company because they will be able to get you discounted tickets.",7,probably
8,8,808,"Hi!  Lotte world was a last minute decision because we were bored in Seoul after being there for 10 days. And I have to say it was a well spent day:) it is easily accessible by train to jamsil! I went on a Monday and the queue was not too long, probably a 15mins average waiting time! I went from 11am to 6pm and I managed to ride almost all the rides.  Heads up first, for those who love crazy scary rides, this probably will not satisfy you 100%. However, for those like me, who enjoy a moderate level of fear rides, this will be an enjoyable trip! They do have one roller coaster that was said to be the scariest, but I didn't try it so I can't comment. However judging by the speed, loops I saw and the screams I heard, it should be satisfying for any fear-seekers.  The coolest part about this park was that it was indoors and outdoors. I loved the outdoors more cause it had more fun rides there! There was a ride I loved so much I went on it for at least 3 times. Furthermore, they had those cycle sea ducks I always see on korean variety shows that was free!  Overall this was one of the better theme parks I've been! Should give it a shot^^",8,probably
9,9,813,"Walking in I was delighted, walking out I was so glad to leave. We went on a Tuesday, got there at 11 (place opened at 9:30), went to the Comet, located in the outdoor section of the park (Magic) which we thought would be like Space Mountain from what I saw online. Wait time said 80 minutes. I would estimate we waited for 2 hours before we got on the actual ride, which was vaguely Space-Mountain-ish and mildly entertaining, but certainly not worth the wait. It was hot, so we went back inside to try to find another ride. All the ""thrill"" (coaster-type) rides listed a 120 minutes wait, which probably meant 2.5 hours. We wandered around inside a bit more (it is pretty cool to look at - they cram so much inside, including people!) until we decided to bail. A complete waste of money. Tried to be Disney but failed in every way. Disinterested employees, rides with too little capacity, signs ineffective (no lie, it took us 25 minutes to find the way back out to the street!). If you must go, don't pay the all-inclusive ticket (48,000 won for adults, barely cheaper for kids), pay the cheaper ticket price, wander around and pay for rides as you go (supposedly you have this option), if you can actually get on any.",9,probably
10,10,822,"When we were in Seoul we wanted to do an amusement park. We were told there were two good ones and this one was better for younger kids. Since we had an 8 year old that enjoys roller coasters we thought it'd be better to do this one and if we came back in the future to do the other park. We had a great time here.  We took the subway and it was very easy to walk there from the station. This park is about 2/3 inside and 1/3 outside. We did most of the inside and only a few of the outside, as it was raining and when it's wet they close the outdoor coasters. They did open them in the afternoon but not all and we didn't get to do everything.  Inside there are 4 floors. On the top is an Egyptian ride we liked probably best of all with lots of cool replicas and stuff, and a hot air balloon ride which went around the entire inside part. It was a cool view and there was a special tunnel part but the wait was crazy long!  On the 3rd floor was the monorail but it was closed because of the rain. And another ride called Jungle Adventure. The 2nd floor has a fast roller coaster and bumper cars.  The 1st floor had most of the rides from a swinging boat, a water ride with a big splash, carousel, and a ride with a 360 on it. There was a ride called Drunken Basket which was like the mad hatter tea cups at Disneyland.  Below the 1st floor you could see a big ice skating rink, but we did not go down there. I cost extra.  Outside was one of those ride where you site in a big ring around a tower that goes all the way to the top and then drops you (I hate those) in your seat and goes partially back up and does it again a few times. There were two coasters that were closed, a walk through ghost house, a ferris wheel, magic show and more. One part of the haunted house scared/upset my son a little bit with a cat becoming a ghost. There was also a big castle you could walk through outside.  There were several shows/performances with people in costumes. They seemed geared toward little (under 6 crowd) on the first floor. There was a tram that came through and there were ladies hanging off the side like Vegas show girls, very sparkly with exotic outfits. The park has two main mascots, Lotty and Lorry and their faces and likeness were on lots of things throughout the park. There were some animatronics.  They park did have a fast pass type thing called Magic Pass to get a ticket to go to the front of the line at a later time. You constantly had to show your admission ticket to ride things since they have an all day unlimited and a like 10 ride pass. I lost mine but they didn't make a big deal about replacing it, though they said I only get one replacement.  There were a lot of food options with a good amount of variety actually. You could get Korean food, hotdogs, pizza, burgers, Chinese, kebabs, and more. The food we got wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either.  There were lots of shops to buy things at and we bought some cat ear headbands that my son loved so much he wore the rest of our trip in Korea.  Our visit was such a very fun day. If you have kids under 13, this is a great place to go!",10,probably
11,11,836,"We visited Lotte World on a Monday for my son's birthday and it was such a good time! We took advantage of the 50% off with military ID (or dependent) - thankfully had the kids IDs too since it's only good for 4 tickets. We spent 5 hours there and no one did everything but we filled every minute with fun. The teenagers and tweens took off and did their own thing at the park, even managed to get their ticket replaced on their own when one of them lost theirs. Reminder, you need to show your ticket at every ride so keep it handy and on each person if possible. They did the indoor roller coasters and outdoor ones as well. The moms took the younger set to do all that was available and didn't get through all of it! Fair food is very good, especially the soda/fried cheese balls combo, always a hit with my guys. 9 year olds went on the log flume solo which was about a 15 minute wait at 12 noon and loved it. Too bad our favorite ride, the Dinosaur 3D target practice was closed for inspection. And the kids really enjoyed the trick eye exhibit on 4F. This is our 3rd visit in a year and we still haven't done it all. Took the subway there and back. Couldn't be easier or more enjoyable. Will probably go again!",11,probably
12,12,870,"I went on a Sunday (probably should have avoided the weekend) but managed to ride all of the adult attractions in a day & really enjoyed myself. Yes the wait in the lines can be quite long but there is wifi & sometimes you can get bumped up the line if you are flying solo.  I really recommend the French revolution, Atlantis & Comet express rides if you are into roller-coasters.  The food onsite was rather average although the treats (icecream, etc) were good.",12,probably
13,13,877,"After the initial greeting of sweet, fresh faced staff that wave a lot in such a cute Lotte World way you are immediately overwhelmed by the sheer scale of this wonderland. And we are yet to get outside. Indoors is probably more suited to the little people of this world, I mean children but there are still things for the grown ups to do but its outside that you will really be in your element. Apart from the huge ques (30-60min for the popular ones) the rides at this place are pretty awesome though not entirely new and original. But it's a gas and great to immerse in the Korean candy world of a theme park. Off the shelf prices are pretty high but there seems to be many ways to get a discount.",13,probably
14,14,912,"Our family has been to Disney World 7 times. If Disney World is what you are looking for, I would highly recommend you start saving and I mean SAVING. So, no, Lotte World is not Disney World and it's never going to be Disney World, but it also doesn't charge what Disney World charges. If you are trying to decide whether or not to take your kids to Lotte World, then just go. For the price you simply can't beat it. We took our daughter for her 9th birthday, and she is a thrill ride junky. Lucky for us the outside area opened up (it was raining early that morning), and the rides on Magic Island were open and running. There are several rides inside that she enjoyed, but most of the indoor rides and for little kids. As a family, we had a blast. There is a great variety of rides for our 9 year old AND our 3 year old. Here are some key things you need to know prior to going; 1. They are very strict about the height requirement for every single ride. In fact, they will probably measure your kids and then slap a wrist band on them (similar to the type you get at the hospital), indicating the height of your child. There is no smooth talking any of the attendants, if your kid misses the height by an inch, that's it, they don't make it on the ride. 2. If you do not favor Korean food, they have hotdogs, corn dogs, a hamburger joint, and a pizza place. The pizza looked off, and we attempted to order 4 beef hamburgers for approx. 5 solid minutes, and we got everything from shrimp burgers to chicken patties on the tray. We ended up just taking the chicken patties, which were a little off. They came with mayo and teriyaki sauce on them. We didn't like them at all. The parking is easy to get to, but since Lotte World is in a busy part of the city, I would recommend the subway system. 3. You have to be 6 years or older to skate on the ice rink. We brought socks for everyone but decided not to go when we found out our 3 year old couldn't skate. 4. Once you leave Lotte World there is no reentry. We were looking smack dab at a TGIFs but couldn't get to it because we wouldn't be allowed back in. Bottom Line - GO FOR IT. It's definitely worth it. The lines were very short, usually waited about 10 minutes per ride. Go, have fun, we did!",14,probably
15,15,917,"Its very small in terms of size or and facilities. A lot of the outdoor rides are close. In terms of technologies, they are really outdated as compared to Everland.  If you have small children, probably they will still enjoy Lotte World. But if yours are teens, then don't waste the entrance tickets fee",15,probably
16,16,928,"Lotte world has been featured in a number of korean dramas. I went there because I watched those dramas. I was quite disappointed at the scale and the facilities there. Most probably my expectations of lotte world are really high. If treat it as a normal amusement park for kids, it is a good choice.",16,probably
17,17,930,"If you've been to other theme parks, this one is a bit old and it seems nothing new there. We waited 30-80mins for one game, probably because it was near new year. But it's always fun to go with your friends, family, or special one.",17,probably
18,18,966,"I like going to theme parks , specially with friends, and when in Seoul, Lotte World is a must visit. . . . . only if you just want to be done with a checklist with Lotte World listed on it . Sure , the place is cool, the indoor and outdoor park is great , what I only was not prepared for was the long waiting time to be able to ride an attraction. The lines are awfully long , and I went there on a regular school day, and during winter. I wonder how long the lines are during weekends? One thing is sure the Seoulites do enjoy their theme park with much fervor. I'm beginning to visualize the lines once the Universal Park opens in Seoul. I enjoyed roaming around the indoor park and watching the Parade and the light show at closing time. Will probably have second thoughts about visiting again , the long lines really are a big turn-off.",18,probably
19,19,993,"The warmth in the indoor theme park was very welcome with the freezing cold outside. However, the indoor rides were more for smaller kids less than 12 years old probably. Very long queues on a holiday and weekend. We stayed in an AirBnB across the theme park so transportation was not a problem.",19,probably
20,20,1219,"Nothing special. Too pricey. Too long a queue for the games, wasting time waiting for the ride etc. Magic island is probably better with more scenic views.",20,probably
21,21,1221,"This place really is incredible to view. The design and overall appearance of the precinct is nearly breathtaking. It is a shame however that unless you're willing to stand in lines of at least an hour, you can't really do much. Any of the attractions that are really worth going on are minimum hour sometimes significantly more. The locals didn't seem to mind and perhaps that's a cultural thing but lining up for an hour then having a five minute ride, only to line up for another hour wore thin very quickly. I could only imagine it with a couple of kids (although again, no local kids seemed to mind from what I could tell!). Steep entry fee but it probably is worth a look just to actually view the place.",21,probably
22,22,1294,"You could spend a whole day here, or even two, and still not see every single part of it. Lotte world is massive, like... really big. And it's got absolutely everything you could want. In terms of shopping, it's probably the biggest mall in S. Korea, and it's got every store you can think of, and every item you may need. The food hall was my favourite place to go when I needed something a little more western, and it's well connected by subway so it's also a great place to go during the winter months. And when you get bored of shopping, there's the amusement park. I had heard a lot about Lotte World Amusement Park and I was interested in seeing how they'd make it work being indoors. I've got to say they've done it pretty well. Spread over a few floors, the themeing is beautifully done and you tend to forget that outside there's a mall full of busy shoppers. It is geared towards younger children, but the rides are still super fun, and there are a few thrill rides to keep the adults happy. There's the usual korean food brands, and a loads of confectionary stands. You can even buy facial products! I'd definitely recommend checking it out if you have a spare day.",22,probably
23,23,1313,"This is probably the biggest entertainment complex in seoul. You have from low end to high end products in this cpomplex, from cheap food to expensive restaurant. Indoor amusement park and indoor aquarium in the same complex. Its beyond real. You need days to finish it all. Good with kids and family.",23,probably
24,24,1328,If you are interested in shopping you must visit this mall as it is probably.the biggest in town. This complex also has the tallest building in the city. Crowds of Chinese tourist come for their shopping.,24,probably
25,25,1348,"We were visiting Seoul and our hotel had a shuttle to the lotte World - we not dropped there, We did not feel ike paying 45$ for the rides even if for a week day it is probably ok as there is no much lines. Walk down the skate rink and watch all these future speed skater olympic winners.. Then walk yourself out, cross the street and walk toward the castle, you can enter the beer garden (baden-baden) and enjoy a Kloud (the only acceptable Korean beer IMO) in the sun...",25,probably
26,26,1354,"Definitely a great place for kids and families, as long as your kids don't mind the wait. My husband and I went by ourselves over a holiday weekend because they had a 50% discount for foreigners. The lines were just unbearable, but I suppose this is Korea. Because half of the park is indoors, I felt very overwhelmed by all the noises and people. If you can go on a weekday when the lines aren't so long, it's probably worth it.",26,probably
27,27,1368,"I was stationed in Korea and the KATUSA's we worked with took us there. Best experience ever! Three levels of everything you can imagine looking down at the huge ice skating rink at the bottom. The outdoor rides were phenomenal. There wasn't as long a wait in line as most people suggested. The perk of having Korean Nationals as friends, they knew the best time to go. Stay hydrated summer and winter. I'm from Florida and the summers there are much milder. You probably wouldn't die of heatstroke like at Disney, still hydrate. This place is a definite must do.",27,probably
28,28,1432,I traveled to south korea with my friend who is a native korean. She and her friends told me it was very popular and good place to go. I thought it was very aged and could do with a little love and care. People pushed in filled with teenagers who checked there hair in the mirror after getting off each ride. Long wait as well. I probably wouldn't go again.,28,probably
29,29,1522,"We went on a Saturday and the queues were very long. Magic passes helped. Would probably have enjoyed it more if there were shorter lines for the rides. The ""big thrill"" rides were too brief for me and were over too soon. Didn't bring kids with me this time but kids would really love this place. Good food also.",29,probably
30,30,1543,"My husband and I decided to visit Lotte World on our last day in Seoul. We went on a Sunday in the late afternoon, hoping to avoid bulk of the crowds. This was not the case. We were warned that it would be busy but with only Disneyland to compare to, we underestimated how popular Lotte World would be. The price of admission was fair, about $25 per adult if I remember correctly. GET A MAP - this place has so many levels and rides everywhere it would be easy to miss something without getting a free map at the info desk.  We didn't get to go on too many rides as waits were were up to 2 hours on some of them. The ones we did visit were great! Well worth the money just to see the largest indoor amusement park in the world. If I were to visit Seoul again, I probably wouldn't go back to Lotte World unless it was in the middle of the week when crowds would be lessened. The size and detail of the park is amazing, but I only felt it was average for the waits and crowds even late on a Sunday. Food selections are OK but not fantastic, prices for souvenirs are less than they would be at comparable parks in the US.",30,probably

35,4,286,"We decided to go to this park on a whim. Lotte world is the biggest indoor theme park (in the world?). It is at the edge of the lotte department store at Jamsil station. If you buy an online ticket you need to walk all the way around the park to the southern gate and then enter that side. It doesnt matter where you leave your bags as the lockers are accessible from several exits of the park.  The park extends outdoors and there are some events centred around halloween. Specifically the indoor haunted house is not very scary but the outdoor house with entry fee of 5000 won is very scary. 5/5 spooks. Rules involved. Don't let go of the rope, no running, don't blind the actors. The wait times in the park are so mixed and with a ticket you only get to reserve 3 rides. I didnt really like this system as some rides are reservation only and can run out very fast. I recommend you book asap for a ride that looks interesting as we missed out on both of the massive indoor roller coasters operating that day. Furthermore the outdoor 3 biggest coasters were all closed for maintenance. A wait time under 30 minutes is tolerable and not worth wasting a magic pass on. The staff were also mind enough to let my friend and I into the same ride even though she was in the reserved session after mine.  My other big complaint is that staff are very unprofessional and let their friends into rides ahead of the queue. There was a halloween show that started 6pm and two friends went in to chat with their mate despite the sign saying it is dangerous for individuals. It also seems impossible to access the ice skating rink without leaving the park. Some staff tell you to leave if you're a foreigner to use the outside escalstor and you won't be let back into the park.",35,didnt
36,5,489,"Ok if you're from the US like I am and are used to going to big theme parks like Universal studios, six flags, and disneyland, then you're going to be disappointed.

I don't know about other countries, but in America, disneyland is so huge that it takes a whole day just to cover one section of the park. Compared to the disneyland in LA, lotte world is like 1/10 the size. It's just so tiny and the rides were not really ""thrilling"" at all. The horror house was literally a 10 minute 3D video for 5 year olds.

The queues for all rides is too long. I waited 120 mins for the hot air balloon which is not that cool after all. While queuing, you can listen to a speaker kept repeating the same sentence on and on in Korean language which makes us very annoying, more like chanting until we found out is actually a greet and bye from the staff when u get down from the rides. No merchandise items were sold inside which double the disappointment for me and my sister. Those plan to visit Korea, this place not an ideal but you can try if u want too.

Many many good quality food stalls for families from snack stands to restaurants. Very large area which does have a little for everybody.  Negative points:- *please check your children’s height before going. We do not have particularly small Children (6+9) but we found out they couldn’t ride the majority of the rides. My 6 year old was even too short for the swings! I don’t know if it was H&S but the sizes were strange. We could only go around the video rides, amusement arcades and a few of the street games. It looks like a magical place but we felt very flat. It feels like a cheaper version of Disney, even down to the red bow. It looses something with all the similarities, there are so many. I would have loved it to be more Korean. Street procession was like a Brazil carnival.  Queueing was 100 minutes for one ride and it was a very humid/rainy day which makes me think on a nicer day it could be worse.  One thing is guaranteed, this place will have you haemorrhaging money. We paid W198,000.00 (family of 4)and that was without the added extras like museum entrance. There are also things like “The Mirror Maze”, darts games and other attractions that will cost you extra, you can buy additional tickets next to the rides for these. It’s a very costly day.  We were left disappointed but that was due to the lack of availability for rides for a 6&9 year old, who have visited many parks and ridden the same rides in other areas. The children felt cheated and upset at constantly not reaching the required height knowing they have ridden it before.",49,found

52,5,323,"We went on a Friday after Memorial day holiday in Seoul. May have been the most stupid time to go other than memorial day itself.  I paid for 3 tickets on Kloop (ticket collection was far away from the main entrance... A good 10-15min walk after asking 3 different people) and added 5 magic passes to two of those tickets for an extra S$100. What a waste of money. The magic pass system is terrible. Every 15 minutes the system opens to allow time slots to be booked to reserve the ride and skip the queue. It has very limited number of time slots each hour and try as we might, for 2 hours we could not reserve anything. Each time the reservation started... It showed all slots filled/closed about 10 seconds after it opened. Eventually all time slots had been reserved and we had to queue with everyone else. So that was $100 down the drain. We didn't ride any of the popular rides because the queues were 90 to 110mins per ride. We were there for 10 hours (until closing time) and rode 5 rides all day. We thought... Screw it let's pay extra to play the VR games.... But no... There's a height restriction and my girl was 5cm below it.  Also, the stupid parade that they run through the main indoor Adventure land around 2pm will section off large areas which cannot be crossed easily or at all (during some parts of the parade). So don't get separated or you won't be able to return until after the parade ends. And all this online advice about going for the popular rides during the parade I found to be bull crap.... The queues were long and getting longer still...  While my 10yr old enjoyed it, as an adult - I wouldn't wish the experience on my worst enemy. Only a parents love for his kids got me through this day.  Just be prepared to queue. Bring your tunes and your headphones, battery pack for your phones, a portable fan (sweaty queues whether indoor or out), snacks, drinks, and pack light. There are plenty of lockers but they are single use so if you do use them then make sure you keep the important stuff with you. One thing I wish I had was a collapsible stool. You will stand for a long long time at Lotte World in queue after queue. I saw some parent bring a picnic mat for the kids to sit and lie on. She was a local with local knowledge.  Food and beverage prices are not super expensive but nor are they cheap. Expect to pay amusement park prices.  I wish I could say something nice about Lotte World but I can't.

So, no, Lotte World is not Disney World and it's never going to be Disney World, but it also doesn't charge what Disney World charges. If you are trying to decide whether or not to take your kids to Lotte World, then just go. For the price you simply can't beat it. We took our daughter for her 9th birthday, and she is a thrill ride junky. Lucky for us the outside area opened up (it was raining early that morning), and the rides on Magic Island were open and running. There are several rides inside that she enjoyed, but most of the indoor rides and for little kids. As a family, we had a blast. There is a great variety of rides for our 9 year old AND our 3 year old. Here are some key things you need to know prior to going; 1. They are very strict about the height requirement for every single ride. In fact, they will probably measure your kids and then slap a wrist band on them (similar to the type you get at the hospital), indicating the height of your child. There is no smooth talking any of the attendants, if your kid misses the height by an inch, that's it, they don't make it on the ride. 2. If you do not favor Korean food, they have hotdogs, corn dogs, a hamburger joint, and a pizza place. The pizza looked off, and we attempted to order 4 beef hamburgers for approx. 5 solid minutes, and we got everything from shrimp burgers to chicken patties on the tray. We ended up just taking the chicken patties, which were a little off. They came with mayo and teriyaki sauce on them. We didn't like them at all. The parking is easy to get to, but since Lotte World is in a busy part of the city, I would recommend the subway system. 3. You have to be 6 years or older to skate on the ice rink. We brought socks for everyone but decided not to go when we found out our 3 year old couldn't skate. 4. Once you leave Lotte World there is no reentry. We were looking smack dab at a TGIFs but couldn't get to it because we wouldn't be allowed back in. Bottom Line - GO FOR IT. It's definitely worth it.

Better to stay near Coex at Park Hyatt if not then Intercontinental or further out at Grand Hyatt.  Lotte World has been around for many years and this review is mainly for the indoor adventure park which is attached to a huge shopping mall. Across the street (intersection) is the Lotte new world mall; the tallest building.  We were able to get discounted tickets for free use of the park for just about 20,000 won each (around 20 US) by using certain promotional related approved credit cards that relied mostly on LG or other card. You can check with the staff there but basically my Korean host paid for it and I chipped in.  On the lowest level is an ice skating rink. On the above levels around it is the adventure park and also folk village (separate entry). Once we paid for our tickets into the park we ate at one of restaurants around the upper level of the rink; found a small buffet called Seven springs which was decent. We then entered the park and spent a nice afternoon watching live performances (there were many and Xmas themed). It made us feel very cheerful for the holiday and the performances were impressive and festive. Especially rock n roll santa Elvis! There was a small gallery within the park that was enjoyable for photos. We did not ride many rides and the monorail we did ride seemed dated. There is an outdoor portion the park but it was too cold to go outside. The mirror maze was fun but a few extra Won just for that attraction. All other attractions were free per our entrance fee. This can be a low-key enjoyable family event and can't comment on if I would just go for the rides there because that's just not my cup of tea. There does seem to be a VR roller coaster (coaster updated with VR googles), various on top of water rides like indoor jungle boat and flume. There's an indoor kids play area which was too packed to stand in line for. The 'balloon' ride circling the park seemed like a very scenic and slow ride more so than monorail. The park has two main characters Lotte and Lorry and they are cute and the concessions cheap enough to wear and have fun with.  The folk village is nice to have nearby for folks who want a taste of Korea and history. For a real taste of Korean history go to Geongbokgung to walk the palace grounds and museum and nearby Insadong to buy souvenirs and tea.  Lotte mall lower level has a food court option I think Hyundai dept stores have more impressive food courts. The mall itself is affordable to expensive depending on what you are looking for.

Therefore, when my age grew up, I determined that I need to complete my wish. On June 2016, I went to Lotte World once time with my friend, and found that it was not so fantastic. It was because that although we woke up early, got to Lotte World, it still many people were waiting to go inside. Moreover, the rapid function was not enough to let we to play all game and rides. The important was that some of games wasn't exciting. Under this situation, I was very disappointment. However, no matter how I disappointment, I still complete my dream.

Overall though nothing to complain about. We enjoyed ourselves throughly.  Didn't check re the ice skating if you have to book in advance (assuming so). Massive rink in the centre of the bottom floor.  Earlier in the day is much quieter than midday to evening. Use fast passes sparingly or later on when it gets busy.

Lines were long even late in the evening, and the indoor section of the park closed down completely from 8:25-9:10 for a ""parade"", which was pretty lame.  Lotte World is pretty old and not that large, though conveniently located in the middle of Gangnam, so considering the value of the land it sits on the park is a reasonable size. The few rides we took (without the long lines) were quite basic... shooting some dragons, a 3D haunted-house movie, and a balloon IMAX movie that my girlfriend found entirely disappointing ... not the balloon simulation that she was expecting. Anything worth riding had a 20-30 minute queue, and just about every line was closed by around 9:30pm, so you just don't get to try anything with the late admission ticket.

The whole place is terribly busy and designed poorly, you feel crampt even not waiting in a line.

The eating areas were open right next to rides so prepare for a noisy experience when you want to relax for lunch. Like dining in a club.  Many attractions inside actually cost money, so when you see a big queue and head for the short queue, you find it costs ₩3000.  The staff were very rude and not fun. They didn't care about their customers and didn't have that fun land happy attitude I would expect from such a place.  All in all the place was dull...

Lotte also made several cartoon characters to advertise their brands. These Korean cuddly characters cover the walls and wander around in costume in the huge, indoor-outdoor Lotte World amusement park. The sheer size of the indoor portion of the park is amazing. It is eight stories from the ice skating rink at the bottom to the balloon ride on the ceiling, all indoors with carnival style mini rides to fair sized roller coasters. None of the rides compare to a Six Flags experience, but it is INDOORS! This is a huge feat of engineering, but more importantly, it makes it a comfortable experience in the monsoon season, the hot and humid summer or the unbearably cold winters. There are more rides outdoors. My 12 year old son loved the two towers. One is a tower drop, the other is a tower shot. They also have another roller coaster and a few other rides outside. When the weather is good, the outdoor rides make it worth the trip for older kids or ride junkies like me. Overall, it is a great destination for families with little kids or older ones looking for something to do in Seoul. Being in the Army, we get US holidays off that allow us to visit tourist destinations on Mondays while the rest of Seoul is in school or at work. I've heard the lines are longer than an hour for most rides on the weekends. We waited 45 minutes for the indoor roller coaster. The weather was perfect, but the lines were much shorter outdoors.

I don't think I need to describe how fun it is in the theme park since they are more or less the same seriously... yeah Lotte World makes you feel joyful and excited when you step in the indoor park, but for real, when you get closer to the ride and once you spot the end of the queue, and start lining up, and wait for 15 mins, and wait for 30 mins, still a long way to go, I am sure you will get mad.

We were annoyed that outside several of the big rides were closed. This was not advertised and was disappointing. Unlike parks in North America, our bags were not searched for food, so we were able to carry in some healthy snacks. We bought lunch and ice cream inside at pretty reasonable prices.

Haunted house needs to be improved! It was super dissapointing that many people were afraid to get into the haunted house but all we just did was to be seated down and watch a 'scary' animation movie which is not even scary to begin with. The department store is not even something I will recommend to go too. If you are coming from places like Singapore, Malaysia, US, Europe, its basically the same store as every other shopping mall.

Plus, the place was packed with local students and I had to queue for 3 hours just for the Atlantis ride and trust me it wasn't pleasant at all. By the time we completed the ride, it was already evening. I would say they're trying to emulate disneyland with the castle and stuffs but boy was i wrong, as it wasn't even a ""fun"" experience at all.

They do have some really awesome rides for adults, but I don't think the adults will be doing the hair and dress up to be a princess for the day. Especially when all the dresses are kids sizes. They have parades and showtimes which are great. Right now they still have the Halloween decorations up in the Halloween shows going on and I have to say they did an amazing job. The lines for the rides are pretty long on the weekends especially after 4 pm. Be aware that tickets have a discounted price after 4, which means a lot more people are there. So there is a pretty big crowd for the Halloween show in Magic Island. Make sure you hold your kids hands or you will lose them.

Also, you can rent some cute clothes/high school/uniforms to walk around and take pictures!! Overall, if you're a foreigner--make sure to google ticket discount and go see Lotte World!!

There are plenty of rides to suite all ages, but the outdoor rides in Magic Island are mostly for older kids over 130 or 140cm tall.

156,11,291,"We went in at 10 a.m. which was the opening time but there was already a long queue in front of entrance. Soooo many students since it was summer holidays.  We knew what we wanted to go for so ran to French revolution as soon as we entered. One of the most popular rides. We rode within 10 mins and went on to next one, Pirates ship, managed to ride within 15 mins.  We tactfully chose the rides with shorter queue and could ride many rides for the first few hours. It was possible because I am very familiar with rides and how to go about. If you are to come in in the afternoon, I strongly suggest 2 ways to shorten your queue time.  I am not talking about buying ridiculously expensive fast passes. Something you can do for free.  Lotte world uniquely offer 3 fast access using their own App. Magic pass App. Of course you will want to have more than 3 passes since there are many popular ones but better than nothing.  You first need to scan or manually register your entrance tickets on App. Press reserve ride. Each ride opens up every 15 mins to choose time slot. Within seconds, slots will be gone. It is difficult to explain here. Once you try to use App, you will get the hang of it soon.  If you are not very technical person or have slow finger, I would suggest another way. Know what you want to ride and go there. At each entrance of ride, you will see ticket reservation machine. Simply scan your ticket then it will give out next available time slot. Bring that paper at given time and go to fast pass way.  Only downside of this method is you need to physically go to ride and scan your tickets. If your 3 rides are all scattered around, you need to walk around so much. I suggest you to choose 3 rides relatively close to each other.  Atlantis, French revolution, pirates ship and gyro drop are the must-trys. There were 3 horror houses but I didn't try since my 2 kids were too scared to go in. The most popular one was at magic island which is outdoor. It's a shame that you need to pay 5000 won to go in.  There are many variety of restaurants to choose from. Korean, Japanese, Chinese and burgers...etc. Many stalls sell Lottel world goods and desserts.  Lotte world rides can entertain from toddlers to teenagers. They have more indoor rides than outdoor ones. Perfect for rainy days. We stayed until 4 p.m. and rode most of the rides using App and reservation machines. Without a plan, you could wait for hours for each ride so plan well ahead.",156,would
157,12,293,"Spent my birthday at Lotte World Adventure and I must say that this place exceeded my expectations. I was concerned that it would be more suitable for young children and whilst there are really a lot of rides and attractions catered towards a children and a younger audience, there were plenty of things for adults to entertain themselves with with as well.  Unfortunately, we went on a super wet and rainy day and could not try all the rides on the Magic Island (what they call the outdoor area) because they all closed once it started pouring. Thankfully there is a relatively large and pleasant indoor area but we had to queue for ages for the indoor rides.  My advice before going to Lotte World is to plan your visit well. Decide which rides or attractions you want to visit, and consider if its worth investing in the Magic Passes. We spent most of our day queueing and it can get quite frustrating to stand in lines for 50-60 minutes at a time. The Magic Passes would save time for sure but if I'm not mistaken, you still need to ""fight"" for certain ride slots. Do check that you aren't going on a public or school holiday in S. Korea and do avoid weekends. We went on a random Thursday - to our knowledge there were no holidays, but still the place was packed with school children and teenagers.  Another tip - don't miss the Folk Museum! It was actually a really impressive museum and we enjoyed exploring the exhibits.",157,would

My 6 year old was even too short for the swings! I don’t know if it was H&S but the sizes were strange. We could only go around the video rides, amusement arcades and a few of the street games. It looks like a magical place but we felt very flat. It feels like a cheaper version of Disney, even down to the red bow. It looses something with all the similarities, there are so many. I would have loved it to be more Korean. Street procession was like a Brazil carnival.  Queueing was 100 minutes for one ride and it was a very humid/rainy day which makes me think on a nicer day it could be worse.  One thing is guaranteed, this place will have you haemorrhaging money. We paid W198,000.00 (family of 4)and that was without the added extras like museum entrance. There are also things like “The Mirror Maze”, darts games and other attractions that will cost you extra, you can buy additional tickets next to the rides for these. It’s a very costly day.

I paid for 3 tickets on Kloop (ticket collection was far away from the main entrance... A good 10-15min walk after asking 3 different people) and added 5 magic passes to two of those tickets for an extra S$100. What a waste of money. The magic pass system is terrible. Every 15 minutes the system opens to allow time slots to be booked to reserve the ride and skip the queue. It has very limited number of time slots each hour and try as we might, for 2 hours we could not reserve anything. Each time the reservation started... It showed all slots filled/closed about 10 seconds after it opened. Eventually all time slots had been reserved and we had to queue with everyone else. So that was $100 down the drain. We didn't ride any of the popular rides because the queues were 90 to 110mins per ride. We were there for 10 hours (until closing time) and rode 5 rides all day. We thought... Screw it let's pay extra to play the VR games.... But no... There's a height restriction and my girl was 5cm below it.  Also, the stupid parade that they run through the main indoor Adventure land around 2pm will section off large areas which cannot be crossed easily or at all (during some parts of the parade). So don't get separated or you won't be able to return until after the parade ends. And all this online advice about going for the popular rides during the parade I found to be bull crap.... The queues were long and getting longer still...  While my 10yr old enjoyed it, as an adult - I wouldn't wish the experience on my worst enemy. Only a parents love for his kids got me through this day.  Just be prepared to queue. Bring your tunes and your headphones, battery pack for your phones, a portable fan (sweaty queues whether indoor or out), snacks, drinks, and pack light. There are plenty of lockers but they are single use so if you do use them then make sure you keep the important stuff with you. One thing I wish I had was a collapsible stool. You will stand for a long long time at Lotte World in queue after queue. I saw some parent bring a picnic mat for the kids to sit and lie on. She was a local with local knowledge.

No doubt the basic amenities such as toilets are well maintained, so they are clean and functional. Plenty of food stalls and restaurants spread out so one never runs out of options.  There are plenty of articles floating round on the tips so parents do read them, otherwise invest in Magic Pass Premium, download the Lotte World Adventure Magicpass app to enjoy a few rides with dedicated time slots. Of course, avoid peak season if you can!  Our children (7 and 1+) were enjoying themselves nevertheless, but the waiting time really did eat up most hours, not forgetting time for lunch/dinner and breaks. The number of rides/attractions are sufficient to keep the kids occupied enough that they can never finish all the rides.  The indoor theme park can be like a maze so parents need to read the map carefully while trying to match the ride timing so that one would not miss the parade. So it's not just an adventure for the kids/teens, but also quite another one for the parents!",172,would

For me the best thing was just seeing the indoors theme park and looking at cool things. The lines for most rides are pretty long. And one of the few things we did was go on a balloon that goes around the theme park in the roof. Which was pretty cool, but not worth waiting 90 minutes with a korean yelling/singing into a speaker constantly for every group going on a new balloon. The part with the games and stuff was okay but not great.",173,would

Mostly there are a lot of people that is why you should be quick-wittedness. We normally say we need to win on the quick-wittedness game which means that we need to go there when there are fewer people. Anyway, it would be good for you to enjoy Korea's amusement park.

Haha true enough, it was airconditioned, which was very helpful during Summer time. There were a lot of rides and entertainment there but we just didn’t have the time to experience it all.  We went inside the Fantasy Forest (if i remember it correctly), which btw, you would have to pay extra 2,000 KRW to enter, since our ticket didn’t mention that it was included. No worries though since my 2 year old son loved seeing the various animals that were inside.

I don't know about other countries, but in America, disneyland is so huge that it takes a whole day just to cover one section of the park. Compared to the disneyland in LA, lotte world is like 1/10 the size. It's just so tiny and the rides were not really ""thrilling"" at all. The horror house was literally a 10 minute 3D video for 5 year olds.

So if you’re below 110cm, you basically cannot take most of the rides even though if the kid is game for it. The kid would have to take the really baby rides.

Honestly, it's not a good amusement park. I would advise people to not go. I have not been to Everland, but surely it can't be worse. The only reason I can think that Lotte World is busy is that it is in the city centre area beside 3 or 4 big shopping malls, so I guess people who are around find it convenient to visit. But I can't imagine anyone going for more than 1 visit. And I don't recommend that anyone visit it even once.  The indoor part of Lotte World feels like a bunch of mediocre amusement park rides have been shoved into a shopping mall on 3-4 floors. Making matters worse, there is a bit of a bad smell around the space. We went on a few rides in the indoor part (a dinosaur shooting one and a flight simulator one) - they were somewhat copies of Disneyland rides, but not even 1/4 as good.  The outside area of Lotte World was not very big, connected via a bridge over the highway. There is a castle in the middle (copy of disneyland), and the main ""thrill"" rides seemed to be the rides that either go from side to side (like a ricking ship ride) or that spin. We didn't go in tot the haunted house as I read a review to avoid it. We went on a Monday and the wait for those average-looking ""thrill"" rides was 40 minutes. Those rides remind me of old-stlye travelling amusement parks that go to various cities with basic rides. Really there is not much more than that, from what we could see, at Lotte World.  It was a real letdown. We left very early.",196,would

They also had a parade at night which was pretty interesting. This place is pretty big so I would suggest making good use of the map and pick the places you would like to try and check out. I would also recommend checking different sites for tickets on sale. I went with my sisters & friends and what made this place fun was being able to hang out with friends enjoy different attractions together.

Really disappointing, also didn't help that the staff didn't speak a great deal of English, so when we did ask about the tickets they had said that it would cost nothing for our 2 year old and what we understood as we could go on 4 rides for free was actually he could go on those 4 rides for free if we buy the all inclusive ticket.

The park is good, but perhaps a little pricey for what it is. The rides are on the same scale as say Legoland. Don't expect anything that will leave you wanting to ride again. There are some food outlets which vary in quality. The high points are the water log ride, the Zombie VR area and the Korean Heritage area. There is a huge shopping mall attached which should suit every need. Annoyingly you would need a more expensive day pass to be able to enter the park, then leave to go shopping, then re-enter later on, even though it's all the same Lotte complex.

Arrive as close to opening time as you can to ensure short lines. If not happy about long lines, purchase a Magic Pass (a fair bit more expensive) that takes you to the front of the queue. Note that once queue's build up substantially - which they do - many of the rides close the expensive Magic Pass. In other words, get there the earlier the better. Weekends are terribly busy meaning long lines.  Lotte World truly caters for all ages (not necessarily those over 65 who Lotte World believe are too old to go on some of the rides!) with a myriad of toddler, child and adult rides.  Now to what really upsets me: You'd think that the entry fee would cover everything (aside from food etc of course). Well, it doesn't. Indeed, there are many areas requiring you to spend extra! Take the Ice Rink for example; it is completely autonomous to the adventure park, even though it is right in the middle of it.  You can have a great day at Lotte.

Accordingly, the lines for most of the rides were very long. For example, I waited over an hour to ride the French Revolution.  Surprisingly, one of the best things about this theme park was the Italian Restaurant. The Margherita Pizza (albeit expensive) was, quote possibly, the best pizza I have ever had in my life!

I can't imagine how the lines would be on a weekend. Everything was cute and catered for kids. There were adult rides as well, but we didn't go on them. There are lots of places to get food, and we ended up eating at their fancy Italian restaurant for lunch to celebrate. The food was delicious, and price was not too bad. At the top floor they have this area like the Alive Museum which was fun for everyone. The place was not too big so it wasn't overwhelming like Disneyland or Disneyworld.

If you go in the morning I highly suggest hitting the outside rides first, just because it's still cool outside and the lines will be relatively short. For those that have a waist line bigger than 32 inches, some rides might not be good for you just based on the fact that in Asia, many things, including roller coasters are built for smaller people. I am a larger woman, and i was able to ride the bumper cars, the spin guro, the hot air balloons, the carasole, and there were a few others that I opted out of that would be accommodating to larger people. Bring your own food. While there is food in the amusement park, and it is relatively cheap in comparison to parks in the U.S. it is still just amusement food. I ate at ""school food"" which has some good kimbap and ddeokbokki. If you have younger ones, or if you're not good with big crowds then definitely avoid the weekends where it gets pretty packed and the lines get lengthy (it was an hour for the hot air balloons).

I like that rides are of varying thrill levels, making it suitable for kids as well as thrill-seekers.

For those who want to escape from the summer heat will enjoy the fact that there are also many attractions in the indoor area. The rides are okay but some of the 3D shorting games was a tad disappointing. Avoid weekends and public holidays. We went on a weekday morning so it was relatively sane. We didn't need to wait long for the rides. By afternoon we se hordes of school kids there for their school trip. Time to leave.

219,74,691,I personally love Lotte World and expect to go there everytime I go to Seoul. I would recommend to spend the whole day here or you can go in after 4pm and have a discount. Check the weather really carefully because most of the awesome rides are outside The lines are super long if you go on the weekends. About 3 hours to the max. If you do not speak Korean and have a question just ask a staff. NOT a student. There are a lot of student who come for a school trip and they tend to get worried if you talk to them not because they think you're weird or anything. Most Korean people get all flustered if you speak with them. Try the snacks if you're willing to splurge. Try the VR French Revolution or the Haesung Tuk Gup. Its really fast and worth waiting for. You can also reserve you ride with an app. You can reserve up to three rides I believe. Also check the official site for special event discounts. For example if it were Halloween if you have three of the same letter in your name as Halloween you get a discount. Check the official site and bring your ID with you. If you are spending the whole day go as early as possible. People in Korea wait about two hours before opening. Don't do that unless you want the full experience.,219,would

I would suggest reaching Lotte World the moment it opens and going straight for the few rides you really want to go for first. Because the waiting times for some of the more exciting rides become 2 and a half hours later in the afternoon.

224,79,716,"Lotte World really IS the Korean version of Disneyland, and it has a lot of options to minimize the waiting. You can download the smart phone app (Lotte World Adventure), scan your tickets with your phone's camera, and reserve three Magic Passes (per ticket). It is mostly in English (just agree to the usual legalese in Korean to open). When you choose your ride, it will show you the next time available for the Magic Pass. Maps are available in many languages, so English-speakers can manage just fine.  There is an extensive selection of indoor attractions with additional rides outside. The castle and most of the thrill rides are outside. There was a nice balance between virtual rides that offer safe thrills (Fly Venture, Wild Valley, Wild Wing, etc.) and traditional rides like the log flume, several roller coaters, etc. Some hybrid rides like French Revolution were too much for me. We did this when it was cold and rainy, so the indoor location was perfect.  You can eat cheaply at the Lotteria (fast food burgers, chicken nuggets, etc,) or eat at a nice local-style restaurant. There is a variety to choose from with a broad range of prices. The shows are cute and popular, but be sure to check the times. Some only run twice a day, while other shows and parades run more frequently. Pick up the Times Guide.  If you still can't decide if it is a good fit for your family, review the rides and shows online (or in the free app) and see for yourself. We thought it was a bargain for all the fun we had. However, I would double-check to avoid Korean holidays if you don't like crowds.",224,would

It's half inside and half outside so that part was super cool. It was my first time seeing an amusement park inside. We ended up finding the ice cream shop. Since it's half inside you could go on a rainy day, but I would suggest going when you can enjoy both parts of the park. There are many rides that are copies of Disneyland so I would compare it to that. Not very thrilling, but everything was very cute. Couples everywhere. Must-go-to if you love amusement parks. We ate at the Lotteria outside before going into the park.",226,would
227,82,731,"If you have been to Disneyland and are expecting something similar then you will be disappointed. However, if you want to spend a day hanging out with your little ones, especially if the weather is bad, then Lotte World has plenty to offer you.  If you do decide to go then make sure you get a discount voucher (available from most hotel lobbies/concierge) - you will find that a 20 percent discount will be offered.  Getting to Lotte World is easy on the MRT. Take the green line and get off at Jamsil station. The MRT signs point you towards Exit 3 (if you go out this way the head towards Charlotte Theatre and you will see one of the entrances/ticket office). Another option will be to head towards Exit 4, but you don't have to leave the underground pedestrian footpath to get to the entrance/ticket office.  It's not obvious, as it doesn't stipulate in English, but a Day Pass ticket entitles you to 3 Fast Passes for rides (although I'm not sure if this applies for Half Day Passes?). There are a few kiosks scattered inside that allows you to chose which rides Fast Passes are available on (normally within 45 minutes and not beyond). Alternatively download the Lotte World app and register your entrance ticket details to access Fast Passes via your phone. I believe that if you can buy Fast Passes if you go beyond the complimentary 3 that come with your day pass ticket.  Once inside it the multi-level and indoor and outside areas require a certain amount of orienteering. Rule of thumb is that the outside area has the majority of the fast/big rides; whilst the inside has about 3 big rides, but mainly caters to the young audience. We went as a family of 4 (two little ones under 7 yrs old), went on most of the rides that the children could ride on (they are quite strict on height), arrived at 1130am and left at 8.30pm. Exhausted.  Lotte World tries hard to imitate Disneyland. There are parade shows and a fairytale castle, but ultimately the lack of recognisable characters (no Mickey and Minnie et al) make them unmemorable. So forget the unmemorable merchandising and just go for the rides.  Lotte World does not check your backpack/handbags so you are free to bring outside food and drink with you.  PS The cherry blossom has just come into season and there are a number of trees surrounding the outside area that make it more memorable than it would be otherwise.",227,would

The outdoor rides in magic island, were mostly for adults, In one of the rides we saw that there was a short queue in line so we asked one of the staff if we can go inside, the staff doesn't speak English well, so it was so hard to communicate, when we were about to turn our back because we do not understand what she was saying, she pulled us in the corner, and with few English words, she told us that she will help us go inside but we should be quiet about it and keep it as a secret. (I think that was what she meant ;) Then she gently pushed us inside When we got inside, there was still a queue in line but shorter, only to find out that the ride we got into (The Comet express) was not the ride we want to go to. It was like the roller coaster plus the seats rotates 360 degrees, we were sooo dizzy. We were hoping for a lighter ride but we were thankful to the staff( forgot her name), she did her best for us to experience the thrill..

Most of the park is indoors and was unpleasantly noisy as sound echoed off the walls. My 11 year old was forbidden to ride many of the ""kid"" rides because of her height, but as a parent (taller than my daughter) I was allowed to accompany my younger children. We love Korea, but this is a typical example of the rigid, nonsensical (to the American mind) rule-following that is commonplace here.

I don't think I need to describe how fun it is in the theme park since they are more or less the same seriously... yeah Lotte World makes you feel joyful and excited when you step in the indoor park, but for real, when you get closer to the ride and once you spot the end of the queue, and start lining up, and wait for 15 mins, and wait for 30 mins, still a long way to go, I am sure you will get mad.

There are parts of the park that were a obvious rip off of disneyland. Its located inside of a large shopping complex and right next to a hotel. Its a MUST visit for anyone with children, wanting to have fun on a business trip or just wanting to have something different to do. The Main rollercoaster is a BLAST, and would rival most coasters in any major park. The size of the park and all the things to see and do are amazing and well worth the coast of apprx. $65 per person to go in and ride the rides. you can purchase a $30 ticket but that won't allow you access to the rides.

Wait time said 80 minutes. I would estimate we waited for 2 hours before we got on the actual ride, which was vaguely Space-Mountain-ish and mildly entertaining, but certainly not worth the wait. It was hot, so we went back inside to try to find another ride. All the ""thrill"" (coaster-type) rides listed a 120 minutes wait, which probably meant 2.5 hours. We wandered around inside a bit more (it is pretty cool to look at - they cram so much inside, including people!) until we decided to bail. A complete waste of money. Tried to be Disney but failed in every way. Disinterested employees, rides with too little capacity, signs ineffective (no lie, it took us 25 minutes to find the way back out to the street!). If you must go, don't pay the all-inclusive ticket (48,000 won for adults, barely cheaper for kids), pay the cheaper ticket price, wander around and pay for rides as you go (supposedly you have this option), if you can actually get on any.",240,would

The whole place is terribly busy and designed poorly, you feel crampt even not waiting in a line. When your waiting in a line prepare for camping a couple of hours with most main rides taking at least 120min wait. The rides that didn't, are poor or average at best.  The eating areas were open right next to rides so prepare for a noisy experience when you want to relax for lunch. Like dining in a club.  Many attractions inside actually cost money, so when you see a big queue and head for the short queue, you find it costs ₩3000.  The staff were very rude and not fun. They didn't care about their customers and didn't have that fun land happy attitude I would expect from such a place.  All in all the place was dull... With crampt almost unfinished rendered corridors at parts with dull lighting it almost seemed like each area had its own budget and refused to fund the walkways between.  Honestly everything that fails at this place is a win at Everland. Some people say they hate the happy music and smiles of Everland, but a place like this should be that way and trust me happy cheerful smiles go a long way to make the scene.  A final note  Please, just accept these things and you will have a good time. If you go in expecting a diamond you won't find that, just be patient, get a snack for the queues and don't limit yourself to a short visit.",241,would

Restaurants, cafes and snack stalls/stores are widely available and you don't have to walk far until you come across the next one.  While everything is huge, impressive and contemporary, it seemed quite dull and lifeless to me. There were some nice things to see but the overall experience was just... boring to be honest. I'm sure it's different for kids, but there are theme parks that can excite even the dullest of adults.  We also found the price to be quite steep, the day pass was close to USD 50.00. Should you decide not to take any rides, their entry fee was still pretty hefty at USD 31.00 for a day.

The huge dome with its central skating ring and surrounding rides are an impressive sight. Having such a large park in the heart of a 25 million metropolis is amazing. However, Lotte World might not be your best option for entertainment in or around Seoul. Lotte World is straight up inferior to Everland ride-wise, with fewer rides, especially thrill rides such as roller coasters, which also means that each ride will be packed with quite a long line that can top an hour for the best rides. So if you're a roller coaster enthusiast, I recommend checking out Everland instead. In addition, the park is 25 years old and feels like it. It doesn't feel quite new, especially for outside attractions. The park's attractions and stores all have this ""slightly off"" color and design that didn't age all too well. Also, the Lotte World now fails in comparison to the building next door, the new 2nd Lotte World complex, which features numerous dining and shopping options, as well as what will soon become the tallest tower in the OCDE. Overall, I do recommend checking out the park and its surroundings, but would advise against staying there an entire day.

In fact, they will probably measure your kids and then slap a wrist band on them (similar to the type you get at the hospital), indicating the height of your child. There is no smooth talking any of the attendants, if your kid misses the height by an inch, that's it, they don't make it on the ride. 2. If you do not favor Korean food, they have hotdogs, corn dogs, a hamburger joint, and a pizza place. The pizza looked off, and we attempted to order 4 beef hamburgers for approx. 5 solid minutes, and we got everything from shrimp burgers to chicken patties on the tray. We ended up just taking the chicken patties, which were a little off. They came with mayo and teriyaki sauce on them. We didn't like them at all. The parking is easy to get to, but since Lotte World is in a busy part of the city, I would recommend the subway system. 3. You have to be 6 years or older to skate on the ice rink. We brought socks for everyone but decided not to go when we found out our 3 year old couldn't skate. 4. Once you leave Lotte World there is no reentry. We were looking smack dab at a TGIFs but couldn't get to it because we wouldn't be allowed back in. Bottom Line - GO FOR IT. It's definitely worth it. The lines were very short, usually waited about 10 minutes per ride. Go, have fun, we did!",261,would
262,117,927,"Looks great but were unfortunately disappointed, at first it looks really exciting and spectacularly decorated but the rides are quite basic. We experienced a situation here which never before has been experienced anywhere else in the world for us. Both me and the person I was travelling with suffer some medical problems which mean its better to go back to the hotel for a rest and to take medication, also wanted to look around the shops there and get something to eat. We asked when buying a day pass that we needed to do this and the person at the counter said it was fine. When we attempted to leave the staff refused to let us leave and said if we leave we wont be allowed back in unless we pay for another day pass. They were unprofessional and rude, and I was thinking it could be a language mistake. so after multiple questions we demanded to see someone who could speak English fluently, they confirmed this was the rule but this staff member was very friendly and arranged for us to be let in after we left, it was a ridiculous rule as ive been to theme parks all over the world and never not been let out before! Please keep in mind that this is an even more stupid rule because the indoor theme park is a part of a huge shopping complex, and outside the gates are multiple food courts and restaurants, inside the park is a very limited range of food or shops and is also more expensive. The whole complex is owned by Lotte aswell, so I dont know what the problem is in letting people out. It seemed most of the locals had yearly passes so were allowed to come and go as they pleased.  We first noticed on arrival that the staff were very unfriendly, and rude, some even look like life is so painful they would gladly be euthanized if given the option, this was quite disappointing as we came here to have a happy day out at the end of a long trip but ended up being quite downbeat due to their attitude and poor organisation. I was told that this was the Korean way though! Disneyland is the happiest place on earth for a reason and this place doesn't come close!  The park is very hard to find things, you can see a ride that looks interesting but walk around for hours looking for the entrance to it! Staff had no English skills mostly so wasn't any use to ask them. Signage was really bad, Especially bad that very little was in English as-well.  Most of the more exciting rides were closed for maintenance or had extremely long lines so we were forced to go on the less popular ones. The park is clearly a poor copy of a Disney park but it could be so much better with a little work. We were adults but also noticed there werent many rides for younger children, but the Sinbad ride was very good for all ages for people who dont like thrill rides but still want a little adventure with the drops and everything.  The Parades were disorganised but interesting to watch. I would recommend going to Lotteworld if its a less busy day and if you like theme parks, definitely wouldn't attempt going here on the weekend or a public holiday.  The guidebooks say to get off at a certain train station, but again theres no signage to LOTTEWorld, or any map or guide to say where it was or even where the entrance was, was very confusing and we got there later than expected due to this.  Unfortunately poor communication and organisation lets this park down in what could be a really amazing experience. Part of what I liked about it was that it was a theme park in a new country so a new experience.",262,would
263,118,952,"I'm a big fan of amusement parks in the states...unfortunately most Korean rides don't live up to the excitement and adrenaline rush the USofA has to offer, but it's a very nice amusement park nonetheless. Some pretty exciting rides, indoor and outdoor, good food (beer was available in the park when I went at dining areas) and if you go at a strategic time, you can ride most of the rides with little to no wait..  My first experience (2009), a group of foreign friends went very early on a Saturday morning (Korean students were in session that day for a half day). We got a 'foreigner discount' (I think this is very unfair) and as we were some of the first people in the park, we went up the escalator and found the entire mascot crew and marching band at the top preparing for their work day. They gave us an awesome tribute of 'Surfing USA'. They would've had no idea if we were Americans, Canadians, or otherwise, but I thought that was hilarious and a lot of fun.",263,would

Some of my friends couldn't ride on the Turbo Drop which according to me is the best ride in Lotte World. A few of us were the fortunate ones to take the last ride for the day on the same. All requests to take our friends on the said ride fell on deaf ears.  Both the roller-coasters were loads of fun.  I would definitely recommend a visit to Lotte World.

Mostly there are a lot of people that is why you should be quick-wittedness.

Specifically on the 13 Oct 2018 morning, the two Club Lounge staff had helped to find the nearest clinic for me upon request and followed up with me on their own accord an hour later if I was going to the clinic. Another special mention would be the male lobby senior staff who, upon my inquiry of direction, brought me to the clinic for fear I might find it difficult to locate.

If you rarely go to large theme parks, then you'll like lotte world. I really didnt like lotte world because it was so tiny that I could cover the entire amusement park in under 4 hours. I don't know about other countries, but in America, disneyland is so huge that it takes a whole day just to cover one section of the park. Compared to the disneyland in LA, lotte world is like 1/10 the size. It's just so tiny and the rides were not really ""thrilling"" at all. The horror house was literally a 10 minute 3D video for 5 year olds.

Don't spend money on the mini zoo (the animals are so poorly looked after) and be aware that some things will cost extra. We arrived early on a wet, overcast day which seemed to help as we had little to no wait time on most rides. As the day went on we could see wait times were massively increasing so would strongly recommend going early.

There are a variety of different roller coasters, crazy spin you upside down rides, just cruising ""slow paced"" rides, 3D attractions, A HAUNTED HOUSE (really liked this one), and lots of fun rides for the kids. They also had a parade at night which was pretty interesting. This place is pretty big so I would suggest making good use of the map and pick the places you would like to try and check out. I would also recommend checking different sites for tickets on sale. I went with my sisters & friends and what made this place fun was being able to hang out with friends enjoy different attractions together.

I can't imagine how the lines would be on a weekend. Everything was cute and catered for kids. There were adult rides as well, but we didn't go on them. There are lots of places to get food, and we ended up eating at their fancy Italian restaurant for lunch to celebrate. The food was delicious, and price was not too bad. At the top floor they have this area like the Alive Museum which was fun for everyone. The place was not too big so it wasn't overwhelming like Disneyland or Disneyworld.

From Myeongdong it takes less than an hour to travel to Jamsil station which is directly connected to the park. It's a huge place with indoor and outdoor area. For those who want to escape from the summer heat will enjoy the fact that there are also many attractions in the indoor area. The rides are okay but some of the 3D shorting games was a tad disappointing. Avoid weekends and public holidays. We went on a weekday morning so it was relatively sane. We didn't need to wait long for the rides. By afternoon we se hordes of school kids there for their school trip. Time to leave.

284,139,1153,I personally love Lotte World and expect to go there everytime I go to Seoul. I would recommend to spend the whole day here or you can go in after 4pm and have a discount. Check the weather really carefully because most of the awesome rides are outside The lines are super long if you go on the weekends. About 3 hours to the max. If you do not speak Korean and have a question just ask a staff. NOT a student. There are a lot of student who come for a school trip and they tend to get worried if you talk to them not because they think you're weird or anything. Most Korean people get all flustered if you speak with them. Try the snacks if you're willing to splurge. Try the VR French Revolution or the Haesung Tuk Gup. Its really fast and worth waiting for. You can also reserve you ride with an app. You can reserve up to three rides I believe. Also check the official site for special event discounts. For example if it were Halloween if you have three of the same letter in your name as Halloween you get a discount. Check the official site and bring your ID with you. If you are spending the whole day go as early as possible. People in Korea wait about two hours before opening. Don't do that unless you want the full experience.,284,would

On average I think I spent about 1 and a half hour queuing for each ride. The queues can be quite painful, but the rides were well worth the queue. I would suggest reaching Lotte World the moment it opens and going straight for the few rides you really want to go for first. Because the waiting times for some of the more exciting rides become 2 and a half hours later in the afternoon. There are many restaurants in the theme park too and they are surprisingly not expensive. Also, weather is not really an issue since most of the rides are indoors! Overall, I had a great day there.

It's half inside and half outside so that part was super cool. It was my first time seeing an amusement park inside. We ended up finding the ice cream shop. Since it's half inside you could go on a rainy day, but I would suggest going when you can enjoy both parts of the park.

I don't think I need to describe how fun it is in the theme park since they are more or less the same seriously... yeah Lotte World makes you feel joyful and excited when you step in the indoor park, but for real, when you get closer to the ride and once you spot the end of the queue, and start lining up, and wait for 15 mins, and wait for 30 mins, still a long way to go, I am sure you will get mad. (I was with my boyfriend and we were getting more tired and even stopped talking...)  I strongly suggest my fellow travellers, try to avoid visit Lotte World on Friday/Saturday/Sunday!!!!!  My first visit to Lotte World back in 2014, I paid full-price and only spent 4 hours there becasue I was so fed up with the queuing.

There were long line on the most popular rides, but because we went during the MERS scare, the lines were pretty short anywhere else.

There is a small ""alive"" museum in the park, where you can take fun pictures that are optical illusions.

Proximity wise it is along the Han river beyond ApkuJongDong (on the same side as Gangnam) and near the Olympic park area. I wouldn't necessary stay at the Lotte hotel attached as per my memory rooms were small and beds tiny. Better to stay near Coex at Park Hyatt if not then Intercontinental or further out at Grand Hyatt.  Lotte World has been around for many years and this review is mainly for the indoor adventure park which is attached to a huge shopping mall. Across the street (intersection) is the Lotte new world mall; the tallest building.  We were able to get discounted tickets for free use of the park for just about 20,000 won each (around 20 US) by using certain promotional related approved credit cards that relied mostly on LG or other card. You can check with the staff there but basically my Korean host paid for it and I chipped in.  On the lowest level is an ice skating rink. On the above levels around it is the adventure park and also folk village (separate entry). Once we paid for our tickets into the park we ate at one of restaurants around the upper level of the rink; found a small buffet called Seven springs which was decent. We then entered the park and spent a nice afternoon watching live performances (there were many and Xmas themed). It made us feel very cheerful for the holiday and the performances were impressive and festive. Especially rock n roll santa Elvis! There was a small gallery within the park that was enjoyable for photos. We did not ride many rides and the monorail we did ride seemed dated. There is an outdoor portion the park but it was too cold to go outside. The mirror maze was fun but a few extra Won just for that attraction. All other attractions were free per our entrance fee. This can be a low-key enjoyable family event and can't comment on if I would just go for the rides there because that's just not my cup of tea. There does seem to be a VR roller coaster (coaster updated with VR googles), various on top of water rides like indoor jungle boat and flume. There's an indoor kids play area which was too packed to stand in line for. The 'balloon' ride circling the park seemed like a very scenic and slow ride more so than monorail. The park has two main characters Lotte and Lorry and they are cute and the concessions cheap enough to wear and have fun with.  The folk village is nice to have nearby for folks who want a taste of Korea and history. For a real taste of Korean history go to Geongbokgung to walk the palace grounds and museum and nearby Insadong to buy souvenirs and tea.  Lotte mall lower level has a food court option I think Hyundai dept stores have more impressive food courts. The mall itself is affordable to expensive depending on what you are looking for.

We hit all but like 2 rides that those under 100cm could do and we were there nearly all day. We went on a Monday and I think our longest line was MAYBE 10 minutes. We were disappointed that the playground in the Kids Zone was close. It would have been nice to have known that before. We of course had a short tantrum.

It was very attractive once the lift door was opened.  Best of all, the staffs of Lotte World Hotel were so friendly and helpful, especially the staff of concierge. Not just giving us very warm greeting whenever we passed by while we were staying for the whole day in the hotel due to the heavy rain, but also giving us excellent advise and brilliant idea of visiting the local Korea culture that we could not even found that from any travel guide book.

310,165,1351,"Lotte world is one of my favorite attractions in Korea. I would highly recommend this place if you want to make some great memories. It's a place for both children and adults. Try to reach lotte world as early as possible in the morning around its opening time. It would be less crowded then. Keep the information guide map handy all the time. It will help you a lot covering attractions more efficiently. As soon as we reached lotte world, we rushed to the roller coaster French Revolution which is on the 2nd floor. In the morning time the waiting queue is small. So, if you want to avoid long queues I would suggest you to grab the opportunity asap. I simply loved this indoor roller coaster ride. It was thrilling as well as super fun. Next, we made a clever strategy and decided to cover the attractions in top to down fashion starting from the 4th floor all the way down to the underland B1 floor. I think that helped a bit avoiding long queues and we could cover our desired attractions quickly. Don't forget to visit the Wild 4D shows wind, valley and jungle in underland B1 floor. It's a super amazing experience. The best among the all was wild wind. And you can skip the other two. After covering all the floors, we next moved on to the Magic land which is outdoor. It also has many thrilling outdoor rides. My favorite of all is Atlantis roller coaster. DO NOT miss this ride if you want to experience a real thrill. Waiting queue is too long but it's worth the wait. My next favorite in the magic land was comet express with rolling chairs. I came out laughing and it was pretty amazing. I truly dont feel that one day is enough to cover all the attractions in lotte world. As per the meals are concerned, we carried our own homemade food for lunch. There are also many and a great variety of restaurants out there. For vegetarians like me, there is a restaurant named ""Lake Pizza"" in the magic land which serves New York style pizza and its super yummy. Do plan a full day tour and avoid rainy days and weekends if possible. Also, avoid going in winter season as many outdoor rides are closed. Don't waste too much time clicking photographs as you might miss some super fun rides out there. Trust me, one day is just not enough. Good luck and have fun!!! :)",310,would

The perk of having Korean Nationals as friends, they knew the best time to go. Stay hydrated summer and winter. I'm from Florida and the summers there are much milder. You probably wouldn't die of heatstroke like at Disney, still hydrate. This place is a definite must do.",313,would

Love the ice skating ring, hot air balloon ride, parade, 4D ride, the charles chaplin performer, the pork cutlet cold buckwheat noodle at Mr Pork restaurant and carousel ride that have appeared in many Korean dramas.  I thought there maybe some areas that the theme park can improve. First, I think most tourists would agree with me the theme park needs a revamp. The rides are fun but they look old and they have served a decade of fun loving kids. Second, it's hard to find stairs and escalators that can lead us to the next floor. The map and direction weren't that useful. Third, rides narration and staff that gave safety instructions speak Korean, so we may have missed certain instructions or stories. It maybe good if they can add more English staff on ground or rides narration in English.  I would love to visit the theme park again and hopefully get to see these improvements.",319,would

We went on a random Friday in October thinking that it would not be packed, but my husband and I were shocked to see the amount of Korean teenagers there in the middle of the school day. The queues for the best rides were HOURS, and the Lotte Magic Pass system only worked every 2 hours. By noon all of the Magic Pass reservations were closed, which was discouraging because if we would have stood in line for the estimated queue times for all the big rides, we would have been waiting until midnight. We came rather early (around 10:30) and already it was a mad house. I definitely felt like I wasted my last day in Seoul at Lotte World.",321,would

Pretty cool to see the inside with the multiple floors - the largest indoor theme park in the world! The outdoor area is also really nice. Some rides we really liked were the: balloon ride, french revolution and Atlantis (pharaohs fury was unfortunately closed, and the flume ride was too long of a wait)! Probably wouldn't have come if we had to pay full price, but had a great time.  Also: with your ticket you get free entrance into the folk museum on the 3rd floor!

Love taking photos 4. Enjoy ticking off first / biggest sort of places in your travel list and/or 5. Want to go ice skating in summer  I'm biased as I enjoyed going here partly because I've seen it in lots of kdramas. This is where we first tried korean fried chicken (Lotteria) & enjoyed eating against a colourful backdrop of balloons & stuff. The parade was also nice & fun.

Thought the chance to walk around for 17,000 won would make it worthwhile for my first visit, but this is a poor date location. Lotte World was mobbed with middle-school students in their school uniforms taking selfie pictures with every attraction in site. Lines were long even late in the evening, and the indoor section of the park closed down completely from 8:25-9:10 for a ""parade"", which was pretty lame.  Lotte World is pretty old and not that large, though conveniently located in the middle of Gangnam, so considering the value of the land it sits on the park is a reasonable size. The few rides we took (without the long lines) were quite basic... shooting some dragons, a 3D haunted-house movie, and a balloon IMAX movie that my girlfriend found entirely disappointing ... not the balloon simulation that she was expecting. Anything worth riding had a 20-30 minute queue, and just about every line was closed by around 9:30pm, so you just don't get to try anything with the late admission ticket.  For 2 adult visitors, Lotte World was very underwhelming. Avoid.",328,would

The place offers a very good number of restaurants inside. It is also the first time I saw a theme park maximize its space by offering attractions from the basement to the 4 floors it occupies, then to the ceiling! A major drawback is that the place only uses Korean in all of its rides and attractions. It would really help a lot if the stories during the rides have at least written translations in English, Chines, and Japanese.  If you have been to the major theme parks around the world, then there is nothing new here, still it is worth visiting if you have kids and in Seoul.",330,would

It just simple family fun for a day but besides the food being bland, I have to credit to the healthy foods like the smoothie king. It tasted great. But regarding the park itself, its just worth a visit to experience a large indoor amusement park. But would not go back. One experience is enough. Another drawback is that some parts of the park still had payment needed like the mirror maze. The skating rink is not part of your ticket and if you want to go ice skating, you get out of the park but can't get back in. One plus are the toilets. Very clean.

Partly because he wanted to go because he loves amusement parks, but partly because he also wanted to show us the madness that is Lotte World. As I said, I wasn't sure what to expect, so the closest thing I can describe it to is Camp Snoopy/Nickelodeon World at the Mall of America in Bloomington, MN--except that Lotte World has both indoor and outdoor attractions, whereas CS/NW is purely indoors. The place was PACKED--I think we were there during a school break week--and the line for every ride was at least 3 hours long, so I didn't ride anything but instead just walked around (my dad and brother went on one ride while I sat and read a book, drank a soda, etc.). I can see how this would be entertaining for families/children who live in Seoul and this is as close to Disney as they can get. All of the rides and characters were blatant ripoffs of Disney characters/attractions, but that just added to the kitsch factor, so I was entertained by it all.  It was easy to find, easy to buy tickets, plenty of beverage/food options in the park. Just don't expect to be blown away if you have been to Disney Land/World already...it's not the same.

The price of admission was fair, about $25 per adult if I remember correctly. GET A MAP - this place has so many levels and rides everywhere it would be easy to miss something without getting a free map at the info desk.  We didn't get to go on too many rides as waits were were up to 2 hours on some of them. The ones we did visit were great! Well worth the money just to see the largest indoor amusement park in the world.

It looks great in photos but not so great once you are on it. It is very busy during the weekend.  The rink is on the lowest level and is best accessed from Lotte Mall. The staff at the admission booths usually have poor English so will misdirect you unintentional. The rink size is find. Large oval shape with many entries from seating area for skaters which is separated from the non-skater seatings. The rink is divided into three sections with cones. This is well done with the outer ring for beginners and general public skating, the secondary ring for skilled skaters and speed skaters. The inner most section is for learn to skate classes only. The quality of the ice rink is okay. The outer ring is heavily used and even after resurfacing, it still retains that bumpiness. The secondary ring, is smoother and nicer to skate on but all has a few bumps in it. We were not in the inner section so cannot tell its surface quality. The surface is quite a disappointment for skilled skaters. The ice is soft and wet after resurfacing. I think having a zamboni to resurface the ice would be remove the bumpiness but not the wetness.  The rink has many restrictive rules that are not clear on their website. Here are some examples.  - Children under the age of 6 are not permitted on the rink, not necessary true. What they really mean is children 120cm (3'11"") are not permitted on the ice at anytime. - Children ages 7 must be accompanied by an adult. They really mean a child age 7 must have an adult with them whether s/he is a beginner or skilled skater. The one child per adult is permitted, but 2 or more children with one adult is not permitted. - Hockey skates are not permitted at anytime. What they mean is they won't allow any hockey skates on the ice to keep the skating speed lower. So you can bring your own figure skates or speed skates to use along with gloves or mitts. If you don't have skates you can rent them there. The gloves and mitts is to ensure less bumps on the ice from beginners falling down and touching the ice. Children all have to wear a helmet which is free to use and are in two large bins in the changing area. If you forget to bring gloves or mitts, you can purchase some from the skate sharpening shop.

353,208,1621,"Had a spare afternoon on a chilly Seoul afternoon, so my girlfriend and I checked out Lotte World and had a ball. I didn't know what to expect from the place (thought it would be a cheap Disneyland knock off), but had a great time on the indoor roller coaster and other indoor rides (flume ride, adventure rides) as well as the big rides out on the island.  So if you do have a spare 5 hours and are in the mood for some good old fashioned amusement park fun, Lotte world is worth a look.",353,would
354,209,1624,"OK, this may sound a bit childish, but this is actually one of favorite places in Seoul. This place is hilarious. It makes you feel as if you've gone back to your childhood. Here are the tips and what I think about this place in general:  1. Make sure you visit during the parade time. Beautiful people in fancy costumes will parade in the tune of cheerful music and that is quite something to see.  2. If you enjoy skating, there is a ice skating rink in the middle.  3. The foods and beverages sold inside are of OK quality, and are reasonably priced. If you opt for better food, you would have to go out (but still inside the building and right outside the indoor entrance) and look for ""Spaghettia"" -- my favorite past franchise.  4. Lotte World is connected to Sukchon Lake where you can take a walk, Lotte Dept Store, Lotte Hotel, Lotte Mart and Lotte Cinema. There are also a big Apple Computer Shop and ToysAreUs, which add fun.  Enjoy!",354,would

There were more smaller rides and these were quicker to get on with queues of thirty minutes by midday. Lots of food choice. Toilets were reasonably clean. We saw two parades, one during the afternoon and one just before closing. Both of which were excellent. Staff were all cheerful and polite. They all spoke some degree of English.

375,20,248,My 2 teens asked to visit an amusement park. Wanted to visit Everland but was quite a distance. Decided to visit some place nearer to our hotel. Took a cab there and thought that the driver had sent us to the wrong place as we are not aware that the entrance is at the basement. Unlike Disneyland. Went in and there was a long queue to purchase the tickets. There were many students. Luckily the queue proceeded smoothly and fast. Bought the tickets to the park and folk museum. Did not go to the museum so we wasted on that. Spent about 3 hours as there weren’t many rides that appealed to my teens. We bought the so called fastpass in the park so my teens need not queue up. The place was alright but not as good as Disneyland. Need a bit of refurbishment though.,375,hour
376,21,250,"Visited with my three kids. More crowded than Hong Kong’s MTR Subway during peak hour. Unreal. They should have a concept of crowd control. Too many people no exaggeration.  A basic swing ride took a wait of 1 hour 40 mins (quoted a 1 hour wait which was already unreasonable for the ride) - 3 minute ride.  Will never visit ever again even if I was paid  If they employed a maximum occupancy limit, it would have been a fun day for the kids. Instead wasted one out of five of our days in Seoul.  Will be disputing my credit card charge for this one to say the least. Left after the one and only ride.",376,hour
377,22,256,"So we decided to book a ticket to lotte world during our vacation to Seoul, but I was really disappointed about the park. Having been to Disneylands, I would say lotte world is not even close to being as good as Disneyland. I was hyped at first at the entrance, wondering about the fun rides the park is going to offer but eventually i was greeted with disappointment when i took a look at the park map. Basically, the only fun ride was the Atlantis roller coaster and nothing else is that good. Plus, the place was packed with local students and I had to queue for 3 hours just for the Atlantis ride and trust me it wasn't pleasant at all. By the time we completed the ride, it was already evening. I would say they're trying to emulate disneyland with the castle and stuffs but boy was i wrong, as it wasn't even a ""fun"" experience at all. Rides were below average, some places were not covered with the 1 day pass and of course the massive crowd. I don't blame the crowd, but rather how small the park is to accommodate the large crowd.",377,hour
378,23,258,Visited on Tue 17 December 2019. Waited 1.5 hour for French Revolution VR. They should remove VR when it is not VR. Should have gotten the magic pass for this.

379,24,272,"If using the train, go to the Jamsil Station. You can get to Lotte world without going outside, there is a connection underground. I have been to many amusement parks, and I would not say that this has the best rides but I would say that it was a really fun environment and a fun place for kids and for friends just walking around and going on rides. They do have some really awesome rides for adults, but I don't think the adults will be doing the hair and dress up to be a princess for the day. Especially when all the dresses are kids sizes. They have parades and showtimes which are great. Right now they still have the Halloween decorations up in the Halloween shows going on and I have to say they did an amazing job. The lines for the rides are pretty long on the weekends especially after 4 pm. Be aware that tickets have a discounted price after 4, which means a lot more people are there. So there is a pretty big crowd for the Halloween show in Magic Island. Make sure you hold your kids hands or you will lose them. After 4, it is also common for lines on rides to run an hour to 150 minutes for wait time. No exaggeration.",379,hour
380,25,274,"If you’re thinking of visiting this park - DON’T!  Absolutely terrible theme park!! I was so excited before for this theme park as it kept appearing in Korean variety shows, but it is SO FAR OFF from my expectations now the only emotion i have left for it is pure disgust.  This park is a completely waste of time - the rides are old, trashy and not very well maintained. We waited 120mins to go on a ride called ‘French Revolution’ but in return all we got was a massive headache from our heads banging on the seats, and spent 15mins recovering from that.  A limited options of food and the taste is also not that great. The castle is extremely small, and here comes the worst attraction in the park - Ghost House. This attraction is such a joke, still left us traumatised. We waited an hour in line (when we still had hope for the park) for this horrendous attraction, and I felt my head was filled with crap after sitting down and basically watched a badly animated short-film when the protagonist - the cat, realised that he is not a real cat, but a ghost cat. Hence, even though we got there at approx 11am, we left at 4ish because we felt like we were ruining our mood by keep staying in the park despite the fact that we didn’t want to waste our money.  And lastly, if you’ve been to Disneyland or Universal studios theme parks and you’re used to their standards, don’t waste your time and money at Lotte World. Seriously. There are a lot more other fun stuff to do in Seoul and Lotte is definitely not one of them.",380,hour
381,26,291,"We went in at 10 a.m. which was the opening time but there was already a long queue in front of entrance. Soooo many students since it was summer holidays.  We knew what we wanted to go for so ran to French revolution as soon as we entered. One of the most popular rides. We rode within 10 mins and went on to next one, Pirates ship, managed to ride within 15 mins.  We tactfully chose the rides with shorter queue and could ride many rides for the first few hours. It was possible because I am very familiar with rides and how to go about. If you are to come in in the afternoon, I strongly suggest 2 ways to shorten your queue time.  I am not talking about buying ridiculously expensive fast passes. Something you can do for free.  Lotte world uniquely offer 3 fast access using their own App. Magic pass App. Of course you will want to have more than 3 passes since there are many popular ones but better than nothing.  You first need to scan or manually register your entrance tickets on App. Press reserve ride. Each ride opens up every 15 mins to choose time slot. Within seconds, slots will be gone. It is difficult to explain here. Once you try to use App, you will get the hang of it soon.  If you are not very technical person or have slow finger, I would suggest another way. Know what you want to ride and go there. At each entrance of ride, you will see ticket reservation machine. Simply scan your ticket then it will give out next available time slot. Bring that paper at given time and go to fast pass way.  Only downside of this method is you need to physically go to ride and scan your tickets. If your 3 rides are all scattered around, you need to walk around so much. I suggest you to choose 3 rides relatively close to each other.  Atlantis, French revolution, pirates ship and gyro drop are the must-trys. There were 3 horror houses but I didn't try since my 2 kids were too scared to go in. The most popular one was at magic island which is outdoor. It's a shame that you need to pay 5000 won to go in.  There are many variety of restaurants to choose from. Korean, Japanese, Chinese and burgers...etc. Many stalls sell Lottel world goods and desserts.  Lotte world rides can entertain from toddlers to teenagers. They have more indoor rides than outdoor ones. Perfect for rainy days. We stayed until 4 p.m. and rode most of the rides using App and reservation machines. Without a plan, you could wait for hours for each ride so plan well ahead.",381,hour
382,27,292,Too many people. Each ride need to queue up for at least 2 hours. Never go again. The theme park is very old.,382,hour

We just walked around, take photos..Quite boring if youre already there but unable to play..They have a mall for you to shop too but again, due to time constraint we were unable to walk around and shop. So if you plan to come here, please ensure youre not in a tour group and do not go during peak season as time will be wasted in queuing up for the rides as it will get really crowded",383,hour

Young children, in particular, would love it here as it's really catered for them.

The food in the Club Lounge was fresh and delicious, and there are no flaws except that there are two kinds of beer in the Happy hour time. The club lounge breakfast was a good combination of Korean food and other foods, and the omelettes in the live session are a pleasure to watch and eat, so I recommend you to experience it.

387,32,323,"We went on a Friday after Memorial day holiday in Seoul. May have been the most stupid time to go other than memorial day itself.  I paid for 3 tickets on Kloop (ticket collection was far away from the main entrance... A good 10-15min walk after asking 3 different people) and added 5 magic passes to two of those tickets for an extra S$100. What a waste of money. The magic pass system is terrible. Every 15 minutes the system opens to allow time slots to be booked to reserve the ride and skip the queue. It has very limited number of time slots each hour and try as we might, for 2 hours we could not reserve anything. Each time the reservation started... It showed all slots filled/closed about 10 seconds after it opened. Eventually all time slots had been reserved and we had to queue with everyone else. So that was $100 down the drain. We didn't ride any of the popular rides because the queues were 90 to 110mins per ride. We were there for 10 hours (until closing time) and rode 5 rides all day. We thought... Screw it let's pay extra to play the VR games.... But no... There's a height restriction and my girl was 5cm below it.  Also, the stupid parade that they run through the main indoor Adventure land around 2pm will section off large areas which cannot be crossed easily or at all (during some parts of the parade). So don't get separated or you won't be able to return until after the parade ends. And all this online advice about going for the popular rides during the parade I found to be bull crap.... The queues were long and getting longer still...  While my 10yr old enjoyed it, as an adult - I wouldn't wish the experience on my worst enemy. Only a parents love for his kids got me through this day.  Just be prepared to queue. Bring your tunes and your headphones, battery pack for your phones, a portable fan (sweaty queues whether indoor or out), snacks, drinks, and pack light. There are plenty of lockers but they are single use so if you do use them then make sure you keep the important stuff with you. One thing I wish I had was a collapsible stool. You will stand for a long long time at Lotte World in queue after queue. I saw some parent bring a picnic mat for the kids to sit and lie on. She was a local with local knowledge.  Food and beverage prices are not super expensive but nor are they cheap. Expect to pay amusement park prices.  I wish I could say something nice about Lotte World but I can't. I just taste bitterness.",387,hour

The Horror House had a long line of people and we waited for almost an hour. We were given 3D glasses as we entered. The design of the viewing room was okay but when the show began, I realized that it truly wasn't worth the wait.  The poor content of the 3D show was disappointing. I slept throughout the rest of the viewing time. The effects were way below my expectations and the absence of a good story frustrated me no end.  If only I could tell the people outside that they have to look for another attraction, I could have done it so.  Well, the administrators of this theme park have to give this a quick response.",388,hour

No real crowds, maybe some most popular adult rides had ~15 minute lines, but we breezed through it without spending more than 5 minutes in a line. Looks like most of the visitors are local young adults, so kid-focused areas didn't look busy.  Lots of fun to have for all ages. Only few rides were available for toddlers, but it was quite enough for us. Also keeping in mind just the fun value of exploring all the territory, plus a little musical play they perform, it all comes down to at the very least 2 hours of activities enough to exhaust your kid.  One big minus and -1 for the number of activities which require extra cost. Didn't use any of them out of principle, so don't know if they are worth it or not... But entry fee is high enough, I'd rather pay extra $5 and not be annoyed when stumbling into some random place only to be met with ""sorry, this costs extra"".

All in all we miss-judge available time & missed alot but still have and amazing fun tale to tell. Really it was very cool very wow !

395,40,356,"If one read most if not all of the reviews, you will find a few common themes: crowded, long queue, long waiting hours...... we experienced more or less the same. Looking at it at another perspective, I find this location a very popular spot for locals especially students and kindergartens. No doubt the basic amenities such as toilets are well maintained, so they are clean and functional. Plenty of food stalls and restaurants spread out so one never runs out of options.  There are plenty of articles floating round on the tips so parents do read them, otherwise invest in Magic Pass Premium, download the Lotte World Adventure Magicpass app to enjoy a few rides with dedicated time slots. Of course, avoid peak season if you can!  Our children (7 and 1+) were enjoying themselves nevertheless, but the waiting time really did eat up most hours, not forgetting time for lunch/dinner and breaks. The number of rides/attractions are sufficient to keep the kids occupied enough that they can never finish all the rides.  The indoor theme park can be like a maze so parents need to read the map carefully while trying to match the ride timing so that one would not miss the parade. So it's not just an adventure for the kids/teens, but also quite another one for the parents!",395,hour

We only knew about it at 11am and most of the rides were fully booked for all the slots. Managed to book the pharaoh which was somewhat a fun ride. It’s called the magic pass reservation. Be sure to reserve magic pass for the more trilling rides after getting your tickets! We waited for the French Revolution for a whooping 3.5hours. The ride lasted less than a minute, and VR was working. Not the best experience. Never going again. You will see the longest queue in your life. Went there at 930am left at 8pm.

The queuing time was ridiculous - over a hour unless you have a magic pass. The signs for the rides or the facilities are not clear. I walked a full circle looking for the toilets to discover it was right where I was. The stairs and escalators were hard to find going up or down a floor. Some experiences you have to pay extra for and you don't know this unless you go up to it like the VR experience on B3. They had a tour pamphlet all in Korean with the ice rink in it and we thought it was part of Lotte World. The park staff on B3, with very poor English, so I think she said, we'll be exiting the park and reentry is not permitted. So to sum up. Spent most of my time going around a big circle looking for stairs and elevators to go up or down a floor to go around in a circle to look for rides and experiences which takes a hour of queuing because people with magic passes takes priority so they take up the seats first.",401,hour

Best to arrive first thing when the crowds are small and queues are short - go to the most popular rides first - Atlantis, French Revolution, Pharaoh’s Rage etc. otherwise be prepared to queue for up to 2 hours when the crowd builds up especially in the holiday season.  The park is clean and well presented and offers a Disney-eque feel complete with their own Snow White Castle.  The entry ticket (we got 20% off using MasterCard) is generally all inclusive (a small handful of rides require extra payment). There is a range of food from local to western. Prices are generally higher than outside.

Another special mention would be the male lobby senior staff who, upon my inquiry of direction, brought me to the clinic for fear I might find it difficult to locate.  Very thankful for the concern and dedication of the hotel staff during my visit to Korea this time. Grateful to have made the acquaintance of the hotel staff.  Regards Room 3002 Guest (8 to 18 Oct 2018)",407,hour
408,53,423,"We visited the park on a Saturday and it was very crowded and busy .. without fast pass, we had to queue about an hour for each ride. We gave up after two rides , and went shopping at the lotte supermarket instead !",408,hour
409,54,426,"Was really disappointed with this. It looks good but that's about it. All the rides indoors are for young children, despite waiting in lines for 30 mins filled with teens and adults. The outside rides are proper rides but a 2 min ride doesn't really seem worth lining up half an hour. For tourists, if you have limited time I wouldn't recommend this, English is also a bit limited here.",409,hour
410,55,441,"Besides waiting 2.5 hours in a line up for a roller coaster wearing virtual reality goggles, the first thing we did getting off the ride was get back in line for a further 3 hours to do it again. It was a memorable time but allow yourself a full day.",410,hour
411,56,442,"This place provided for a fun day for our family. The key is to get the “Free Pass” ( Premium Pass ). This allows you to cut to the front of the line and, unlike the Magic Pass, it is unlimited and there is no need to make reservations using the app. At 100,000 Won it is not cheap, so we purchased just for the kids— they are now raving about Lotte World. Otherwise, I think the long lines (hour or more at times) would have seriously interfered with the fun.  It is also a good idea to get to Lotte World early as the atmosphere is calmer and not as crowded.",411,hour
412,57,456,"The mall has everything you need and big shops, also a cinema. With the biggest display in the world. But the price for parking and the parking situation on busy days is ridiculous and a poor statement. Also the food market is on busy days too full. With the good restaurants you have to wait an hour.",412,hour
413,58,460,This was a great place to take our kids 9 & 13. There’s 4 floors of rides and games. There’s also a lot of fun thrilling rides outside the building that kids and adults will have fun on. We spent about 8 hours here just playing games and ice skating.,413,hour
414,59,470,"I don't know why people say the queues are so bad they could hardly ride!  We went early in the morning and went on the French Revolution twice without queuing for more than 5 mins (bad idea cos one can get really dizzy on that ride)  I recommend going for Atlantis for your first ride as that ride is by far the most popular. Queue was 40 min or so but if you buy the magic pass from klook you can breeze straight to the front and beat the queue. If you wish, you can use all your magic passes here (prob the best cos the other queues are not as long as this)  We bought 5 magic passes. We went on every single ride, French Revolution 3x, Atlantis 3 or 4x, gyro spin, swing, drop a couple of times, Conquistador 4x.  If you download the app you can get some free magic passes (these are timed and released every hour) and you could use these for the less popular rides. We never managed to use the free app magic passes for the popular ones cos they were always sold out so we gave up.  Enjoy yourselves! The queues are not that bad! But please go early!",414,hour
415,60,484,"I read couple reviews before going and I kept asking myself what would people do there for so many hours. I know now, after leaving when 11th hour passed.  This spot just keeps throwing fun at you and it won't stop.  Ticket price is about 50k won per adult, but what you get inside makes up for the price.",415,hour
416,61,488,"We came here late Thursday morning and there was almost no queue at all the rides. Think the crowd came in about 2pm or so, however queue length is still relatively ok at 30-40mins.  Generally the indoor parts are for kids and outdoor rides are more older kids or adults.  We bought our tickets from the internet and managed to cut the ticket queue, however we still need to exchange for real tickets at the South Gate, and only there. Signage was quite bad and it took us about 15-20 mins to locate it.  Within the theme park, again signage can be improved as we find ourselves circling around look for the specific rides.  All in all, it was still fun enough for us to go around without lunch for 8 hours.  Cannot be compared to Disney or universal studios but good enough for us.",416,hour
417,62,489,"Ok if you're from the US like I am and are used to going to big theme parks like Universal studios, six flags, and disneyland, then you're going to be disappointed. If you rarely go to large theme parks, then you'll like lotte world. I really didnt like lotte world because it was so tiny that I could cover the entire amusement park in under 4 hours. I don't know about other countries, but in America, disneyland is so huge that it takes a whole day just to cover one section of the park. Compared to the disneyland in LA, lotte world is like 1/10 the size. It's just so tiny and the rides were not really ""thrilling"" at all. The horror house was literally a 10 minute 3D video for 5 year olds. If you have young kids, then lotte world wouldn't be a bad choice, but if you're over 15 years old, I suggest everland over lotte world.",417,hour

So I made plan thoroughly and almost succeeded this time.(that means I spend more money and I rode more rides and waited less)  What I want to tell you guys is that  1. Lotte is not a Korean enterprise(actually it's more like Japanese company). 2. It's hard to find any employee who can speak English fluently. 3. There are not enough space for visitors to hide from sun ray on the 'magic island'. 4. Don't go there on the weekend. 5. Foods are expensive and crappy in Lotte world. 6.

420,65,505,"I have been to many theme parks around the world, but i had a lot of fun in Lotte World, even though the rides are not extreme at all. Its just a fun place in general and something different to do when you are not busy doing all the cultural activities. We ended up going after 4pm to take advantage of the cheaper tickets as we didn't think we needed a whole day anyway. We spent around 5 hours here during a weekday and we managed to visit all the main rides (although one or two rides were out of service). The only problem we had was that we enjoyed trying to cram in as many rides as possible, that by the time we finished up, we realised the park was closing and all food and snack shops were closing up. You wont need more than 5 hours here in this park and its very easy to reach by MRT. And also, just take note, around 8pm there is a parade that happens inside which is quite cool, but it means a lot of the rides will close down for the duration of this 20-30 minute parade.",420,hour
421,66,507,"We reached there at around 2pm and wanted to stay till the night as the park opens late for that day. The day has been gloomy thus, we have already expected all outdoor attractions to be closed. Upon reaching, we saw that most attractions had queues of 80min and up. We proceeded to utilize the magic pass mobile app in hopes to snag a magic pass however the app was loading the whole time and could not even get us to the landing page.  We went on to walk around the premises to see if there were attractions with shorter queue. As we walked on, the app finally loaded and we checked on waiting time to see a few attractions 0-15min wait. Upon rushing it, were we told that the ride was under maintenance which was why the app reflected such a short waiting time.  The park had similar naming rides that we rushed in order to make it in time for the magic pass only to know that we were at the wrong location. After an hour or so, we so frustrated by what's happening that we went to the customer service counter to see what else Lotte World could offer. We were shocked to know that at the point of our query, only a total of 8 rides (and they were all kiddie attractions) or lesser were available as all the others were under maintenance!  I can't imagine heading into a theme park and wanting out so badly due to what is happening. We were there for 3hours, 1 hour was spent on lunch and the remaining 2 was spent finding and getting rejected from rides. The good thing out of the whole situation, we managed to get on 1 ride which we thought were for adults but nope it wasn't.",421,hour

Rules and procedures were easy to follow! We are going back another day on this trip to get more practice and to visit the many others entertainment areas.",422,hour
423,68,525,"The park itself is ok. Not huge but some good rides both indoor and outdoor. Like some people who don’t mind paying a bit extra for “fast passes”, we paid for extra “Magic Passes”. But using them proved impossible. You have to download their app to make “reservations”. These reservations close every time the very few slots have been allocated. For a first timer with young family, we did not realize that we need to literally “stalk” the app every 15 mins to secure those precious slots. And for one reason or another, the navigation is super unintuitive for the first couple of times. Since the slots are gone literally 3 seconds after each time period opens, it’s a race of fast fingers.  Of our couple of hours there, we couldn’t get on that many. And as the family leader, I found myself being a slave to the stupid app rather than being able to fully enjoy myself.  Would have asked for a refund for those unused stupid Magic Passes if staff could speak more English.  Will not return.",423,hour

425,70,533,"Visited Lotte world with my 11 year old pre teen. Booked tickets on KLOOK - got the one with 5 premium magic passes each. Did not regret it one bit. These magic passes are used like the Disneyland fast passes, simply present the passes (indicated on the ticket and struck off once used for a ride) , enter a separate queue for magic pass and board the ride! It was challenging trying to obtain magic passes using the app - the entrance ticket itself includes 3 magic passes - but these are subject to availability. We did not bother obtaining any after failing in the first hour.  To avoid the crowd, we purposely visited on a Monday. Got in at 930 once the park opened. Finished the thrill rides by 1130 with merely 5-10 min queues each. By noon the lines were snaking around. But it didn't look too bad - wait time was 15-30 min max. We opted to use our premium magic passes for repeat rides which my daughter really enjoyed! The park was most crowded from mid afternoon onwards. Our favorites were the Atlantis and gyro swing. (We are adrenaline junkies) Unfortunately the gyro drop and French Revolution were closed for maintenance.  For the price paid, it was a fun day out! Very value for money. Do not forget to explore the underland - these were the bulk of the VR rides- so avoid if prone to get motion sickness or giddy.  Food was decently priced, not exorbitant for a theme park. A large drink and popcorn chicken went for 6000won. Please do yourself a favor and rent a locker - 1000won only - per use - can't open repeatedly.",425,hour

Yes it was a fun ride but will i go for another ride and wait for hours? Hell no!  And the Magic Pass app is a useless app, can't reserve any rides at all! Wasted my hald day there.",427,hour
428,73,541,"Had a fun afternoon/evening with friends.  A few tips: - Tickets are normally 55,000 won, but you can get discounted tickets on Klook for 28,000 won with the option to get the Magic Pass x 3 or 5 for an additional 22,000 - 34,000 won - which I would highly recommend. - If you do buy tickets on Klook you enter via the South gate - The Magic Pass lets you skip the queue, which most of the main rides had a wait time of 1.5 - 2 hours. - Don't download the app to try and reserve a spot on the ride to skip/queue thing and don't try and use the Magic pass Kiosk - the app kept crash and only let you book in 15 minute slots which filled up pretty quickly and the same with the kiosks. - - The rides for the magic pass would say 'close' but when we walked up to try and use our ticket the attendant will mark off your ticket let you straight though - winner (after mucking around with the app and kiosk for quite some time)",428,hour
429,74,558,Do yourself a favour and don't buy the tickets with rides if you do not have atleast 1 full day.The queues are extremely long and the wait is anywhere from 1-2 hours for each ride.

Navigation for our senior family member was not smooth sailing as the elevator was always full and only stsirs from basement to ground. The place has a lot to offer but the shoulder-to-shoulder guests made it difficult to enjoy during December holidays.,430,hour
431,76,572,Went there with my family of 4 and most of the outdoor rides were closed because of winter time and a lot of indoor rides were under inspection hence closed. They didn't even tell the patrons when we bought the tickets! The rest of the rides were either too kiddy even for my 6 years old or the queue was like 2 hours. We ended up spending only 2 hours there and took 1 ride which is the merry go-round. Totally a bad experience. Cannot go during winter time. This place is also meant for toddlers. Far far from disney standard!,431,hour
432,77,577,"Visited on a day that was pouring with rain with the hopes that the world's (apparently) largest indoor themepark would have something to offer. Even for a Monday, the place was packed. To make it worse, the outdoor attractions shut down in the rain, making indoors even more crowded. There were three-hour queues snaking around the park! If you're used to the likes of Universal Studios, I would say to give Lotte World a miss if you're only in Seoul for a week.",432,hour

I took a total of 2 rides in the entire afternoon with a one and half hour queue time each!  However what I’ve observed is that it’ll be a great place for kids in winter. Lots of kiddy rides that’s indoor, away from the harsh winter air.  Will recommend coming in other seasons.",433,hour
434,79,580,"Lotte World has both an indoor and outdoor theme park, and because its within the city, expect huge crowds at the various rides. Be prepared to spend up to 2 hours waiting in line for your turn on the more popular, ie, thrilling rides. Lots of food options available, but I didn't spend much time on that. Lunch and dinner was a sandwich, and I ate whilst queuing. The Comet Express (outdoor) and the French Revolution (indoor) rollercoasters will send your head spinning, which is what I came for, and got it!",434,hour

437,82,597,"We brought 2 kids, age 4 and 6, to Lotte World theme park and they had whale of a time. Although my younger girl can’t take most rides (shorter than 110cm), she thoroughly enjoy the 2.30pm and 8.30pm parade and the magic show at Fairy Theatre.  We were there 11.30am - 9pm and honestly, only manage to cover the whole indoor adventure park but for outdoor, barely cover 20%. Will highly recommend families to stay whole day. If you wish to visit the Lotte Aquarium or Pororo Park, please arrange separately as the 1 Day pass for your to enter Lotte World theme park, when you exit, cannot re-enter.  I had gone to Pororo Park on 2 other days; 2 hours (this is the limit for the ticket entry price) on each day. The small playground with slide, rooms with Lego blocks and building blocks, Pororo & Friends performance, the big bouncing castle, carousel (only open for small intervals on weekday), ferries Wheel and bumper car are all really fun for both my kids. Although it is more crowded on weekend, the rides are all more frequent, hence don’t really need to queue much. Personally, think my kids had more fun on weekend as they manage to catch more rides during the 2 hours compared to a weekday. And parents with preschoolers, trust me, although it is only 2 hours, it is enough to exhaust them that the kids will sleep early that day!",437,hour

My friends and I went to both Lotte world and Everland, and although Lotte world looks more 'kiddish' in appearance, the rides here are actually more thrilling than the ones at Everland (only the T express is thrilling there, but requires an almost 2h long wait). The pirate ship ride here was faster, and went up higher. There is both an indoor and outdoor portion, and you can easily spend a few hours here! I also highly recommend the Flume ride, Gyro Swing and the Atlantis!! However, some rides were unfortunately unavailable due to the weather, but you can download the app to check when they open!

All ages would enjoy this amusement park, as it caters to those who like placid activities as well as adrenaline junkies.  Unfortunately, we went at the start of August, when Korean holidays were on. Accordingly, the lines for most of the rides were very long. For example, I waited over an hour to ride the French Revolution.  Surprisingly, one of the best things about this theme park was the Italian Restaurant. The Margherita Pizza (albeit expensive) was, quote possibly, the best pizza I have ever had in my life!

448,93,668,"I went here as part of my college university in Seoul, so I can't tell you much about ticketing since it was free for me, HOWEVER I can tell you what to expect inside. After handing your ticket to the people in the front they will return it, MAKE SURE YOU KEEP IT ON YOU BECAUSE SOME RIDES WILL ASK FOR PROOF OF PURCHASE! If you go in the morning I highly suggest hitting the outside rides first, just because it's still cool outside and the lines will be relatively short. For those that have a waist line bigger than 32 inches, some rides might not be good for you just based on the fact that in Asia, many things, including roller coasters are built for smaller people. I am a larger woman, and i was able to ride the bumper cars, the spin guro, the hot air balloons, the carasole, and there were a few others that I opted out of that would be accommodating to larger people. Bring your own food. While there is food in the amusement park, and it is relatively cheap in comparison to parks in the U.S. it is still just amusement food. I ate at ""school food"" which has some good kimbap and ddeokbokki. If you have younger ones, or if you're not good with big crowds then definitely avoid the weekends where it gets pretty packed and the lines get lengthy (it was an hour for the hot air balloons). All in all it was fun, but it is packed. Definitely a tourist spot and workers are decent with English :)",448,hour

My girl aged 8 wanted to try the roller coaster etc but the average waiting time is more than 1 hour. Even for the hot air balloon, we had to queue for 60 minutes which I feel that it is not worth the wait. Most of the time was spent waiting, hence it was rather annoying for us.  I understand that there is an app which allows us to book the timing in advance but it is not working that well. Though it mentioned that the next booking timing but whenever, the booking is opened, the app will hang and by the time it recovers, the booking is closed again.  However, 1 plus point is that it is air conditioned hence not as hot as other theme parks.

450,95,687,If you have children and are at a loss of ideas on where to go Lotte World would provide your kids with hours of fun. From Myeongdong it takes less than an hour to travel to Jamsil station which is directly connected to the park. It's a huge place with indoor and outdoor area. For those who want to escape from the summer heat will enjoy the fact that there are also many attractions in the indoor area. The rides are okay but some of the 3D shorting games was a tad disappointing. Avoid weekends and public holidays. We went on a weekday morning so it was relatively sane. We didn't need to wait long for the rides. By afternoon we se hordes of school kids there for their school trip. Time to leave. It was a fun experience but not so impressive enough for me to want to visit again. Then again I'm not really into amusement Parks.,450,hour

452,97,691,I personally love Lotte World and expect to go there everytime I go to Seoul. I would recommend to spend the whole day here or you can go in after 4pm and have a discount. Check the weather really carefully because most of the awesome rides are outside The lines are super long if you go on the weekends. About 3 hours to the max. If you do not speak Korean and have a question just ask a staff. NOT a student. There are a lot of student who come for a school trip and they tend to get worried if you talk to them not because they think you're weird or anything. Most Korean people get all flustered if you speak with them. Try the snacks if you're willing to splurge. Try the VR French Revolution or the Haesung Tuk Gup. Its really fast and worth waiting for. You can also reserve you ride with an app. You can reserve up to three rides I believe. Also check the official site for special event discounts. For example if it were Halloween if you have three of the same letter in your name as Halloween you get a discount. Check the official site and bring your ID with you. If you are spending the whole day go as early as possible. People in Korea wait about two hours before opening. Don't do that unless you want the full experience.,452,hour

On average I think I spent about 1 and a half hour queuing for each ride. The queues can be quite painful, but the rides were well worth the queue. I would suggest reaching Lotte World the moment it opens and going straight for the few rides you really want to go for first. Because the waiting times for some of the more exciting rides become 2 and a half hours later in the afternoon. There are many restaurants in the theme park too and they are surprisingly not expensive. Also, weather is not really an issue since most of the rides are indoors! Overall, I had a great day there.

Didn't go to Everland the week I went as a result of finding out how bogged down with people this place gets.  As I left in the late afternoon, the queue was much worse.

Follow the entry instructions and make sure you take the passport in which the voucher was registered.  Lotte World itself is crazy busy at any time. Suggest you get there as early as you can. Queues can be lengthy. Download the Lotte World app to receive three magic passes for quicker entry to your selected rides (though wait times can still be more than two hours).  The five year old loved his age appropriate rides. Yes, there is a height restriction and as long as above 110cm, then they are allowed on most of the kiddy rides.

We even got a discount as they offer discounts after 4pm on the day Pass. There was a waiting of almost 30-45 mins on all the popular rides but it was worth waiting in the queue. We loved the V. R roller coaster and air balloon ride. If you have the patience of waiting for 45 mins per ride then its definitely worth buying a day pass to spend a few hours in th evening.

Be sure to get a map so you can navigate the rides that you're interested in. We decided to just pick the thrill rides because we only had a few hours till closing. The queues were an average of 30-45 mins, but the waits are VERY worth it. The thrill rides are super fun we even queued twice for The Atlantis (Magic Island).  There's loads of F&B options and restrooms were conveniently located and very clean. We stayed till closing and at about 8pm they have a float parade at the main atrium of Adventure world which is beautiful to watch. We really felt our inner children come alive when we were there.

It was also stuffy and after a while inside, we were dying for some fresh air. We were there for only 4 hours and managed just one ride - the Fly Venture.

We went on a weekday when Korean schools were in session, and the park was still incredibly crowded, with 1.5 to 2 hour long waits for major attractions. Most of the park is indoors and was unpleasantly noisy as sound echoed off the walls. My 11 year old was forbidden to ride many of the ""kid"" rides because of her height, but as a parent (taller than my daughter) I was allowed to accompany my younger children. We love Korea, but this is a typical example of the rigid, nonsensical (to the American mind) rule-following that is commonplace here. The kids were begging to leave by late afternoon, and we gladly obliged them. Overall, a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. I would recommend Everland over this place -- avoid Lotte World like the plague.",467,hour

This is my 2nd time visiting Lotte World, bought the discount ticket (30% off) from Trip Maker through my guesthouse, and I went there on Saturday and omg that was a disaster!!!! Arrived there at 11am and left at 8pm (7 hours), I have spent almost 4 - 5 hours ONLY lining up and looked at my phone :(  No doubt the rides and everythings are cool and entertaining in the Lotte World, both indoor and outdoor, but there are sooooo many people; For the most famous rides like Gyro Spin and Atlantis, I have spent 45 mins queuing for each lel.  I don't think I need to describe how fun it is in the theme park since they are more or less the same seriously... yeah Lotte World makes you feel joyful and excited when you step in the indoor park, but for real, when you get closer to the ride and once you spot the end of the queue, and start lining up, and wait for 15 mins, and wait for 30 mins, still a long way to go, I am sure you will get mad. (I was with my boyfriend and we were getting more tired and even stopped talking...)  I strongly suggest my fellow travellers, try to avoid visit Lotte World on Friday/Saturday/Sunday!!!!!  My first visit to Lotte World back in 2014, I paid full-price and only spent 4 hours there becasue I was so fed up with the queuing. Thought it would be better for my re-visit after 2 years, still the same..smh",468,hour

Ive been to universal, adventure island cedar point, six flags busch gardens and disney all this year. Lotte world was a Great mix of rides, rollercoasters and sights, attractions. There are parts of the park that were a obvious rip off of disneyland. Its located inside of a large shopping complex and right next to a hotel. Its a MUST visit for anyone with children, wanting to have fun on a business trip or just wanting to have something different to do. The Main rollercoaster is a BLAST, and would rival most coasters in any major park. The size of the park and all the things to see and do are amazing and well worth the coast of apprx. $65 per person to go in and ride the rides. you can purchase a $30 ticket but that won't allow you access to the rides. Find the time to spend a few hours you will be glad you did!",474,hour
475,120,804,"We went to Lotte World, on a beautiful October day in Seoul. Our guesthouse (Mmmio house, highly recommended) was close to a subway station and from there it took us about half an hour to get to Lotte World, on the other side of the river, which splits Seoul in two parts. Upon arrival at the Jamsil station (green line, 2, by subway), the signs direct you immediately to the Lotte Department Store and other Lotte ""things to do/see"", including Lotte Adventure World. As we prefer not to wait in line, we were excited to see ticket machines, which also displayed information in English. After having tried all of them we asked staff why the English version on the machines did not work and were told that the machines are not for foreigners. Staff very nicely directed us to the counter to buy tickets. Second in line, suddenly the counter closed and we were directed to another line. This was not nice but ok, since only about 6 people were waiting in front of us now. After half an hour (!!) waiting we could finally buy our ticket, but were asked for our passports. Not being made aware by anybody that we needed passports, I luckily realized that I had a residence card from another country with me. A few discussions later with different staff, we were allowed to buy four tickets. The cost, USD 150, seemed high. It was a fairly quiet day in the park, so the waiting for most attractions was not bad. The park has three or four levels and from each level you can see the levels below. There is also an outside area with more attractions. The park is in the middle of the city and it is quite amazing how they have used the limited space to build so many attractions. Although we had tickets which allowed us to access all attractions, we did have to pay for one attraction, the Tomb of horror (or something like that). It is approx USD 2.5 per person. Everland is a more recently opened amusement park and bigger than Lotte Adventure World, but further away. Early 2016, a brand new amusement park will be opened.",475,hour
476,121,813,"Walking in I was delighted, walking out I was so glad to leave. We went on a Tuesday, got there at 11 (place opened at 9:30), went to the Comet, located in the outdoor section of the park (Magic) which we thought would be like Space Mountain from what I saw online. Wait time said 80 minutes. I would estimate we waited for 2 hours before we got on the actual ride, which was vaguely Space-Mountain-ish and mildly entertaining, but certainly not worth the wait. It was hot, so we went back inside to try to find another ride. All the ""thrill"" (coaster-type) rides listed a 120 minutes wait, which probably meant 2.5 hours. We wandered around inside a bit more (it is pretty cool to look at - they cram so much inside, including people!) until we decided to bail. A complete waste of money. Tried to be Disney but failed in every way. Disinterested employees, rides with too little capacity, signs ineffective (no lie, it took us 25 minutes to find the way back out to the street!). If you must go, don't pay the all-inclusive ticket (48,000 won for adults, barely cheaper for kids), pay the cheaper ticket price, wander around and pay for rides as you go (supposedly you have this option), if you can actually get on any.",476,hour
477,122,815,"Ok so before you go to Lotte World ask yourself a couple of questions.  Do you like lines? Do you like noisy eating areas? Do you like hidden costs? Do you want to feel more like a dollar sign and less like a human?  If you answered yes to these then Lotte World is for you!  The whole place is terribly busy and designed poorly, you feel crampt even not waiting in a line. When your waiting in a line prepare for camping a couple of hours with most main rides taking at least 120min wait. The rides that didn't, are poor or average at best.  The eating areas were open right next to rides so prepare for a noisy experience when you want to relax for lunch. Like dining in a club.  Many attractions inside actually cost money, so when you see a big queue and head for the short queue, you find it costs ₩3000.  The staff were very rude and not fun. They didn't care about their customers and didn't have that fun land happy attitude I would expect from such a place.  All in all the place was dull... With crampt almost unfinished rendered corridors at parts with dull lighting it almost seemed like each area had its own budget and refused to fund the walkways between.  Honestly everything that fails at this place is a win at Everland. Some people say they hate the happy music and smiles of Everland, but a place like this should be that way and trust me happy cheerful smiles go a long way to make the scene.  A final note  Please, just accept these things and you will have a good time. If you go in expecting a diamond you won't find that, just be patient, get a snack for the queues and don't limit yourself to a short visit.",477,hour
478,123,816,"This was an awesome experience and I'm so glad I went. It definitely feels like Disneyland's younger sister who is much smaller, but still tries to emulate her older sibling. It was fun to go on the different rides and be like...OH this is like Pirates of the Caribbean....or OH this is definitely their version of space mountain. They even have their version of Mickey and Minnie (The Fox's Lotty and Lorry). It was awesome.  Solo traveler: I'm 28 years old, I went by myself, and I had a blast. Definitely something easy and entertaining to do if you're traveling solo, as long as you don't mind being surrounded by teenagers.  Food: I had a smoothie, a Popsicle, and some fried won tons. I thought everything was pretty delicious.  Price: It was like $40 for an all day pass (which means you get to ride the rides). I thought that was well worth it. I only spent about 5 hours there, but I felt like I got my money's worth.",478,hour

We took advantage of the 50% off with military ID (or dependent) - thankfully had the kids IDs too since it's only good for 4 tickets. We spent 5 hours there and no one did everything but we filled every minute with fun. The teenagers and tweens took off and did their own thing at the park, even managed to get their ticket replaced on their own when one of them lost theirs. Reminder, you need to show your ticket at every ride so keep it handy and on each person if possible. They did the indoor roller coasters and outdoor ones as well. The moms took the younger set to do all that was available and didn't get through all of it! Fair food is very good, especially the soda/fried cheese balls combo, always a hit with my guys. 9 year olds went on the log flume solo which was about a 15 minute wait at 12 noon and loved it. Too bad our favorite ride, the Dinosaur 3D target practice was closed for inspection. And the kids really enjoyed the trick eye exhibit on 4F.

484,129,853,"Lotte World is advertised as the World's Largest Indoor Amusement Park. It surely feels like it. The huge dome with its central skating ring and surrounding rides are an impressive sight. Having such a large park in the heart of a 25 million metropolis is amazing. However, Lotte World might not be your best option for entertainment in or around Seoul. Lotte World is straight up inferior to Everland ride-wise, with fewer rides, especially thrill rides such as roller coasters, which also means that each ride will be packed with quite a long line that can top an hour for the best rides. So if you're a roller coaster enthusiast, I recommend checking out Everland instead. In addition, the park is 25 years old and feels like it. It doesn't feel quite new, especially for outside attractions. The park's attractions and stores all have this ""slightly off"" color and design that didn't age all too well. Also, the Lotte World now fails in comparison to the building next door, the new 2nd Lotte World complex, which features numerous dining and shopping options, as well as what will soon become the tallest tower in the OCDE. Overall, I do recommend checking out the park and its surroundings, but would advise against staying there an entire day. The good thing is that for people who come in rather late in the afternoon, the park offers discounted price, and that's a great value proposition to just come in and enjoy the park for 3 or 4 hours rather than the entire day.",484,hour

After, we head straight to the Hot Air Balloons.. love how they float them and travel in the Lotte World for one round. After this, we went opposite Lotte World where the rides are.

489,134,886,"It's a MUST-DO in Seoul, especially if you haven't been exposed to the amusement parks. Not crazy fun like Six-Mountains, but you don't have to pay $80 for a day either. You pay $60-70 for Disneyland HK and Tokyo, but I paid only $20; there were plenty of deals to cut the ticket price cut to the half. It's not definitely like dreamland (Disneyland or Universal Studios) or extreme ultimatim (Six-Flags), but I made sure to visit off peak hours, so that I didn't need to queue for a while. The portfolio or rides and equipments were very well balanced, from family to epic-high stuff, and the mixture of indoor and outdoor. Food inside is quite good but pricey as any other amusement parks. There are gourmet restaurants outside the park, so make sure to come out and enjoy the food and shopping. The parade & circus show are something kids love about. I'd visit again. Make sure to avoid weekend or summer time, when youngsters come any time and cause a long queue.",489,hour

It takes forever for you to be able to ride an attraction. They say that patience is a virtue but I'd rather visit other attractions in Seoul than to wait there for atleast an hour or 2 to be able to enjoy. The only atrraction that won't take too long are the kiddie rides but I tell you, they are boring.

Given that you are not distracted by the shopping arcade along the way. It was on a Friday that we went to check it out. It was pretty crowded with tourists, school children and local people. However, the longer queue took only 30 minutes. Our kids loved the theme park, especially the Camelot Carousel, World monorail, kids bumper cars and train rides. However, we were disappointed that the balloon rides for small kids were under maintenance. We suggested family with small kids should do some homework prior visiting. There were rides that need accompany and most of the rides require kids to be above 110cm.

Food options in outdoor park is mainly finger food. More restaurant options are available in the indoor park. Big bugbear for me is that your entrance ticket does not allow you to step out of the park at all. Perhaps this is deliberate to get you to patronise from their eateries since there will be much more cheaper and better food options nearby just outside the park.

Everything there is expensive, but you'd have to expect that at a tourist place like this. It was very busy and the line ups for most rides were very sizable, so be prepared to stand in line potentially a LONG time - over an hour wouldn't be surprising.  So if you've got kids and are willing to stay the entire day then you might want to check it out.

The crowd started streaming in after lunch hour and queues started to form.  Took the French Revolution* (indoor roller coaster) after a 45min queue.  then roamed around more, took ALL the rides we passed by and left after the Laser Show.  * these rides are the most worth it if you're into highspeed twist and turns... if you scream during a viking ride... you should give them a miss... lol...",498,hour
499,144,911,"We went to Lotte World last week and it was flooded with mainland Chinese tourists. We went a little after 4pm on a weekday afternoon and definitely did NOT have a good time. We went up to the top floor three times to check on the wait time for the hot air balloon and it was over an hour each time so we didn't bother. We did manage to do the monorail and it was OK. Our young kids (5 and 7) enjoyed the bumper car rides and treebee's hopper, and Kidstoria but it was not a fun experience for the adults.  The cafeteria was clean and served basic food at reasonable price (like everywhere else in Seoul).  The overall decor is cheesy and dated, and there are few English language signs around. No comparison to Disneyland please save your money and go somewhere else.",499,hour

Spent most of the time walking around indoor and to the outdoor theme park. We only got on 3 rides. Nevertheless, my daughter aged 7 had a splendid time in Pororo Park which is located in the indoor theme park. Additional entry ticket is require though.",501,hour
502,147,927,"Looks great but were unfortunately disappointed, at first it looks really exciting and spectacularly decorated but the rides are quite basic. We experienced a situation here which never before has been experienced anywhere else in the world for us. Both me and the person I was travelling with suffer some medical problems which mean its better to go back to the hotel for a rest and to take medication, also wanted to look around the shops there and get something to eat. We asked when buying a day pass that we needed to do this and the person at the counter said it was fine. When we attempted to leave the staff refused to let us leave and said if we leave we wont be allowed back in unless we pay for another day pass. They were unprofessional and rude, and I was thinking it could be a language mistake. so after multiple questions we demanded to see someone who could speak English fluently, they confirmed this was the rule but this staff member was very friendly and arranged for us to be let in after we left, it was a ridiculous rule as ive been to theme parks all over the world and never not been let out before! Please keep in mind that this is an even more stupid rule because the indoor theme park is a part of a huge shopping complex, and outside the gates are multiple food courts and restaurants, inside the park is a very limited range of food or shops and is also more expensive. The whole complex is owned by Lotte aswell, so I dont know what the problem is in letting people out. It seemed most of the locals had yearly passes so were allowed to come and go as they pleased.  We first noticed on arrival that the staff were very unfriendly, and rude, some even look like life is so painful they would gladly be euthanized if given the option, this was quite disappointing as we came here to have a happy day out at the end of a long trip but ended up being quite downbeat due to their attitude and poor organisation. I was told that this was the Korean way though! Disneyland is the happiest place on earth for a reason and this place doesn't come close!  The park is very hard to find things, you can see a ride that looks interesting but walk around for hours looking for the entrance to it! Staff had no English skills mostly so wasn't any use to ask them. Signage was really bad, Especially bad that very little was in English as-well.  Most of the more exciting rides were closed for maintenance or had extremely long lines so we were forced to go on the less popular ones. The park is clearly a poor copy of a Disney park but it could be so much better with a little work. We were adults but also noticed there werent many rides for younger children, but the Sinbad ride was very good for all ages for people who dont like thrill rides but still want a little adventure with the drops and everything.  The Parades were disorganised but interesting to watch. I would recommend going to Lotteworld if its a less busy day and if you like theme parks, definitely wouldn't attempt going here on the weekend or a public holiday.  The guidebooks say to get off at a certain train station, but again theres no signage to LOTTEWorld, or any map or guide to say where it was or even where the entrance was, was very confusing and we got there later than expected due to this.  Unfortunately poor communication and organisation lets this park down in what could be a really amazing experience. Part of what I liked about it was that it was a theme park in a new country so a new experience.",502,hour

The later the cheaper one.",506,hour
507,152,949,"The Lotte brand is everywhere in Korea from supermarkets to fast food to sky scraper apartment complexes covering several city blocks. Lotte also made several cartoon characters to advertise their brands. These Korean cuddly characters cover the walls and wander around in costume in the huge, indoor-outdoor Lotte World amusement park. The sheer size of the indoor portion of the park is amazing. It is eight stories from the ice skating rink at the bottom to the balloon ride on the ceiling, all indoors with carnival style mini rides to fair sized roller coasters. None of the rides compare to a Six Flags experience, but it is INDOORS! This is a huge feat of engineering, but more importantly, it makes it a comfortable experience in the monsoon season, the hot and humid summer or the unbearably cold winters. There are more rides outdoors. My 12 year old son loved the two towers. One is a tower drop, the other is a tower shot. They also have another roller coaster and a few other rides outside. When the weather is good, the outdoor rides make it worth the trip for older kids or ride junkies like me. Overall, it is a great destination for families with little kids or older ones looking for something to do in Seoul. Being in the Army, we get US holidays off that allow us to visit tourist destinations on Mondays while the rest of Seoul is in school or at work. I've heard the lines are longer than an hour for most rides on the weekends. We waited 45 minutes for the indoor roller coaster. The weather was perfect, but the lines were much shorter outdoors. I almost forgot to mention one of the funniest parts of the visit: the translations on the dual language signs! I'm surprised that such a big-name corporation like Lotte must have used an auto translation for their signs. ""No Pregnant While Riding"" ""No Drunken Ride"" were two of our favorite Korenglish quotes.",507,hour
508,153,951,Most families and children we saw during our trips to Seoul. We got there in time for the evening parade - like a miniature Disneyland electrical parade. Their characters are cute animals like racoons. There are some rides but seems like for little children indoors. We did not have time to see what was outdoors but give your self several hours to explore. The food like any theme park is very expensive even for a hotdog and coffee. We visited in February 2011. There are many stores connected to Lotte World as well as Lotte World Hotel.,508,hour

Young children, in particular, would love it here as it's really catered for them. One regret I had was that I visited on a public holiday, so together with tourists, local Koreans and their families thronged this place. Wished that I had bought the Magic Pass to skip the queues as some rides, you will need to wait up to 2 hours long!",510,hour
511,156,990,"Visited Lotte World as part of a tour group package. Spent about 4 hours here, from 5pm to 9pm. Place was semi packed with mostly couple's and families. Certain attractions such as the horror house and mirror maze requires an additional fee of 3000won to enter.  Most of the rides were mild as this is a family theme park. Do try the ice skating rink on the lowest floor and there are several food options around to choose from",511,hour
512,157,994,We spent a Thursday afternoon at Lotte World indoor. It is great for the 6&4 yo that we have but it was so crowded. Every ride took a long wait and it felt that rides for small children were all filled by teenagers. We spent US$150 for ultimately 4 rides and that took us 3 hours and all our energy. Safety precautions seemed way over the top (e.g. all had to wear a safety belt in the carrousel).,512,hour
513,158,995,Avoid at Christmastime! Great place to visit but queuing for 2 hours for most rides took the shine off. I don't know how much a magic pass is but I think it would be worth investigating to go to the front of every line.,513,hour
514,159,996,"Lotte World is a large indoor theme park covering multi stories and including an outdoor area. The rides range from kiddie rides through to relatively large roller coasters that older kids will love. If you’re coming in winter, be prepared to layer on and off if you’re going to be in or outside.  Best to arrive first thing when the crowds are small and queues are short - go to the most popular rides first - Atlantis, French Revolution, Pharaoh’s Rage etc. otherwise be prepared to queue for up to 2 hours when the crowd builds up especially in the holiday season.  The park is clean and well presented and offers a Disney-eque feel complete with their own Snow White Castle.  The entry ticket (we got 20% off using MasterCard) is generally all inclusive (a small handful of rides require extra payment). There is a range of food from local to western. Prices are generally higher than outside.  There is a Lotte World app that can book Magic Passes (like Disney fast passes) but we couldn’t get them to work; perhaps they need to be booked first thing. So, suggest some pre-planning is essential to get the best out of the park.",514,hour
515,160,1007,Actually everything there is amazing but the problem is all the time crowded and alot of people special after 12 pm but in weekend from when lotte world open until close they accept millions of people to much people and if you need to play sometimes you need to wating like one hour for one game or 2 hour i just suggest to visit there but in weekdays spical in middle of the week,515,hour

Upon knowing of my condition since 13 Oct 2018, the Club Lounge staff had been very concerned each time they see me, and during breakfasts, would recommend what to drink and eat to better manage the condition of my extreme throat inflammation. Specifically on the 13 Oct 2018 morning, the two Club Lounge staff had helped to find the nearest clinic for me upon request and followed up with me on their own accord an hour later if I was going to the clinic. Another special mention would be the male lobby senior staff who, upon my inquiry of direction, brought me to the clinic for fear I might find it difficult to locate.  Very thankful for the concern and dedication of the hotel staff during my visit to Korea this time. Grateful to have made the acquaintance of the hotel staff.

519,164,1036,This was a great place to take our kids 9 & 13. There’s 4 floors of rides and games. There’s also a lot of fun thrilling rides outside the building that kids and adults will have fun on. We spent about 8 hours here just playing games and ice skating.,519,hour

If you rarely go to large theme parks, then you'll like lotte world. I really didnt like lotte world because it was so tiny that I could cover the entire amusement park in under 4 hours. I don't know about other countries, but in America, disneyland is so huge that it takes a whole day just to cover one section of the park. Compared to the disneyland in LA, lotte world is like 1/10 the size. It's just so tiny and the rides were not really ""thrilling"" at all. The horror house was literally a 10 minute 3D video for 5 year olds. If you have young kids, then lotte world wouldn't be a bad choice, but if you're over 15 years old, I suggest everland over lotte world.",520,hour

I took a total of 2 rides in the entire afternoon with a one and half hour queue time each!  However what I’ve observed is that it’ll be a great place for kids in winter. Lots of kiddy rides that’s indoor, away from the harsh winter air.  Will recommend coming in other seasons.",525,hour

Also, there is shopping center nearby to escape the heat and the crowd.",528,hour
529,174,1133,1 hour from central. this indoor & outdoor park is big. with many rides. whether you visit in weekend or weekdays it is extremely over crowded with locals. you have to wait 30-60 minutes for most of the rides. we have spent 5-6 hours and hardly enjoyed 7-8 rides. we have spent whole day standing from one queue to another. You have to pay money for many rides. and many rides are boring and mostly for kids. so not worth standing in queue for long time. few restaurants inside.,529,hour

531,176,1146,"We went there as 3 families with young children (aged from 2 to 8). We had deliberately avoid the weekend and went on a Mon but Lotte world was very crowded. My girl aged 8 wanted to try the roller coaster etc but the average waiting time is more than 1 hour. Even for the hot air balloon, we had to queue for 60 minutes which I feel that it is not worth the wait. Most of the time was spent waiting, hence it was rather annoying for us.  I understand that there is an app which allows us to book the timing in advance but it is not working that well. Though it mentioned that the next booking timing but whenever, the booking is opened, the app will hang and by the time it recovers, the booking is closed again.  However, 1 plus point is that it is air conditioned hence not as hot as other theme parks. (We did not have enough time to explore the portion outside though we understand there are 2 portions to it)  For the younger kids, I think they enjoyed the magic show.",531,hour
532,177,1151,If you have children and are at a loss of ideas on where to go Lotte World would provide your kids with hours of fun. From Myeongdong it takes less than an hour to travel to Jamsil station which is directly connected to the park. It's a huge place with indoor and outdoor area. For those who want to escape from the summer heat will enjoy the fact that there are also many attractions in the indoor area. The rides are okay but some of the 3D shorting games was a tad disappointing. Avoid weekends and public holidays. We went on a weekday morning so it was relatively sane. We didn't need to wait long for the rides. By afternoon we se hordes of school kids there for their school trip. Time to leave. It was a fun experience but not so impressive enough for me to want to visit again. Then again I'm not really into amusement Parks.,532,hour
533,178,1153,I personally love Lotte World and expect to go there everytime I go to Seoul. I would recommend to spend the whole day here or you can go in after 4pm and have a discount. Check the weather really carefully because most of the awesome rides are outside The lines are super long if you go on the weekends. About 3 hours to the max. If you do not speak Korean and have a question just ask a staff. NOT a student. There are a lot of student who come for a school trip and they tend to get worried if you talk to them not because they think you're weird or anything. Most Korean people get all flustered if you speak with them. Try the snacks if you're willing to splurge. Try the VR French Revolution or the Haesung Tuk Gup. Its really fast and worth waiting for. You can also reserve you ride with an app. You can reserve up to three rides I believe. Also check the official site for special event discounts. For example if it were Halloween if you have three of the same letter in your name as Halloween you get a discount. Check the official site and bring your ID with you. If you are spending the whole day go as early as possible. People in Korea wait about two hours before opening. Don't do that unless you want the full experience.,533,hour
534,179,1161,"Lotte world is huge!! I went on a Friday and spent an entire day there! Despite it being a weekday, the place was super crowded. On average I think I spent about 1 and a half hour queuing for each ride. The queues can be quite painful, but the rides were well worth the queue. I would suggest reaching Lotte World the moment it opens and going straight for the few rides you really want to go for first. Because the waiting times for some of the more exciting rides become 2 and a half hours later in the afternoon. There are many restaurants in the theme park too and they are surprisingly not expensive. Also, weather is not really an issue since most of the rides are indoors! Overall, I had a great day there. But it was really tiring to queue though.",534,hour

I was told the queue for the roller Coaster outside was 3 hours long. Everything else inside looked really long too.  The inside section of the park needs some serious updating. Didn't go to Everland the week I went as a result of finding out how bogged down with people this place gets.  As I left in the late afternoon, the queue was much worse. There really should be a cap to the number of people they let come into this place.  And whatever yoυ do, absolutely avoid any holidays. Especially the first week in May.",536,hour
537,182,1169,"Never pay full price for entry tickets if you're a foreigner. There are a number of ways to get cheaper entrance tickets and we used Funtastic Korea voucher (received 45% discount).

Follow the entry instructions and make sure you take the passport in which the voucher was registered.  Lotte World itself is crazy busy at any time. Suggest you get there as early as you can. Queues can be lengthy. Download the Lotte World app to receive three magic passes for quicker entry to your selected rides (though wait times can still be more than two hours).  The five year old loved his age appropriate rides. Yes, there is a height restriction and as long as above 110cm, then they are allowed on most of the kiddy rides. They measure you pretty much at each ride (there are a few allowing 90cm).",537,hour

I don't think I need to describe how fun it is in the theme park since they are more or less the same seriously... yeah Lotte World makes you feel joyful and excited when you step in the indoor park, but for real, when you get closer to the ride and once you spot the end of the queue, and start lining up, and wait for 15 mins, and wait for 30 mins, still a long way to go, I am sure you will get mad. (I was with my boyfriend and we were getting more tired and even stopped talking...)  I strongly suggest my fellow travellers, try to avoid visit Lotte World on Friday/Saturday/Sunday!!!!!  My first visit to Lotte World back in 2014, I paid full-price and only spent 4 hours there becasue I was so fed up with the queuing. Thought it would be better for my re-visit after 2 years, still the same..smh",538,hour

It is a shame however that unless you're willing to stand in lines of at least an hour, you can't really do much. Any of the attractions that are really worth going on are minimum hour sometimes significantly more. The locals didn't seem to mind and perhaps that's a cultural thing but lining up for an hour then having a five minute ride, only to line up for another hour wore thin very quickly. I could only imagine it with a couple of kids (although again, no local kids seemed to mind from what I could tell!). Steep entry fee but it probably is worth a look just to actually view the place.",545,hour

The rides are fun but the 3D haunted house show was so boring and screen was not clear. Need to improve on that. The rides were great but simply too Long queue. So for about 6 hours spent there we only took 4 rides and 1 3D show.  Felt real old among all the youngster.

We went on a Monday and it wasn't too crowded and we downloaded the app but the fast pass only takes a limited number of people for the day and we couldn't ride any of the really popular rides - didn't want to wait for 2 hours. It is small enough to do in a day and not wear yourself out. My family ages 14 to 7 years had fun. Although my 7 year old was too tall to ride the little kids rides. The food was good and very reasonably priced. We got our tickets in advanced through Trazy.com,550,hour
551,196,1300,This is definitely a place for small children. Everything is geared for the young kids who like fairytales. If you have visited Disney or any of the Great America Parks the only thing to say is that the lines are shorter. The rides are on a caliber of many of the County and Neighborhood fairs throughout America. That said we spent an enjoyable four hours walking around and watching tons of people of people really having fun. There were groups of kids from schools and parents with their kids getting the thrill of a lifetime.,551,hour
552,197,1302,"Comfy nursery and changing room for nursing mothers, refreshing toilets, lots of locker for safe-keeping, lots of food, drinks,snack and souvenir stalls. The only low point is that December is not the best month to enjoy this indoor /outdoor theme park. Too crowded and such long que which you may end up only having 2 fun rides after spending almost 5 hours in the park.",552,hour
553,198,1308,"You know how a Samsung phone is fine if that's all you have, but the design and interface pales in comparison to an iPhone? Lotte World is like that compared to a Disneyland experience. It's modeled after Disneyland, but is an obvious fake, but entertaining to see nonetheless.  We managed to visit with an online 50% off deal for foreign passport holders for 24,000 Won each (about $20 USD). So for that price, it was a fine thing to do. The wait for rides was 60-90 minutes in the heat with nothing to look at, not like at Disneyland where the lines are even an immersive part of the ride.  Atlantis was a great ride that we did twice. French Revolution was so jarring that it gave us all mild concussions. The wait for the hot air balloons and the Comet Express were 70+ minutes, so we skipped those. We knew we were visiting Tokyo Disneysea a few days later, so we felt we had all gotten our $20 worth and called it a day after 3 rides that took about 5 hours to complete.  So if this is the only amusement park you can get to, it's fine. But if you have other experiences, Lotte World is fine only if you can get a big discount and have teenagers you need to appease for a day.",553,hour
554,199,1318,"We went here and walked around a few hours before the location closes. It was like being transported to a different world. There were a lot of rides, stores, food vendors, shows and photo opportunities in almost every corner. A must place to visit specially if you enjoy amusement parks or have kids. Also, getting there was easy. We took the metro and after 2 transfers and a few minutes walk, we were there.",554,hour

556,201,1327,"I went to Lotte World with a friend of mine and omg, sad to say it was not our cup of coffee. It was basically too crowded with locals. Waiting time of almost all rides was like 1 hour to two hours. I will say that it is good for kids as there is a large indoor theme park for kids however its not as good as Universal Studios to begin with since I overheard some locals saying that LotteWorld is the same as Universal Studios. Haunted house needs to be improved! It was super dissapointing that many people were afraid to get into the haunted house but all we just did was to be seated down and watch a 'scary' animation movie which is not even scary to begin with. The department store is not even something I will recommend to go too. If you are coming from places like Singapore, Malaysia, US, Europe, its basically the same store as every other shopping mall. Muslim travellers, there is no halal food at all but there is side stalls that sells waffles and stuffs that you can eat. Overall LotteWorld is dissapointing. Will not recommend anyone to go but if you are a first timer, why not try it once.",556,hour
557,202,1330,"The moment you enter inside lotte world, you will feel that you have stepped into another world and left city's hustle and bustle behind. It is hard to believe that you are still in the midst of the city. There are a number of rides here but the major minus point is you will have to wait hours together in the line for your turn to get the ride. But don't let this discourage you as the rides are worth the wait. An option to reduce your waiting time is download the lotte world app and after you buy your entry tickets, book your ride from the app. These people will get first preference to go for the rides. We came to know about this too late, so we couldn't avail this option.  Don't miss the gyro drop ride. It feels like you are having a free fall while sitting in a chair from 75 metres height. By the time you finish your ride, your adrenaline will be pumping into your veins and the euphoria is something to be experienced, not to be explained.",557,hour

You get a limited number of these but that could save you an hour of queing when it gets busy.  If you're not Korean suggest take passports with you as we found a half price offer for foreigners so we got in 2 4 1 :-) You can buy day tickets easily at the ticket desks.  There's a mix of rides varying from rollercoasters to the very impressive Gyro Swing. Some of the rides you'd expect to be a bit worse aren't (the aladdin one, log flume, jungle ride, bungee) and some of the roller coasters are actually more severe (possibly being designed for smaller average height people they don't always have the best neck support for taller people?). Overall though nothing to complain about. We enjoyed ourselves throughly.  Didn't check re the ice skating if you have to book in advance (assuming so). Massive rink in the centre of the bottom floor.  Earlier in the day is much quieter than midday to evening. Use fast passes sparingly or later on when it gets busy.  Loads of little street food type stalls around that compares favourably to the uk on price for our theme park food plus lots of small restaurants on site. Staff are friendly and helpful.",559,hour

One day is not enough to tour all the attraction especially with the long queue on the rides, sometimes it took us one hour before we can get into rides, it is really time consuming, so i suggest if you have the budget , book in their hotel for 2 days to maximize your visit. Good thing we were able to get cheap ticket, 60% discount. There were also lot of restaurant to choose from and they have lotte mart to shop which we did before leaving the park. You will really enjoy coming here as it is indoor with an air condition, so no problem if it rains.",561,hour

We went on a weekday so it wasn't too crowded but had to queue 20 min tiger the tickets. My kids had a lot of fun and in 3 hours we went on about 6 rides. I didn't like all the bright lights though. The excessive use of lighting is one thing about Seoul which I didn't like. It is worse than Tokyo. We got very tired and withdrawn mostly because of the lighting and because it was indoors. Still, a great day out on a rainy day.",562,hour

566,211,1416,If you like theme parks a bit sickly sweat and tung in check then this is great. We went in the evening so there were lots of teenagers and the queues for the rides were 40 minutes to a hour long. Only did a couple of the rides but they were good. Doing roller-coasters in the dark was a first for me and I quite liked it. The place shuts at 2200. It is quite expensive but if you have a local friend then certain banks and organisations can get you a big discount (we payed a third of the asking price by paying io a local bank card). There are also lots of rides for younger children and there was a big children's show on in the evening.,566,hour
567,212,1424,"Visited Lotte World at the end of a week-long holiday in Seoul. I have to say that while Lotte World is impressive at first sight, it ended up being more of a disappointment at the end. We went on a random Friday in October thinking that it would not be packed, but my husband and I were shocked to see the amount of Korean teenagers there in the middle of the school day. The queues for the best rides were HOURS, and the Lotte Magic Pass system only worked every 2 hours. By noon all of the Magic Pass reservations were closed, which was discouraging because if we would have stood in line for the estimated queue times for all the big rides, we would have been waiting until midnight. We came rather early (around 10:30) and already it was a mad house. I definitely felt like I wasted my last day in Seoul at Lotte World.",567,hour

Honestly, it isn't the most exciting theme park ever, but if you have a few hours to spare then might as well give it a go. It's located in a mall and there's an ice rink right in the center. There is also an outdoor section with a few more rides. We wanted to go on the roller coaster outside but unfortunately it was under construction.

Love taking photos 4. Enjoy ticking off first / biggest sort of places in your travel list and/or 5. Want to go ice skating in summer  I'm biased as I enjoyed going here partly because I've seen it in lots of kdramas. This is where we first tried korean fried chicken (Lotteria) & enjoyed eating against a colourful backdrop of balloons & stuff. The parade was also nice & fun.  The highlight for us was the folklore museum - the dioramas in the miniature village were really good & something even non-history buffs would appreciate judging by my husband's reaction.,570,hour

574,219,1470,This place is really good to visit and have fun with especially if you have kids.

After presentation, we had lunch and we were free to enjoy the whole place. Amazingly, theres indoor and outdoor theme park. Due to our schedule, we had only 4hours to explore the whole place. Some rides are really just for kids, u have to choose the right rides. Indoor theres like mirror world, roller coaster, and ice skating ring. Outdoor theres the bigger rides like gyro swing and gyro drop. As with other theme park, there were many people queuing up. For indoors ride, some have this machine where u can get your queue number which theres time on it, u just have to go on that time to get into the ride straight away instead of waiting. Super experience overall, will go back again. youtube - lolsia2000 for videos when im at there",575,hour

You can buy a day pass, but we got there after 4:00 p.m. so the admission fee was US $17 per person to ride all the rides, and the lines were short. Lotte World has an outdoor part which is sort of like a much smaller version of Disneyland, in California, and two indoor parts which has rides for younger kids. There is even a skating rink on the bottom floor. I rode the big kids rides in the outdoor part which has a castle modeled on the Sleeping Beauty Castle in Disneyland. If you have had enough of palace tours and want to eat cotton candy while looking for some fun, this is the place for some roller coaster type rides. This place is not as big as Disneyland in California or even Six Flags Magic Mountain or any of the serious scary rides in the USA. It reminds me of Ocean Park in Hong Kong.",577,hour

We felt like we are not getting much value for our money, since we did not feel like spending the whole day standing in the queue. In the evening some of the rides were closed even though the place was supposed to be open till late, and for this reason the queues were equally long in the evenings. Moreover, you cannot leave the place and go shopping or do something else for a while and then go back, your one day pass is not valid anymore if you leave the area.

582,227,1529,"Lotte World is divided into three parts: Lotte World Adventure, Lotte World Waterpark and Lotte World Aquarium. I went to Lotte World Adventure and it consist of four levels of indoor adventures and linked to an outdoor theme park called Magic Island. No doubt some of the rides were the main attractions there but the day went I visited was peak, and it was a Monday. They have two types of tickets, Daily Passport Ticket (full day and after 4pm admission) and Admission Only Ticket (full day, after 4pm and after 7pm admission). It gets cheaper for later passes, I advise you to purchase onsite to prevent any mistakes because it includes admission to some other parts like the museum, where I don't know where it that plus you might be give tourists discounts.  During March to April, they feature the Mask Festival where it's a world of fantastic masks along with the vibrant spirit of spring, plus a Masquerade parade at selected timings. The worse part of the trip was most of the rides had to stop at 8pm for fireworks for 30mins. That also means you'll be in the queue before 8pm and queue for 30mins + 1hour or whichever the waiting time for the ride. What frustrates me even more was the staff stopped me from entering and explained to me that there's fireworks but yet allowed Koreans to enter the queue, though there's communication barrier but actions spoke louder than words. That staff even screamed at me as he have to repeat multiple times that I have to wait after 830pm. Bad service!

Partly because he wanted to go because he loves amusement parks, but partly because he also wanted to show us the madness that is Lotte World. As I said, I wasn't sure what to expect, so the closest thing I can describe it to is Camp Snoopy/Nickelodeon World at the Mall of America in Bloomington, MN--except that Lotte World has both indoor and outdoor attractions, whereas CS/NW is purely indoors. The place was PACKED--I think we were there during a school break week--and the line for every ride was at least 3 hours long, so I didn't ride anything but instead just walked around (my dad and brother went on one ride while I sat and read a book, drank a soda, etc.). I can see how this would be entertaining for families/children who live in Seoul and this is as close to Disney as they can get. All of the rides and characters were blatant ripoffs of Disney characters/attractions, but that just added to the kitsch factor, so I was entertained by it all.  It was easy to find, easy to buy tickets, plenty of beverage/food options in the park. Just don't expect to be blown away if you have been to Disney Land/World already...it's not the same.

The price of admission was fair, about $25 per adult if I remember correctly. GET A MAP - this place has so many levels and rides everywhere it would be easy to miss something without getting a free map at the info desk.  We didn't get to go on too many rides as waits were were up to 2 hours on some of them. The ones we did visit were great! Well worth the money just to see the largest indoor amusement park in the world. If I were to visit Seoul again, I probably wouldn't go back to Lotte World unless it was in the middle of the week when crowds would be lessened. The size and detail of the park is amazing, but I only felt it was average for the waits and crowds even late on a Sunday.

Compared to others theme park, this is not worth your time as you have to be patience enough just to play a game. I went here just because it is famous in drama series like Stairway to Heaven, Athena and variety show, Running Man. Second time I went here, it was raining and I can only play indoor games.

I wonder at what point Lotte World Management should stop selling entry tickets - but I guess money speaks louder than patron enjoyment. I think this is extremely poorly managed.

I went there on a weekday and in the afternoon, so it wasn't that crowded yet, but we still waited 30-50 minutes for each attraction. It's not much at all, some people are waiting for few hours during weekends! Also, use your discounts. If you are subscriber on KakaoTalk or share their page on facebook you can get a bigger discount. Because ""foreigner discounts"" are kinda funny.

The Pororo Park (on the basement, same floor with the ice skating ring) provides a special place where toddler can run around freely and enjoy rides designed for their early age. The fact that they limit 2 hours per visitor makes it even better as they get to enjoy most rides without even queueing.

There are several rides that are geared towards the older crowed, but there are MANY rides and activities geared towards the little ones. Singing and dancing, walking characters etc.  This can easily be done in about 2-3 hours.  A place that few people visit is the folk museum in the back of the attraction, but it is really quite interesting and a fun way to work your way through Korean history in an abreviated version (plan for 45-90 minutes here depending on your interest in history).

Just felt that Lotte is overrated. Everland is just so much better!

Our first ride was Sinbad - a subtle and horrific hat-tip to Disney's ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ride. It was fantastically awful, and when I was finally splashed by the water, I expected it to burn through my clothes. Our second attraction was an insect/rain forest mashup that featured lots of empty insect viewing cages and many children that perhaps should have been in some of those cages. Then we ventured outdoors, for the real fun...  ...Of waiting in line for 2 hours for ""Atlantis."" Actually a pretty good roller coaster - the ride consists of going in and out of a man-made mountain, and has two main runs. Again, not bad. However, the other rides (all 8 or so of them) all had very long lines, and we were getting cold, so we ventured back inside.  Our finale consisted of a tea-cup inspired ride that had a large cobra in the middle, and revolved just quick enough to entice the junk food our of your stomach. Not bad, but perhaps a ride to be taken earlier in the day, before food consumption.  Many of the indoor attractions and rides cost a little extra.

Most rides which we wanted to go for like 4D theater and Bumper Car were all closed for maintenance. We queued 30 minutes for the monorail only to realise that it circles the indoor area only, not the indoor and outdoor area as we expected. The hotair balloon ride queue was so long that it says 60 minutes wait so we did not attempt to queue for it.  We wanted fast food fried chicken for dinner and were told that we had to wait for 30 minutes for the chicken to be ready.  Maybe because it was a Sunday night, it was way too crowded, long queues for minimal attractions that were open indoor and long queues for food. Spent 4 hours there but didn't seemed to have accomplished much except doing the Singbad ride, Desperado cowboy shooting, monorail, watched 7pm parade and had fastfood dinner.  The parade was the only more interesting event with a Christmas mood.",598,hour
599,244,1596,"Lotte World is relatively cheap to get in, we got tickets for 29000 won each. You do need to pay for a few rides inside but we felt that was ok. The rides on Magic Island were great, the Gyro Drop was terrifying!  Inside, the balloon ride was lovely, we did have to queue for an hour for it though! The French Revolution roller coaster was incredible, also an hour queue though.  The Christmas parade was one of the best things I have ever seen. A very weird take on Christmas and it was so good I got a bit teary. The actors were amazing and very friendly. It must be such a brilliant job!  Only issues we had were the queue lengths and as we are vegetarian the food. Ye gods, don't remind me of the food.  Brilliant day out though, we had so much fun.",599,hour
600,245,1599,"Wow, Lotte World is expensive. I only went to the amusement park area, and went with a few kids, but the stuffy indoor air and limited number of rides didnt quite do it for me. Now, if you are looking for an indoor place to kill a few hours, it does the trick - but I dont think I'll be returning here unless I have to. On the plus side, at least the food options were not totally overpriced!",600,hour
601,246,1608,"The best part was the price. I went in the afternoon and it was cheaper, plus my bank card gave me another 40% off. Lotte World is small and the lines are super long. There was only one good ride and we had to wait about four hours to ride it. The name is called Atlantis and it does rock. If you want an all day theme park then Everland is more worth your money.",601,hour
602,247,1621,"Had a spare afternoon on a chilly Seoul afternoon, so my girlfriend and I checked out Lotte World and had a ball. I didn't know what to expect from the place (thought it would be a cheap Disneyland knock off), but had a great time on the indoor roller coaster and other indoor rides (flume ride, adventure rides) as well as the big rides out on the island.  So if you do have a spare 5 hours and are in the mood for some good old fashioned amusement park fun, Lotte world is worth a look.",602,hour
603,248,1628,Lotte World gets very crowded in the afternoon after school gets out and on the weekend. It's best to go early in the morning. It isn't that impressive compared to amusement parks in the other countries but it is ok for a few hours. If you have more time go to Everland which about an hour outside of Seoul but even that can't compare to amusement parks in other countries.,603,hour
604,0,226,It was packed with people on the day I went there with my kids but we weren’t waiting in the lines for the roller coaster or anything so it was fine. My kids liked it so much and it’s always a nice place to take many pictures. I had many different cards with me but Master Card was most beneficial to get an on-site discount. I didn’t find this offer anywhere beforehand but was lucky that I had the card with me.,604,anything
605,1,323,"We went on a Friday after Memorial day holiday in Seoul. May have been the most stupid time to go other than memorial day itself.  I paid for 3 tickets on Kloop (ticket collection was far away from the main entrance... A good 10-15min walk after asking 3 different people) and added 5 magic passes to two of those tickets for an extra S$100. What a waste of money. The magic pass system is terrible. Every 15 minutes the system opens to allow time slots to be booked to reserve the ride and skip the queue. It has very limited number of time slots each hour and try as we might, for 2 hours we could not reserve anything. Each time the reservation started... It showed all slots filled/closed about 10 seconds after it opened. Eventually all time slots had been reserved and we had to queue with everyone else. So that was $100 down the drain. We didn't ride any of the popular rides because the queues were 90 to 110mins per ride. We were there for 10 hours (until closing time) and rode 5 rides all day. We thought... Screw it let's pay extra to play the VR games.... But no... There's a height restriction and my girl was 5cm below it.  Also, the stupid parade that they run through the main indoor Adventure land around 2pm will section off large areas which cannot be crossed easily or at all (during some parts of the parade). So don't get separated or you won't be able to return until after the parade ends. And all this online advice about going for the popular rides during the parade I found to be bull crap.... The queues were long and getting longer still...  While my 10yr old enjoyed it, as an adult - I wouldn't wish the experience on my worst enemy. Only a parents love for his kids got me through this day.  Just be prepared to queue. Bring your tunes and your headphones, battery pack for your phones, a portable fan (sweaty queues whether indoor or out), snacks, drinks, and pack light. There are plenty of lockers but they are single use so if you do use them then make sure you keep the important stuff with you. One thing I wish I had was a collapsible stool. You will stand for a long long time at Lotte World in queue after queue. I saw some parent bring a picnic mat for the kids to sit and lie on. She was a local with local knowledge.  Food and beverage prices are not super expensive but nor are they cheap. Expect to pay amusement park prices.  I wish I could say something nice about Lotte World but I can't. I just taste bitterness.",605,anything
606,2,340,"Here is our experience: 3 adults and 2 kids We were picked up at 8.30 from the hotel and taken to Lotte World. The trip took some 60 min and after getting organized with tickets etc it was already 10. We were told to return to the meeting point at 11.20. We all got full day tickets including any rides. After getting familiarized we realized that there were so all Magic tour tickets available allowing to skip the line. Further more also attendants tickets for adults just following the kids around and not doing rides. Cheaper of course. Our 4 year old managed 3 rides and our 12 year old managed only 1 and had to give up the 2nd ride due to too long queue . At 11.23 we were noticed that time was up and time to return either direct to hotel or to a shopping center. We opted for the shopping center which turned out to be a small souvenir shop. Later on I reviewed what we had booked and paid for USD 294 . It was a whole day Lotte World Package Deal. If by any chance Viator or the tour operator read this, our Booking reference was BR-697267984 We were clearly cheated. We had enough other things to do in Seoul so did not do anything about this then. But now thinking back I like to warn others for this. .  .",606,anything

There was an indoor park for children and the outdoor which we didn't get to enjoy because of weather and most rides were closed at that time.

611,7,624,"First off, this is nothing on the scale of Disney, which it seems to want to replicate (Magic Island in place of Magic Kingdom, marching bands and cute characters wandering about for photos). The park is good, but perhaps a little pricey for what it is. The rides are on the same scale as say Legoland. Don't expect anything that will leave you wanting to ride again. There are some food outlets which vary in quality. The high points are the water log ride, the Zombie VR area and the Korean Heritage area. There is a huge shopping mall attached which should suit every need. Annoyingly you would need a more expensive day pass to be able to enter the park, then leave to go shopping, then re-enter later on, even though it's all the same Lotte complex. As the title says, this is definitely not a must see place (I only went on my second visit to Seoul) but if you have a spare day on your itinerary and you like theme parks then perhaps this would be a good idea.

If you do not speak Korean and have a question just ask a staff. NOT a student. There are a lot of student who come for a school trip and they tend to get worried if you talk to them not because they think you're weird or anything. Most Korean people get all flustered if you speak with them. Try the snacks if you're willing to splurge. Try the VR French Revolution or the Haesung Tuk Gup. Its really fast and worth waiting for. You can also reserve you ride with an app. You can reserve up to three rides I believe. Also check the official site for special event discounts. For example if it were Halloween if you have three of the same letter in your name as Halloween you get a discount. Check the official site and bring your ID with you.

Theres a game hall with a lot teddy bear machines which are impossible to get anything from (like in japan) and theres a lot snack booths around selling the same stuff like corn dogs and fired chicken. The only time we were actually prepared to pay for a ride (the hot air ballon thing) an static park worker informed us it would close now because of the park parade which would start in 30 mins, 3 floors down (???!!) which was weird and beyond frustrating after it took us ages to figure out how to get that floor even...Later I was laughed at by Korean friends for even going there and that theres a way cooler amusement park outside Seoul..But the mall itself is nice!",617,anything

Yes, the waiting can get too long but it's no different than in any other popular amusement parks. It is expensive too but the variety of the rides and other games, the pretty views, the shows and the overall magical mood of the place totally makes up for it. There are many cheap restaurants and some souvenir shops inside. Also, if you go to their website, they usually have discounts, especially around holidays (Christmas, Halloween) and for foreigners, also, you can just buy the afternoon ticket.

627,23,1476,"Visited here last Thursday evening (just before a Korean holiday weekend) at 8pm with my girlfriend. Thought the chance to walk around for 17,000 won would make it worthwhile for my first visit, but this is a poor date location. Lotte World was mobbed with middle-school students in their school uniforms taking selfie pictures with every attraction in site. Lines were long even late in the evening, and the indoor section of the park closed down completely from 8:25-9:10 for a ""parade"", which was pretty lame.  Lotte World is pretty old and not that large, though conveniently located in the middle of Gangnam, so considering the value of the land it sits on the park is a reasonable size. The few rides we took (without the long lines) were quite basic... shooting some dragons, a 3D haunted-house movie, and a balloon IMAX movie that my girlfriend found entirely disappointing ... not the balloon simulation that she was expecting. Anything worth riding had a 20-30 minute queue, and just about every line was closed by around 9:30pm, so you just don't get to try anything with the late admission ticket.  For 2 adult visitors, Lotte World was very underwhelming. Avoid.",627,anything

I really enjoyed Atlantis and the Gyro Drop.  On the other hand, the food is really terrible. The vendors don't keep their food at a warm temperature.

Partly because he wanted to go because he loves amusement parks, but partly because he also wanted to show us the madness that is Lotte World. As I said, I wasn't sure what to expect, so the closest thing I can describe it to is Camp Snoopy/Nickelodeon World at the Mall of America in Bloomington, MN--except that Lotte World has both indoor and outdoor attractions, whereas CS/NW is purely indoors. The place was PACKED--I think we were there during a school break week--and the line for every ride was at least 3 hours long, so I didn't ride anything but instead just walked around (my dad and brother went on one ride while I sat and read a book, drank a soda, etc.). I can see how this would be entertaining for families/children who live in Seoul and this is as close to Disney as they can get. All of the rides and characters were blatant ripoffs of Disney characters/attractions, but that just added to the kitsch factor, so I was entertained by it all.  It was easy to find, easy to buy tickets, plenty of beverage/food options in the park. Just don't expect to be blown away if you have been to Disney Land/World already...it's not the same.

I wonder at what point Lotte World Management should stop selling entry tickets - but I guess money speaks louder than patron enjoyment. I think this is extremely poorly managed.

I was hyped at first at the entrance, wondering about the fun rides the park is going to offer but eventually i was greeted with disappointment when i took a look at the park map. Basically, the only fun ride was the Atlantis roller coaster and nothing else is that good. Plus, the place was packed with local students and I had to queue for 3 hours just for the Atlantis ride and trust me it wasn't pleasant at all. By the time we completed the ride, it was already evening. I would say they're trying to emulate disneyland with the castle and stuffs but boy was i wrong, as it wasn't even a ""fun"" experience at all. Rides were below average, some places were not covered with the 1 day pass and of course the massive crowd.

It was absolutely unfair as I have double checked with him before queueing up, he should have let us know right from the beginning before letting us to queue up for so long so that we would get a baby ticket first. We were treated unfairly as no facilitator or sign has told us to get a baby ticket at the entrance nor at the ride. We actually have bought three adults tickets (which costed more) for 2 adults and a baby instead, we have shown the tickets to him, but still he insisted that we have to get a baby ticket instead.

Many many good quality food stalls for families from snack stands to restaurants. Very large area which does have a little for everybody.  Negative points:- *please check your children’s height before going. We do not have particularly small Children (6+9) but we found out they couldn’t ride the majority of the rides. My 6 year old was even too short for the swings! I don’t know if it was H&S but the sizes were strange. We could only go around the video rides, amusement arcades and a few of the street games. It looks like a magical place but we felt very flat. It feels like a cheaper version of Disney, even down to the red bow. It looses something with all the similarities, there are so many. I would have loved it to be more Korean. Street procession was like a Brazil carnival.  Queueing was 100 minutes for one ride and it was a very humid/rainy day which makes me think on a nicer day it could be worse.  One thing is guaranteed, this place will have you haemorrhaging money. We paid W198,000.00 (family of 4)and that was without the added extras like museum entrance. There are also things like “The Mirror Maze”, darts games and other attractions that will cost you extra, you can buy additional tickets next to the rides for these. It’s a very costly day.  We were left disappointed but that was due to the lack of availability for rides for a 6&9 year old, who have visited many parks and ridden the same rides in other areas. The children felt cheated and upset at constantly not reaching the required height knowing they have ridden it before.",637,disappointed

It's confusing place as they do not provide the map at the outdoor entrance. We had to figured out on our own at the end of the day we found the entrance from the mall and the map was there, plus no information to inform the tourist if they were busy with a big tour group.

I don't know about other countries, but in America, disneyland is so huge that it takes a whole day just to cover one section of the park. Compared to the disneyland in LA, lotte world is like 1/10 the size. It's just so tiny and the rides were not really ""thrilling"" at all.

The lines are insane and its very hot inside I'm not sure if they have an air conditioning or its an outdoor with roof. 🙊 but if you really want to go there I suggest that you go after 7pm the ticket prices is much lower and its enough to go around the area and the lines are a bit fast by that time.,645,disappointed
646,11,709,"Maybe cos we went on Xmas eve, too crowded and end up didn't manage to take many rides, perhaps only 4 at most. Our boys from 7yo to 16yo were disappointed. Everland was better.",646,disappointed
647,12,717,We went to this theme park as Everland is a bit far and were not disappointed with what was on offered. We spent the whole day there and only left when the park was closed. Our children love it. We took quite a few photo of Cherry Blossom that lined up the park. Memorable experience. We would recommend it to anyone.,647,disappointed
648,13,731,"If you have been to Disneyland and are expecting something similar then you will be disappointed. However, if you want to spend a day hanging out with your little ones, especially if the weather is bad, then Lotte World has plenty to offer you.  If you do decide to go then make sure you get a discount voucher (available from most hotel lobbies/concierge) - you will find that a 20 percent discount will be offered.  Getting to Lotte World is easy on the MRT. Take the green line and get off at Jamsil station. The MRT signs point you towards Exit 3 (if you go out this way the head towards Charlotte Theatre and you will see one of the entrances/ticket office). Another option will be to head towards Exit 4, but you don't have to leave the underground pedestrian footpath to get to the entrance/ticket office.  It's not obvious, as it doesn't stipulate in English, but a Day Pass ticket entitles you to 3 Fast Passes for rides (although I'm not sure if this applies for Half Day Passes?). There are a few kiosks scattered inside that allows you to chose which rides Fast Passes are available on (normally within 45 minutes and not beyond). Alternatively download the Lotte World app and register your entrance ticket details to access Fast Passes via your phone. I believe that if you can buy Fast Passes if you go beyond the complimentary 3 that come with your day pass ticket.  Once inside it the multi-level and indoor and outside areas require a certain amount of orienteering. Rule of thumb is that the outside area has the majority of the fast/big rides; whilst the inside has about 3 big rides, but mainly caters to the young audience. We went as a family of 4 (two little ones under 7 yrs old), went on most of the rides that the children could ride on (they are quite strict on height), arrived at 1130am and left at 8.30pm. Exhausted.  Lotte World tries hard to imitate Disneyland. There are parade shows and a fairytale castle, but ultimately the lack of recognisable characters (no Mickey and Minnie et al) make them unmemorable. So forget the unmemorable merchandising and just go for the rides.  Lotte World does not check your backpack/handbags so you are free to bring outside food and drink with you.  PS The cherry blossom has just come into season and there are a number of trees surrounding the outside area that make it more memorable than it would be otherwise.",648,disappointed
649,14,819,We visited today with our 1 year old son. We paid 1 ticket for just entry and no rides and the other ticket for rides. My son was free. The lady that sold the tickets advised that there were rides he could go on. That's why we bought 1 adult ticket that allowed us to ride so one of us could ride with him. When we entered there were no rides that he could go on. Adventure land for small children was closed for inspection. All the other rides for small children were closed. We were so disappointed because we wanted to to have some fun as he had been sitting in a pram for a few days while we shopped. We ended up paying for entry to Pororo world which was great! They had little rides that he could play on and little rooms with padding and he had so much fun there but there is a time limit of 1.5 hrs. I was still disappointed in the larger rides as the wait time was sooooooo long!,649,disappointed
650,15,849,"Go there after 4pm as it offers discount ticket. But if you have been to Disneyland or Universal Studio, then definitely you will be disappointed.

Given that you are not distracted by the shopping arcade along the way. It was on a Friday that we went to check it out. It was pretty crowded with tourists, school children and local people. However, the longer queue took only 30 minutes. Our kids loved the theme park, especially the Camelot Carousel, World monorail, kids bumper cars and train rides. However, we were disappointed that the balloon rides for small kids were under maintenance. We suggested family with small kids should do some homework prior visiting. There were rides that need accompany and most of the rides require kids to be above 110cm. It means if you have a 3 year-old, he might not get to play those rides he wants to even with accompany.",651,disappointed

My friend got a credit card discount and the ticket costed him 12 000Won, it would be nice to know about those kind of discounts. We got disappointed because the ticket itself wasnt a full pass, you need to grab at least 30 000Won more to access everything in Lotte world such as Ice ring, Magic jungle, Horror house (or something like that). The amusement park rides looked pretty old from near distance, also there wasn't many of them altogether. Maybe 5-8 rides for an adult. We skipped the rollercoaster right away because of 45min queue. There were two nice rides, so I wont give 1 star.",652,disappointed

Spent most of the time walking around indoor and to the outdoor theme park. We only got on 3 rides. Nevertheless, my daughter aged 7 had a splendid time in Pororo Park which is located in the indoor theme park. Additional entry ticket is require though.",653,disappointed
654,19,927,"Looks great but were unfortunately disappointed, at first it looks really exciting and spectacularly decorated but the rides are quite basic. We experienced a situation here which never before has been experienced anywhere else in the world for us. Both me and the person I was travelling with suffer some medical problems which mean its better to go back to the hotel for a rest and to take medication, also wanted to look around the shops there and get something to eat. We asked when buying a day pass that we needed to do this and the person at the counter said it was fine. When we attempted to leave the staff refused to let us leave and said if we leave we wont be allowed back in unless we pay for another day pass. They were unprofessional and rude, and I was thinking it could be a language mistake. so after multiple questions we demanded to see someone who could speak English fluently, they confirmed this was the rule but this staff member was very friendly and arranged for us to be let in after we left, it was a ridiculous rule as ive been to theme parks all over the world and never not been let out before! Please keep in mind that this is an even more stupid rule because the indoor theme park is a part of a huge shopping complex, and outside the gates are multiple food courts and restaurants, inside the park is a very limited range of food or shops and is also more expensive. The whole complex is owned by Lotte aswell, so I dont know what the problem is in letting people out. It seemed most of the locals had yearly passes so were allowed to come and go as they pleased.  We first noticed on arrival that the staff were very unfriendly, and rude, some even look like life is so painful they would gladly be euthanized if given the option, this was quite disappointing as we came here to have a happy day out at the end of a long trip but ended up being quite downbeat due to their attitude and poor organisation. I was told that this was the Korean way though! Disneyland is the happiest place on earth for a reason and this place doesn't come close!  The park is very hard to find things, you can see a ride that looks interesting but walk around for hours looking for the entrance to it! Staff had no English skills mostly so wasn't any use to ask them. Signage was really bad, Especially bad that very little was in English as-well.  Most of the more exciting rides were closed for maintenance or had extremely long lines so we were forced to go on the less popular ones. The park is clearly a poor copy of a Disney park but it could be so much better with a little work. We were adults but also noticed there werent many rides for younger children, but the Sinbad ride was very good for all ages for people who dont like thrill rides but still want a little adventure with the drops and everything.  The Parades were disorganised but interesting to watch. I would recommend going to Lotteworld if its a less busy day and if you like theme parks, definitely wouldn't attempt going here on the weekend or a public holiday.  The guidebooks say to get off at a certain train station, but again theres no signage to LOTTEWorld, or any map or guide to say where it was or even where the entrance was, was very confusing and we got there later than expected due to this.  Unfortunately poor communication and organisation lets this park down in what could be a really amazing experience. Part of what I liked about it was that it was a theme park in a new country so a new experience.",654,disappointed
655,20,928,"Lotte world has been featured in a number of korean dramas. I went there because I watched those dramas. I was quite disappointed at the scale and the facilities there.

Food wise its good theres various selection.  Jamsil station is right there as well and they have lockers on the train station ..,656,disappointed
657,22,1051,"This theme park has outdoor and indoor area. We went there on weekday and it was super packed with the teenager students whose wearing uniform. Actually not quite sure how the education system here works? But based on my experience not really recommended if you are taking too young kid to this place neither elder due to huge distance also too many floors in the building. It's confusing place as they do not provide the map at the outdoor entrance. We had to figured out on our own at the end of the day we found the entrance from the mall and the map was there, plus no information to inform the tourist if they were busy with a big tour group. We were disappointed with the management team here on careless. Free WiFi here sucks, it doesn't really work mostly unable to connect. Ticket will be cheaper in the afternoon but I don't think I want to be back again, doesn't worth the money.",657,disappointed

If you rarely go to large theme parks, then you'll like lotte world. I really didnt like lotte world because it was so tiny that I could cover the entire amusement park in under 4 hours. I don't know about other countries, but in America, disneyland is so huge that it takes a whole day just to cover one section of the park. Compared to the disneyland in LA, lotte world is like 1/10 the size. It's just so tiny and the rides were not really ""thrilling"" at all. The horror house was literally a 10 minute 3D video for 5 year olds. If you have young kids, then lotte world wouldn't be a bad choice, but if you're over 15 years old, I suggest everland over lotte world.",658,disappointed

We hit all but like 2 rides that those under 100cm could do and we were there nearly all day. We went on a Monday and I think our longest line was MAYBE 10 minutes. We were disappointed that the playground in the Kids Zone was close. It would have been nice to have known that before. We of course had a short tantrum. But it was really great and fun for the littles. There was one ride that was pretty out dated. Fantasy Dream or something. 80's creepy animatronic.,662,disappointed

The lines to go in are long and the rides are ok but they were doing alot of renovations and most of the things were closed off and no access granted to other things..

Most rides are indoor but don't miss the outdoor Magic island rides which provides more options for older children and adult.  The Pororo Park (on the basement, same floor with the ice skating ring) provides a special place where toddler can run around freely and enjoy rides designed for their early age. The fact that they limit 2 hours per visitor makes it even better as they get to enjoy most rides without even queueing. Too bad pororo and all their friend does not come in ""live"" and do their dancing very often (got to see only eddy and crong and my toddler is a bit disappointed).",667,disappointed

690,20,291,"We went in at 10 a.m. which was the opening time but there was already a long queue in front of entrance. Soooo many students since it was summer holidays.  We knew what we wanted to go for so ran to French revolution as soon as we entered. One of the most popular rides. We rode within 10 mins and went on to next one, Pirates ship, managed to ride within 15 mins.  We tactfully chose the rides with shorter queue and could ride many rides for the first few hours. It was possible because I am very familiar with rides and how to go about. If you are to come in in the afternoon, I strongly suggest 2 ways to shorten your queue time.  I am not talking about buying ridiculously expensive fast passes. Something you can do for free.  Lotte world uniquely offer 3 fast access using their own App. Magic pass App. Of course you will want to have more than 3 passes since there are many popular ones but better than nothing.  You first need to scan or manually register your entrance tickets on App. Press reserve ride. Each ride opens up every 15 mins to choose time slot. Within seconds, slots will be gone. It is difficult to explain here. Once you try to use App, you will get the hang of it soon.  If you are not very technical person or have slow finger, I would suggest another way. Know what you want to ride and go there. At each entrance of ride, you will see ticket reservation machine. Simply scan your ticket then it will give out next available time slot. Bring that paper at given time and go to fast pass way.  Only downside of this method is you need to physically go to ride and scan your tickets. If your 3 rides are all scattered around, you need to walk around so much. I suggest you to choose 3 rides relatively close to each other.  Atlantis, French revolution, pirates ship and gyro drop are the must-trys. There were 3 horror houses but I didn't try since my 2 kids were too scared to go in. The most popular one was at magic island which is outdoor. It's a shame that you need to pay 5000 won to go in.  There are many variety of restaurants to choose from. Korean, Japanese, Chinese and burgers...etc. Many stalls sell Lottel world goods and desserts.  Lotte world rides can entertain from toddlers to teenagers. They have more indoor rides than outdoor ones. Perfect for rainy days. We stayed until 4 p.m. and rode most of the rides using App and reservation machines. Without a plan, you could wait for hours for each ride so plan well ahead.",690,much

Never out of choices. A day is not enough. One tip is never buy ticket on site. Better to purchase through online site such as klook or Trazy as you can get almost half price. Also don’t forget to visit the museum. Worth a visit.",691,much

We didn't do the rides, we just watched the shows and walked around.  What I like about the place is there was an indoor part of the park.

706,36,401,Actually everything there is amazing but the problem is all the time crowded and alot of people special after 12 pm but in weekend from when lotte world open until close they accept millions of people to much people and if you need to play sometimes you need to wating like one hour for one game or 2 hour i just suggest to visit there but in weekdays spical in middle of the week,706,much

Best of all, we had fun at the VR area. We oldies simulated hang gliding while the two boys took several turns with their war games. Best to go to Lotte World when it opens at 9:30 a.m. get the best out of the trip.",707,much

Do not pay the full price if you decide to go. Use sites like Trazy or Klook and get your discount passes. (foreign passport holders only). The kids had a fun time but for adults not so much. The only saving grace for us was that we did get some nice photos of the kids. Also, do go early and avoid weekends/holidays if you can.",708,much

Was pretty amazed by the spectacle of the whole site really, rides are designed for kids rather than adults but we found the outside ones a but more adult. Very much enjoyed our day but it was very busy with long lines for all rides. Food and drink was farely priced considering it is a theme park. Is it a must see thing in Seoul, maybe not buy none the less we did have a great day.",709,much

Lotte World has a rather dated feel and look - it was probably the bees knees twenty or thirty years ago, but doesn't seem to have moved with the times. The staff during my stay were impeccable - polite and efficient, if rather lacking in warmth. My double room was comfortable, functional, and equipped with the sort of items that one needs and expects in a hotel of this level, but faded. The wallpaper and carpet looked as though they should have been changed years ago, and the shower over the bath tub was a Heath-Robinson arrangement. The corridor carpets were equally in need of changing, and the space was pervaded by a musty smell, that may be a legacy of the days when smoking was common in the corridors and rooms. I didn't think much of the dining options: a Chinese place on a high floor (which I didn't try) and a buffet place on the second floor (which I did). The hotel lacks a simple coffee shop type restaurant where one can order a simple dish from a menu. There are plenty of better hotel options in Seoul.",712,much

It is lined with cherry blossom trees this time of year, and my wife was in heaven. The mall has a lot of high-end stores and was interesting to visit, but we were there for the restaurants and shops in the lower levels after the walk around the lake.

717,47,527,"I had heard that Lotte World is one of the busiest amusement parks in the world (apart from Disney and Universal Studios parks). So we decided to visit it. Honestly, it's not a good amusement park. I would advise people to not go. I have not been to Everland, but surely it can't be worse. The only reason I can think that Lotte World is busy is that it is in the city centre area beside 3 or 4 big shopping malls, so I guess people who are around find it convenient to visit. But I can't imagine anyone going for more than 1 visit. And I don't recommend that anyone visit it even once.  The indoor part of Lotte World feels like a bunch of mediocre amusement park rides have been shoved into a shopping mall on 3-4 floors. Making matters worse, there is a bit of a bad smell around the space. We went on a few rides in the indoor part (a dinosaur shooting one and a flight simulator one) - they were somewhat copies of Disneyland rides, but not even 1/4 as good.  The outside area of Lotte World was not very big, connected via a bridge over the highway. There is a castle in the middle (copy of disneyland), and the main ""thrill"" rides seemed to be the rides that either go from side to side (like a ricking ship ride) or that spin. We didn't go in tot the haunted house as I read a review to avoid it. We went on a Monday and the wait for those average-looking ""thrill"" rides was 40 minutes. Those rides remind me of old-stlye travelling amusement parks that go to various cities with basic rides. Really there is not much more than that, from what we could see, at Lotte World.  It was a real letdown. We left very early.",717,much

But we couldn't make it unfortunately. There were so many people in Lotte world so we had to wait for a long time like 40 min. per a ride. However, we really really had fun in Lotte cause there are plenty of rides which look cool. Plus, the happiest thing was that we got discount 20% of one-day Free Pass Ticket via Visit Korea Mastercard. We thought that the ticket price is a bit expensive honestly, but my friend found the link of Visit Korea Mastercard so we could get 20% off. How cool! We used the ticket as much as we can.

The problem we found was that it didn't include the three Magic Passes which enables you to skip the queue using either an app or the vending machine outside the ride. Going on Lunar New Year Eve, it was particularly crowded and most of our time was spent in queues. There was even a hot air balloon ride inside (much like a Ferris wheel, really) which had a queue of 100 mins!!! In sum, it was interesting, cute, had some cool VR rides (did the three 'Wild' ones), but it was an exhausting day. PS. Skip the haunted mansion... Wasn't worth the extra 6,000 won.",719,much
720,50,562,"went there during christmas holiday week. not sure if it's due to the cold weather or if it's just the place itself. maybe it's just us. a few rides were closed. those that are open had long lines. lotte world is more of a place to take nice photos. because really it's a pretty place. the parade looks fun to watch. pretty much that's it. the indoor area seems more fun than the outdoor area the outdoor area is basically just a disney-wannabe castle with some rides surrounding it. when we went there only 2 rides were open. so we felt like we wasted our time there.  maybe it's more fun to visit during warmer season. oh, beware of local teens. they have this habit of running around to reach different rides in big groups, and they're unapologetic if they hit you or your child while running.  btw note for muslim travelers. prayer rooms are provided at level 3. it's somewhere behind the cartoon network shop. however there's no halal restaurant or eatery. Iron Bull isn't halal. Pasha has closed, now replaced by Auntie Anne's even though a ""Pasha"" signage nearby still exists. maybe the closure is a very recent event. since no re-entry is permitted, the hungry us had to settle for some fries at nearby Deli Bon.",720,much

We were there 11.30am - 9pm and honestly, only manage to cover the whole indoor adventure park but for outdoor, barely cover 20%. Will highly recommend families to stay whole day. If you wish to visit the Lotte Aquarium or Pororo Park, please arrange separately as the 1 Day pass for your to enter Lotte World theme park, when you exit, cannot re-enter.  I had gone to Pororo Park on 2 other days; 2 hours (this is the limit for the ticket entry price) on each day. The small playground with slide, rooms with Lego blocks and building blocks, Pororo & Friends performance, the big bouncing castle, carousel (only open for small intervals on weekday), ferries Wheel and bumper car are all really fun for both my kids. Although it is more crowded on weekend, the rides are all more frequent, hence don’t really need to queue much. Personally, think my kids had more fun on weekend as they manage to catch more rides during the 2 hours compared to a weekday. And parents with preschoolers, trust me, although it is only 2 hours, it is enough to exhaust them that the kids will sleep early that day!",725,much

734,64,668,"I went here as part of my college university in Seoul, so I can't tell you much about ticketing since it was free for me, HOWEVER I can tell you what to expect inside. After handing your ticket to the people in the front they will return it, MAKE SURE YOU KEEP IT ON YOU BECAUSE SOME RIDES WILL ASK FOR PROOF OF PURCHASE! If you go in the morning I highly suggest hitting the outside rides first, just because it's still cool outside and the lines will be relatively short. For those that have a waist line bigger than 32 inches, some rides might not be good for you just based on the fact that in Asia, many things, including roller coasters are built for smaller people. I am a larger woman, and i was able to ride the bumper cars, the spin guro, the hot air balloons, the carasole, and there were a few others that I opted out of that would be accommodating to larger people. Bring your own food. While there is food in the amusement park, and it is relatively cheap in comparison to parks in the U.S. it is still just amusement food. I ate at ""school food"" which has some good kimbap and ddeokbokki. If you have younger ones, or if you're not good with big crowds then definitely avoid the weekends where it gets pretty packed and the lines get lengthy (it was an hour for the hot air balloons). All in all it was fun, but it is packed. Definitely a tourist spot and workers are decent with English :)",734,much

Didn't go to Everland the week I went as a result of finding out how bogged down with people this place gets.  As I left in the late afternoon, the queue was much worse. There really should be a cap to the number of people they let come into this place.  And whatever yoυ do, absolutely avoid any holidays. Especially the first week in May.",741,much

Follow the entry instructions and make sure you take the passport in which the voucher was registered.  Lotte World itself is crazy busy at any time. Suggest you get there as early as you can. Queues can be lengthy. Download the Lotte World app to receive three magic passes for quicker entry to your selected rides (though wait times can still be more than two hours).  The five year old loved his age appropriate rides. Yes, there is a height restriction and as long as above 110cm, then they are allowed on most of the kiddy rides. They measure you pretty much at each ride (there are a few allowing 90cm).",742,much
743,73,716,"Lotte World really IS the Korean version of Disneyland, and it has a lot of options to minimize the waiting. You can download the smart phone app (Lotte World Adventure), scan your tickets with your phone's camera, and reserve three Magic Passes (per ticket). It is mostly in English (just agree to the usual legalese in Korean to open). When you choose your ride, it will show you the next time available for the Magic Pass. Maps are available in many languages, so English-speakers can manage just fine.  There is an extensive selection of indoor attractions with additional rides outside. The castle and most of the thrill rides are outside. There was a nice balance between virtual rides that offer safe thrills (Fly Venture, Wild Valley, Wild Wing, etc.) and traditional rides like the log flume, several roller coaters, etc. Some hybrid rides like French Revolution were too much for me. We did this when it was cold and rainy, so the indoor location was perfect.  You can eat cheaply at the Lotteria (fast food burgers, chicken nuggets, etc,) or eat at a nice local-style restaurant. There is a variety to choose from with a broad range of prices. The shows are cute and popular, but be sure to check the times. Some only run twice a day, while other shows and parades run more frequently. Pick up the Times Guide.  If you still can't decide if it is a good fit for your family, review the rides and shows online (or in the free app) and see for yourself. We thought it was a bargain for all the fun we had.

We had to search for forever to find the one ice cream shop that was more reasonably priced because it was EXTREMELY hot seeing that it was summer. It's half inside and half outside so that part was super cool. It was my first time seeing an amusement park inside. We ended up finding the ice cream shop. Since it's half inside you could go on a rainy day, but I would suggest going when you can enjoy both parts of the park. There are many rides that are copies of Disneyland so I would compare it to that. Not very thrilling, but everything was very cute. Couples everywhere. Must-go-to if you love amusement parks.

Be sure to get a map so you can navigate the rides that you're interested in. We decided to just pick the thrill rides because we only had a few hours till closing. The queues were an average of 30-45 mins, but the waits are VERY worth it. The thrill rides are super fun we even queued twice for The Atlantis (Magic Island).  There's loads of F&B options and restrooms were conveniently located and very clean.

We went to the little kiddie land and there weren't lines (this is right at opening). However, any of the bigger rides were already at 45 minute wait. We were so over the whole experience by lunch time. It was cold out, but, the lines outside were also long. I saw one line for flyventure at 190 minutes. No, thank you.

And when i say massive, i mean average 1hr wait and this was on a Tuesday and not school holiday period. If you are willing to spend some more money, get the magic pass. It allows you to jump queues.

755,85,808,"Hi!  Lotte world was a last minute decision because we were bored in Seoul after being there for 10 days. And I have to say it was a well spent day:) it is easily accessible by train to jamsil! I went on a Monday and the queue was not too long, probably a 15mins average waiting time! I went from 11am to 6pm and I managed to ride almost all the rides.  Heads up first, for those who love crazy scary rides, this probably will not satisfy you 100%. However, for those like me, who enjoy a moderate level of fear rides, this will be an enjoyable trip! They do have one roller coaster that was said to be the scariest, but I didn't try it so I can't comment. However judging by the speed, loops I saw and the screams I heard, it should be satisfying for any fear-seekers.  The coolest part about this park was that it was indoors and outdoors. I loved the outdoors more cause it had more fun rides there! There was a ride I loved so much I went on it for at least 3 times. Furthermore, they had those cycle sea ducks I always see on korean variety shows that was free!  Overall this was one of the better theme parks I've been! Should give it a shot^^",755,much

757,87,813,"Walking in I was delighted, walking out I was so glad to leave. We went on a Tuesday, got there at 11 (place opened at 9:30), went to the Comet, located in the outdoor section of the park (Magic) which we thought would be like Space Mountain from what I saw online. Wait time said 80 minutes. I would estimate we waited for 2 hours before we got on the actual ride, which was vaguely Space-Mountain-ish and mildly entertaining, but certainly not worth the wait. It was hot, so we went back inside to try to find another ride. All the ""thrill"" (coaster-type) rides listed a 120 minutes wait, which probably meant 2.5 hours. We wandered around inside a bit more (it is pretty cool to look at - they cram so much inside, including people!) until we decided to bail. A complete waste of money. Tried to be Disney but failed in every way. Disinterested employees, rides with too little capacity, signs ineffective (no lie, it took us 25 minutes to find the way back out to the street!). If you must go, don't pay the all-inclusive ticket (48,000 won for adults, barely cheaper for kids), pay the cheaper ticket price, wander around and pay for rides as you go (supposedly you have this option), if you can actually get on any.",757,much
758,88,816,"This was an awesome experience and I'm so glad I went. It definitely feels like Disneyland's younger sister who is much smaller, but still tries to emulate her older sibling. It was fun to go on the different rides and be like...OH this is like Pirates of the Caribbean....or OH this is definitely their version of space mountain. They even have their version of Mickey and Minnie (The Fox's Lotty and Lorry). It was awesome.  Solo traveler: I'm 28 years old, I went by myself, and I had a blast. Definitely something easy and entertaining to do if you're traveling solo, as long as you don't mind being surrounded by teenagers.  Food: I had a smoothie, a Popsicle, and some fried won tons. I thought everything was pretty delicious.  Price: It was like $40 for an all day pass (which means you get to ride the rides). I thought that was well worth it. I only spent about 5 hours there, but I felt like I got my money's worth.",758,much
759,89,819,We visited today with our 1 year old son. We paid 1 ticket for just entry and no rides and the other ticket for rides. My son was free. The lady that sold the tickets advised that there were rides he could go on. That's why we bought 1 adult ticket that allowed us to ride so one of us could ride with him. When we entered there were no rides that he could go on. Adventure land for small children was closed for inspection. All the other rides for small children were closed. We were so disappointed because we wanted to to have some fun as he had been sitting in a pram for a few days while we shopped. We ended up paying for entry to Pororo world which was great! They had little rides that he could play on and little rooms with padding and he had so much fun there but there is a time limit of 1.5 hrs. I was still disappointed in the larger rides as the wait time was sooooooo long!,759,much
760,90,822,"When we were in Seoul we wanted to do an amusement park. We were told there were two good ones and this one was better for younger kids. Since we had an 8 year old that enjoys roller coasters we thought it'd be better to do this one and if we came back in the future to do the other park. We had a great time here.  We took the subway and it was very easy to walk there from the station. This park is about 2/3 inside and 1/3 outside. We did most of the inside and only a few of the outside, as it was raining and when it's wet they close the outdoor coasters. They did open them in the afternoon but not all and we didn't get to do everything.  Inside there are 4 floors. On the top is an Egyptian ride we liked probably best of all with lots of cool replicas and stuff, and a hot air balloon ride which went around the entire inside part. It was a cool view and there was a special tunnel part but the wait was crazy long!  On the 3rd floor was the monorail but it was closed because of the rain. And another ride called Jungle Adventure. The 2nd floor has a fast roller coaster and bumper cars.  The 1st floor had most of the rides from a swinging boat, a water ride with a big splash, carousel, and a ride with a 360 on it. There was a ride called Drunken Basket which was like the mad hatter tea cups at Disneyland.  Below the 1st floor you could see a big ice skating rink, but we did not go down there. I cost extra.  Outside was one of those ride where you site in a big ring around a tower that goes all the way to the top and then drops you (I hate those) in your seat and goes partially back up and does it again a few times. There were two coasters that were closed, a walk through ghost house, a ferris wheel, magic show and more. One part of the haunted house scared/upset my son a little bit with a cat becoming a ghost. There was also a big castle you could walk through outside.  There were several shows/performances with people in costumes. They seemed geared toward little (under 6 crowd) on the first floor. There was a tram that came through and there were ladies hanging off the side like Vegas show girls, very sparkly with exotic outfits. The park has two main mascots, Lotty and Lorry and their faces and likeness were on lots of things throughout the park. There were some animatronics.  They park did have a fast pass type thing called Magic Pass to get a ticket to go to the front of the line at a later time. You constantly had to show your admission ticket to ride things since they have an all day unlimited and a like 10 ride pass. I lost mine but they didn't make a big deal about replacing it, though they said I only get one replacement.  There were a lot of food options with a good amount of variety actually. You could get Korean food, hotdogs, pizza, burgers, Chinese, kebabs, and more. The food we got wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad either.  There were lots of shops to buy things at and we bought some cat ear headbands that my son loved so much he wore the rest of our trip in Korea.  Our visit was such a very fun day. If you have kids under 13, this is a great place to go!",760,much
761,91,828,"Like a mini disneyland hong kong. Spent a day here in the rain - most rides were operational. Indoor ice skating rink was cool but had to pay extra to get in (annoyed but wasn't that much extra). The lotte world adventure ticket is already quite pricey..  Most kids are more suited for kids but we went on the - gyro drop - comet express (really cool rollercoaster ride) - the haunted house (laughed more than being scared) - giant loop (heaps fun)  Be prepared to wait in line, dedicate a day trip here. The fantasy mask parade was interesting to watch - mix of asian and caucasians performing. Families with little kids may be invited to join the performance as well. There was a mirror maze which we had lots of fun in!  Overall a fun day out!",761,much
762,92,830,"We came here in our last 2 visits to Korea. The last was 4 years back. Although our children are teenagers now, they still enjoyed the theme park in last visit. So we decided to go just one more time.  The place hasn't changed much, getting old and still expensive. Nothing fantastic. This time round our children didn't enjoy it.  This place is more suitable for young kids rather than teenagers. Everland is much bigger and better. But this is basically an indoor theme park; so don't expect much.  This will definitely be our last visit.",762,much
763,93,839,"we went with a bunch of kids from 2 to teenage years, and everyone had a ball. so much to see and do, massive ceilings, great musicals and entertainment and you can get a nice meal at a reasonable price. Being from sydney, it's a relief to go somewhere like a theme park without being fleeced at every opportunity. definitely a must visit on your trip to seoul.",763,much
764,94,843,"As it was terribly cold when we visited Seoul, we decided to visit this theme park instead of Everland as it's nearer in location and has a indoor park. The rides indoor are more for children, but when you step outdoor, the rides are much more exciting. Not as great as other international theme parks, but it serve its purpose well.",764,much
765,95,845,"I visited Lotte World during winter and maybe this affected my experience but I couldn't find anything exceptional in this park, the attractions are in the average, the most interesting part for me was that a big part of the park is indoor and you can arrive there directly with the subway, spend time inside and then continue your visit in the outdoor part of the park. In my opinion is a good place to visit if you have children and the weather is not the best, otherway there are much better park to visit.",765,much
766,96,855,"This is easier to access compared to Everland, if you do not want to spend too much time travelling. First of all, spend some time to search out discount coupons which can amount to 50%! There are apps like Coupangs that offer discounted tickets. Prepare to spend time waiting in queue (40 mins to > 1 hour) for popular rides, and there are about 4-5 of them in the outdoor area (not recommended in the winter months as it will be very cold standing out waiting) Indoor rides are mainly for the younger children.",766,much
767,97,860,"This is the Korean version of Disneyland. It's a great place for kids, not so much for adults as there are only a few rides that would appeal to the latter. The admission fee is on the high side considering that if you do not have kids with you, you would be able to complete your tour of the place in about 3 hours. If you decide to take the few thrilling rides designed for adults, good luck with that and I hope your patience is as long as the lines.",767,much
768,98,868,excellent shows and rides. My 4 years old enjoyed it so much we went twice during a 6 days visit to Seoul.,768,much
769,99,871,"This Amusement park is much better than Disney land in Hong kong. It is not really recommended for the kids who are less than 110 cm. In most of the rides, they are not allowed. In some specific, kids rides, you will have to pay little bit extra. For the kids who are less than 110 cm, the ticket price is not very less.  For thrill seeking healthy adults, this amusement park is good. Reach this amusement park before the opening time, so that you can go to the recommended rides. You can buy foods inside.  I have visited this amusement park in 2006,2008,2009, 2013,2014. They change something every year.  Good for healthy adults.",769,much
770,100,885,"After reading reviews from tripadvisor, we decided to go on a weekday to avoid the crowd. Great idea as we could really enjoy games without having to queue. Since we didn't have much time, we were a bit in a rush to do as much as we could, but some attractions are not for every kids, depending on the size. Our 2 daughters only have 2 years difference but one was below the limit size, one was over so for many activities we had to split. Not that convenient. Overall kids enjoyed it (show was pretty lame though) and for us it was nice to see them having so much fun",770,much
771,101,888,"Wow, this place has changed (of course) since the last time I've been here. People compare Hawaii to Jeju Island way down south as Disneyland to Lotte World (a much smaller version) This park has lots of offer for a small amusement park. Great for the family with kids of all ages. There's also a huge skating ring inside as well as rides for older kids and adults outside. Nearby are great restaurants, hotels, and a small lake (Seokchon Lake) which is a nice walk just outside of the park. There are nice coffee shops towards the backside entrance of the park and plenty of parking. It's been 23 years since I've been here but still great!  On the lower side, there's a place called ""Pororo Park"" which is great for younger kids. Pororo is a popular TV animation which comes to life at the Pororo Park. My niece is 4 years old and this place is all she talks about. I can't wait to bring my friends back home in the states to this place. Brings back old memories...",771,much
772,102,895,So yes very much your typical theme park. We gave up waiting in line and left the kids to a full day of queuing. Amazing how kids who are continually bored are prepared to stand around for hours for a few seconds thrill.  Some of the queues were taking up to 2 hours. Outside was much better than indoors but overall nobody would visit again. Geared very much to the local market.,772,much
773,103,898,"Chose Lotte World over Everland due to cold weather and that rides in Everland was not running 100% as the day temperatures were below 0ºC. Distance was also a deciding factor and the fact that Lotte World boast to be the largest indoor theme park in the world attracted us to it.  Fairly easy to get to the park via the Seoul Subway. Ticketing and entry was relatively smooth. Unknown to us, the period when we were visiting coincided with the high school holidays, thus resulting in very large numbers of teenagers. Both the indoor and outdoor rides have an average waiting time of about 90 minutes with some going as long as 120 minutes. Now here is the bad thing about Lotte World or any other theme parks in Korea. Queue cutting/jumping is an accepted practice here. I read about it on some theme parks forums but couldn't believe the extent or severity of it until I was there to witness it myself. Example, the person in front of you will, at some point of time, either by texting on their handphone or shouting at their friends, will ""invite"" his or her friends to join him in the queue. It could be as little as just one person to as much as 10 people. This happens at all the rides and is rampant, even with the theme park officials helping the queue jumpers get to their friend that was already in the queue. It was simply unacceptable and appalling for non-Koreans visitors.  On the way out, meet a theme park official and gave them feedback on the problem of queue cutting/jumping. The theme park was apologetic and understood my frustrations and offered another day of free entry as a form of goodwill gesture. We took up the offer and faced the same problems the next day......... :-(  Connected to the Lotte World is a shopping mall that offers quite an extensive selections of shops and eateries. An alternative for those who wish to take a break from the theme park. Take note though, Lotte World entry passes does not allow for re-entry after leaving the theme park area.",773,much
774,104,899,+ Nice atmosphere. Wide variety of rides from different age groups.  - Most of the indoor rides require additional fees on top of entrance fee. Old-looking and not much changes from my visit 5 years ago.,774,much
775,105,900,"The outdoor park is very small - very limited rides (literally a handful only) so mainly teens are there and each ride is jam-packed - about 70 mins' wait per ride. This is the 2nd last week of November 2013. The indoor park is much better - however, the queue to the 'interesting' ones are long (over an hour) while the queue for small children are more tolerable. Food options in outdoor park is mainly finger food. More restaurant options are available in the indoor park. Big bugbear for me is that your entrance ticket does not allow you to step out of the park at all. Perhaps this is deliberate to get you to patronise from their eateries since there will be much more cheaper and better food options nearby just outside the park. I should not have allocated two days of my vacation to hang around this area.",775,much
776,106,902,"It could've fun and much more thrilling if I were a kid. But since I've grown up too much, I appreciate thriller rides better. Though the park boosts of some rides (ie. bungee drop & gyro drop) the other rides were an ok. It could've been better should I arrived at the park when all the rides are available for us and not under maintenance.",776,much
777,107,903,"I rated it ""very good"" because I'm sure if I was a kid, I'd love it. But I really don't think there's much there for adults, to be quite honest. Everything there is expensive, but you'd have to expect that at a tourist place like this. It was very busy and the line ups for most rides were very sizable, so be prepared to stand in line potentially a LONG time - over an hour wouldn't be surprising.  So if you've got kids and are willing to stay the entire day then you might want to check it out. If you have no kids in your group then I honestly don't think you're missing too much by not going.",777,much
778,108,914,My kids love this place so much. They tried several games indoor & outdoor. Unfortunately some of attraction had a quite long line. The place is quite far from our hotel in Seoul.

779,109,916,"natco holidays review - I have visited Seoul through one Malaysian tour company namely natco holidays last December. I am Korean and I was quite shocked because of its price being offered as it was indeed more cheaper than the one being offered in Korea.  anyways, my itinerary was in this way: Seoul - Mt.Sorak - PyeonChang - LotteWorld - Seoul - Seoul.  I brought my friends from Malaysia, and they really loved it. At Lotte world, there are many amusement equipment. One of my favorite was hurup ride (후룹라이드) which you can take picture (actually, you will be taken a picture without noticing the existence of camera, lol) while you are falling from some high place. The funny thing was, you will be shamed on yourself once you see the picture of yourself. hehe, anyways, overall, i liked lotte world very much. A loooooooooooot of things to enjoy! That is must-go place in SEOUL!!!!  The accommodation was quite nice~ and the meals were also quite nice~ The meals are very nice to eat like Running man TV show~However, it was sooooo cold when we went to PyeongChang.

Will still very much preferred Disney land, so do not set too high of a standard before visiting to prevent a huge dissappointment like we do.

Best to avoid weekends as queue to take a ride takes more than 30mins.",781,much
782,112,927,"Looks great but were unfortunately disappointed, at first it looks really exciting and spectacularly decorated but the rides are quite basic. We experienced a situation here which never before has been experienced anywhere else in the world for us. Both me and the person I was travelling with suffer some medical problems which mean its better to go back to the hotel for a rest and to take medication, also wanted to look around the shops there and get something to eat. We asked when buying a day pass that we needed to do this and the person at the counter said it was fine. When we attempted to leave the staff refused to let us leave and said if we leave we wont be allowed back in unless we pay for another day pass. They were unprofessional and rude, and I was thinking it could be a language mistake. so after multiple questions we demanded to see someone who could speak English fluently, they confirmed this was the rule but this staff member was very friendly and arranged for us to be let in after we left, it was a ridiculous rule as ive been to theme parks all over the world and never not been let out before! Please keep in mind that this is an even more stupid rule because the indoor theme park is a part of a huge shopping complex, and outside the gates are multiple food courts and restaurants, inside the park is a very limited range of food or shops and is also more expensive. The whole complex is owned by Lotte aswell, so I dont know what the problem is in letting people out. It seemed most of the locals had yearly passes so were allowed to come and go as they pleased.  We first noticed on arrival that the staff were very unfriendly, and rude, some even look like life is so painful they would gladly be euthanized if given the option, this was quite disappointing as we came here to have a happy day out at the end of a long trip but ended up being quite downbeat due to their attitude and poor organisation. I was told that this was the Korean way though! Disneyland is the happiest place on earth for a reason and this place doesn't come close!  The park is very hard to find things, you can see a ride that looks interesting but walk around for hours looking for the entrance to it! Staff had no English skills mostly so wasn't any use to ask them. Signage was really bad, Especially bad that very little was in English as-well.  Most of the more exciting rides were closed for maintenance or had extremely long lines so we were forced to go on the less popular ones. The park is clearly a poor copy of a Disney park but it could be so much better with a little work. We were adults but also noticed there werent many rides for younger children, but the Sinbad ride was very good for all ages for people who dont like thrill rides but still want a little adventure with the drops and everything.  The Parades were disorganised but interesting to watch. I would recommend going to Lotteworld if its a less busy day and if you like theme parks, definitely wouldn't attempt going here on the weekend or a public holiday.  The guidebooks say to get off at a certain train station, but again theres no signage to LOTTEWorld, or any map or guide to say where it was or even where the entrance was, was very confusing and we got there later than expected due to this.  Unfortunately poor communication and organisation lets this park down in what could be a really amazing experience. Part of what I liked about it was that it was a theme park in a new country so a new experience.",782,much
783,113,938,"I've visited Lotte World several times over the past 15 years. It really hasn't changed much in all that time. The rides are mostly old school.

The Atlantis roller coaster was actually quite fun.",783,much

786,116,949,"The Lotte brand is everywhere in Korea from supermarkets to fast food to sky scraper apartment complexes covering several city blocks. Lotte also made several cartoon characters to advertise their brands. These Korean cuddly characters cover the walls and wander around in costume in the huge, indoor-outdoor Lotte World amusement park. The sheer size of the indoor portion of the park is amazing. It is eight stories from the ice skating rink at the bottom to the balloon ride on the ceiling, all indoors with carnival style mini rides to fair sized roller coasters. None of the rides compare to a Six Flags experience, but it is INDOORS! This is a huge feat of engineering, but more importantly, it makes it a comfortable experience in the monsoon season, the hot and humid summer or the unbearably cold winters. There are more rides outdoors. My 12 year old son loved the two towers. One is a tower drop, the other is a tower shot. They also have another roller coaster and a few other rides outside. When the weather is good, the outdoor rides make it worth the trip for older kids or ride junkies like me. Overall, it is a great destination for families with little kids or older ones looking for something to do in Seoul. Being in the Army, we get US holidays off that allow us to visit tourist destinations on Mondays while the rest of Seoul is in school or at work. I've heard the lines are longer than an hour for most rides on the weekends. We waited 45 minutes for the indoor roller coaster. The weather was perfect, but the lines were much shorter outdoors. I almost forgot to mention one of the funniest parts of the visit: the translations on the dual language signs! I'm surprised that such a big-name corporation like Lotte must have used an auto translation for their signs. ""No Pregnant While Riding"" ""No Drunken Ride"" were two of our favorite Korenglish quotes.",786,much

The lines are awfully long , and I went there on a regular school day, and during winter. I wonder how long the lines are during weekends? One thing is sure the Seoulites do enjoy their theme park with much fervor. I'm beginning to visualize the lines once the Universal Park opens in Seoul. I enjoyed roaming around the indoor park and watching the Parade and the light show at closing time.

Hotel’s bakery did have much but there’s plenty to eat a decent breakfast at the underground shopping (go downstairs thru the Lotte department store doorway) There’s lotteria, angel in us coffee shop(breakfast sandwich), krispy creme(doughnuts), samsong bakery(famous bread/pastries),odeng place that opens before the mall opens.

Lines aren't long but the wait to get on a ride takes forever.

Going on Lunar New Year Eve, it was particularly crowded and most of our time was spent in queues. There was even a hot air balloon ride inside (much like a Ferris wheel, really) which had a queue of 100 mins!!!

There are good options of food and restaurants there too, but overall, its a mediocre theme park meant for little children and big baby adults. Its not 6 Flags, but it was okay. I highly suggest Everland than this place since the rides do get boring and there are English speaking help but going there once is pretty much enough, unless you wanna check out the out door park, cause thats somewhat fun.",804,much

I was told the queue for the roller Coaster outside was 3 hours long. Everything else inside looked really long too.  The inside section of the park needs some serious updating. Didn't go to Everland the week I went as a result of finding out how bogged down with people this place gets.  As I left in the late afternoon, the queue was much worse. There really should be a cap to the number of people they let come into this place.  And whatever yoυ do, absolutely avoid any holidays. Especially the first week in May.",807,much
808,138,1169,"Never pay full price for entry tickets if you're a foreigner. There are a number of ways to get cheaper entrance tickets and we used Funtastic Korea voucher (received 45% discount). Despite it saying need 1-2 days before getting a confirmation email, I received this within 10 minutes (just ensure bookings are open on the day you want to visit). Follow the entry instructions and make sure you take the passport in which the voucher was registered.  Lotte World itself is crazy busy at any time. Suggest you get there as early as you can. Queues can be lengthy. Download the Lotte World app to receive three magic passes for quicker entry to your selected rides (though wait times can still be more than two hours).  The five year old loved his age appropriate rides. Yes, there is a height restriction and as long as above 110cm, then they are allowed on most of the kiddy rides. They measure you pretty much at each ride (there are a few allowing 90cm).",808,much

We had to search for forever to find the one ice cream shop that was more reasonably priced because it was EXTREMELY hot seeing that it was summer. It's half inside and half outside so that part was super cool. It was my first time seeing an amusement park inside. We ended up finding the ice cream shop. Since it's half inside you could go on a rainy day, but I would suggest going when you can enjoy both parts of the park. There are many rides that are copies of Disneyland so I would compare it to that. Not very thrilling, but everything was very cute. Couples everywhere. Must-go-to if you love amusement parks. We ate at the Lotteria outside before going into the park.",809,much

It is a shame however that unless you're willing to stand in lines of at least an hour, you can't really do much. Any of the attractions that are really worth going on are minimum hour sometimes significantly more. The locals didn't seem to mind and perhaps that's a cultural thing but lining up for an hour then having a five minute ride, only to line up for another hour wore thin very quickly. I could only imagine it with a couple of kids (although again, no local kids seemed to mind from what I could tell!). Steep entry fee but it probably is worth a look just to actually view the place.",812,much

820,150,1306,We had a great time at the park. The teenage boys loved the fast roller coasters and other rides. I'm not for that. I enjoyed the train that took us from the outside park to the inside area above everything. So much to see and do. I'd recommend this to everyone coming to town.,820,much
821,151,1312,If you have children this is great......they will have a great time. Of course it isn't as amazing as disneyland but it is so much fun and isa really big park ......it even has a castle! You could certainly spend a full day exporing even if you dont go on the rides.,821,much

Walk down the skate rink and watch all these future speed skater olympic winners.. Then walk yourself out, cross the street and walk toward the castle, you can enter the beer garden (baden-baden) and enjoy a Kloud (the only acceptable Korean beer IMO) in the sun...",824,much
825,155,1350,"Firstly pop on Google play store and download the app. This is essential as when u get your tickets you can scan them in and it gives you booking slots to reserve places using a sort of que jump system to get on some busy rides quicker. You get a limited number of these but that could save you an hour of queing when it gets busy.  If you're not Korean suggest take passports with you as we found a half price offer for foreigners so we got in 2 4 1 :-) You can buy day tickets easily at the ticket desks.  There's a mix of rides varying from rollercoasters to the very impressive Gyro Swing. Some of the rides you'd expect to be a bit worse aren't (the aladdin one, log flume, jungle ride, bungee) and some of the roller coasters are actually more severe (possibly being designed for smaller average height people they don't always have the best neck support for taller people?). Overall though nothing to complain about. We enjoyed ourselves throughly.  Didn't check re the ice skating if you have to book in advance (assuming so). Massive rink in the centre of the bottom floor.  Earlier in the day is much quieter than midday to evening. Use fast passes sparingly or later on when it gets busy.  Loads of little street food type stalls around that compares favourably to the uk on price for our theme park food plus lots of small restaurants on site. Staff are friendly and helpful.",825,much
826,156,1351,"Lotte world is one of my favorite attractions in Korea. I would highly recommend this place if you want to make some great memories. It's a place for both children and adults. Try to reach lotte world as early as possible in the morning around its opening time. It would be less crowded then. Keep the information guide map handy all the time. It will help you a lot covering attractions more efficiently. As soon as we reached lotte world, we rushed to the roller coaster French Revolution which is on the 2nd floor. In the morning time the waiting queue is small. So, if you want to avoid long queues I would suggest you to grab the opportunity asap. I simply loved this indoor roller coaster ride. It was thrilling as well as super fun. Next, we made a clever strategy and decided to cover the attractions in top to down fashion starting from the 4th floor all the way down to the underland B1 floor. I think that helped a bit avoiding long queues and we could cover our desired attractions quickly. Don't forget to visit the Wild 4D shows wind, valley and jungle in underland B1 floor. It's a super amazing experience. The best among the all was wild wind. And you can skip the other two. After covering all the floors, we next moved on to the Magic land which is outdoor. It also has many thrilling outdoor rides. My favorite of all is Atlantis roller coaster. DO NOT miss this ride if you want to experience a real thrill. Waiting queue is too long but it's worth the wait. My next favorite in the magic land was comet express with rolling chairs. I came out laughing and it was pretty amazing. I truly dont feel that one day is enough to cover all the attractions in lotte world. As per the meals are concerned, we carried our own homemade food for lunch. There are also many and a great variety of restaurants out there. For vegetarians like me, there is a restaurant named ""Lake Pizza"" in the magic land which serves New York style pizza and its super yummy. Do plan a full day tour and avoid rainy days and weekends if possible. Also, avoid going in winter season as many outdoor rides are closed. Don't waste too much time clicking photographs as you might miss some super fun rides out there. Trust me, one day is just not enough. Good luck and have fun!!! :)",826,much
827,157,1368,"I was stationed in Korea and the KATUSA's we worked with took us there. Best experience ever! Three levels of everything you can imagine looking down at the huge ice skating rink at the bottom. The outdoor rides were phenomenal. There wasn't as long a wait in line as most people suggested. The perk of having Korean Nationals as friends, they knew the best time to go. Stay hydrated summer and winter. I'm from Florida and the summers there are much milder. You probably wouldn't die of heatstroke like at Disney, still hydrate. This place is a definite must do.",827,much

My friends and I talked a lot and got to know more things about each other while waiting in line. It was quite fun! And we got to ride a lot of rides. They were really fun, especially, French evolution, Gyro Spin/swing/drop and the Atlantis. (By the way, since these attractions are the most popular I recommend you come early in the morning, when there's not as much as people, and wait in line or get a fast pass!) And, for the people who'd rather shop than go to an amusement park, they can skate at the ice rink or shop at Lotte department store! Coming here was a fun (but tiring- let me tell you that) experience, and I wish go back there soon!",830,much

Lotte World was one of them. We were very surprised at how well everything is organized inside the park. It's a great place to take your kids and play around the ice rink or any of the other attractions inside the park. We took our nephews there and we had a blast!

838,168,1468,We visited Lotte World at the end of our Seoul trip and really enjoyed it. Aim to get there at opening time as it gets much busier later in the day. We visited on a week day and managed to fit in around 15 rides (as opposed to Everland where we only did 6 due to long lines). The food options were quite diverse and reasonably priced. Lotte World has a quick pass system on some rides so make sure you take advantage of it.,838,much
839,169,1479,"I only heard about Lotte World from some Youtube videos. I was so pleasantly surprised that it took less than one hour from Insadong using the metro rail/subway system. You can buy a day pass, but we got there after 4:00 p.m. so the admission fee was US $17 per person to ride all the rides, and the lines were short. Lotte World has an outdoor part which is sort of like a much smaller version of Disneyland, in California, and two indoor parts which has rides for younger kids. There is even a skating rink on the bottom floor. I rode the big kids rides in the outdoor part which has a castle modeled on the Sleeping Beauty Castle in Disneyland. If you have had enough of palace tours and want to eat cotton candy while looking for some fun, this is the place for some roller coaster type rides. This place is not as big as Disneyland in California or even Six Flags Magic Mountain or any of the serious scary rides in the USA. It reminds me of Ocean Park in Hong Kong.",839,much
840,170,1480,Big and lots of attractions for every age. The signage is not very clear so you might get lost easily. Staffs not able to communicate much in English.

The price gets cheaper the later you arrive. Lotte world is like being in some bizarre 80's Disney cult classic. In fact , the place is pretty much a Korean Disneyland as they have ripped off a lot from Disney like the castle and the characters. The rides themselves were mostly aimed at children and families but there were two rides that are worth riding, Pharaohs fury and the Atlantis coaster. Also the indoor lparade is quite spectacular. Other than what I mentioned, the place doesn't have much to do that is worth queuing for.",842,much

The place is huge and trust me , you cant finish it in a day. And it has everything what is required in an amusement park. The indoor portion in mostly like a carnival going on and i thoroughly enjoyed the rides going through dark caves and water. But the best part of it is the magic island which is in open area and the rides are extremely scary and not for faint hearted :)  Do dare to try to highest ride with drops you down like a free fall, plus a round pendulum which oscillates and rotates doubling your scare and the bungee jump plus an extremely scary roller coaster.  This place is fun beyond words. :):)",843,much

Partly because he wanted to go because he loves amusement parks, but partly because he also wanted to show us the madness that is Lotte World. As I said, I wasn't sure what to expect, so the closest thing I can describe it to is Camp Snoopy/Nickelodeon World at the Mall of America in Bloomington, MN--except that Lotte World has both indoor and outdoor attractions, whereas CS/NW is purely indoors. The place was PACKED--I think we were there during a school break week--and the line for every ride was at least 3 hours long, so I didn't ride anything but instead just walked around (my dad and brother went on one ride while I sat and read a book, drank a soda, etc.). I can see how this would be entertaining for families/children who live in Seoul and this is as close to Disney as they can get. All of the rides and characters were blatant ripoffs of Disney characters/attractions, but that just added to the kitsch factor, so I was entertained by it all.  It was easy to find, easy to buy tickets, plenty of beverage/food options in the park. Just don't expect to be blown away if you have been to Disney Land/World already...it's not the same. But it is still entertaining and a fun place to people-watch at!",853,much

There are a lot of games and attractions that are not included into 1 day pass, it gets frustrating when you already get excited about going somewhere... and it requires separate ticket line and payment. A bit too much food places as well, but it is understandable - food is everywhere anyway =)) All in all, it's worth seeing if you have some time and money to spend and aren't much of adrenalin junkie.

My favorite sight was the hotdogs from the Korean Dramas. I was like, ""Woah!!"" My favorite snack is the ""Magic Potatoes"", which are the whirly potatoes that you see in the markets and street foods. (I think it's a bit more expensive in Lotte World, but I'm not sure.) The ride types include; the sudden drop, the hammer-like swing with a circle of people, indoor rides with animated features, etc, all in the outside section.  On the inside, there are; ""hot air balloons"" that go around the ceiling and you get to view the whole inside from above, an illusion art museum, and ""adventure rides"" (smaller rides with animated features on the inside).

I went there on a weekday and in the afternoon, so it wasn't that crowded yet, but we still waited 30-50 minutes for each attraction.

Initially we wanted to go to Everland, but given the time constraint, we opted for Lotte World instead. Most of its attractions are indoor (pity that we didn't try outdoor as we spent too much time inside). Even spent half day inside, we still didn't manage to cover most of the indoor attractions due to queuing for some rides. Lucky that we went on Monday where queues were not too long. I had so much fun riding the rides with my little nephew, and to see that he enjoyed so much he refused to leave. There is a nice parade show twice a day, but we missed the garden show & laser show.

866,196,1594,"I was at Lotte World after 4pm (following a tour package) on 16 December with my 10 year old kid. As it was cold outdoor, we stayed at the indoor themepark area. Most rides which we wanted to go for like 4D theater and Bumper Car were all closed for maintenance. We queued 30 minutes for the monorail only to realise that it circles the indoor area only, not the indoor and outdoor area as we expected. The hotair balloon ride queue was so long that it says 60 minutes wait so we did not attempt to queue for it.  We wanted fast food fried chicken for dinner and were told that we had to wait for 30 minutes for the chicken to be ready.  Maybe because it was a Sunday night, it was way too crowded, long queues for minimal attractions that were open indoor and long queues for food. Spent 4 hours there but didn't seemed to have accomplished much except doing the Singbad ride, Desperado cowboy shooting, monorail, watched 7pm parade and had fastfood dinner.  The parade was the only more interesting event with a Christmas mood.",866,much

Food are easily available around, though I hope that there are a greater variety for fast food. This is very important because of the terrible queues that plague every theme park. One can save plenty of time if he queue and eat at the same time.  The entire place is quite compact but yet spacious enough to avoid being claustrophobic.

The French Revolution roller coaster was incredible, also an hour queue though.  The Christmas parade was one of the best things I have ever seen. A very weird take on Christmas and it was so good I got a bit teary. The actors were amazing and very friendly. It must be such a brilliant job!

870,200,1620,"The potential for a great day is definetly there as long as you wisely choose when to go, Korea is a small country with a huge population so land is not abundant and also at a very large premium compaired to other countrys so places are just smaller and more compact then westerners are used to.  As a result this place can get seriously crowded making a 1-2 hr wait for the rides more the norm rather than the exception. To greatly enhance your experience go during the week and go early in the day before the crowds build up and the lines get long (Tip*** A common trait among Korean people is that they DO NOT like to get up early when not working so use this to your advantage***)  The park is in two parts, they have an outside section and an inside section, Although the park is open year round, Seoul can get bitterly cold during the winter months so it is of course much more enjoyable during mild weather as some of the best rides are located outside.  Admission is relatively inexpencive at 24,000 Won for adults (Aprox $22 USD) and you can often cut that price in half as many half price coupons are available on the various forigen travel sites, as well as area hotels, and local english magazines and newspaper publications you just have to look....",870,much

Overall the rides were pretty good, but not special enough to make a trip there if you don't have too much time in Seoul.",872,much
873,0,256,"So we decided to book a ticket to lotte world during our vacation to Seoul, but I was really disappointed about the park. Having been to Disneylands, I would say lotte world is not even close to being as good as Disneyland. I was hyped at first at the entrance, wondering about the fun rides the park is going to offer but eventually i was greeted with disappointment when i took a look at the park map. Basically, the only fun ride was the Atlantis roller coaster and nothing else is that good. Plus, the place was packed with local students and I had to queue for 3 hours just for the Atlantis ride and trust me it wasn't pleasant at all. By the time we completed the ride, it was already evening. I would say they're trying to emulate disneyland with the castle and stuffs but boy was i wrong, as it wasn't even a ""fun"" experience at all. Rides were below average, some places were not covered with the 1 day pass and of course the massive crowd. I don't blame the crowd, but rather how small the park is to accommodate the large crowd.",873,nothing

876,3,291,"We went in at 10 a.m. which was the opening time but there was already a long queue in front of entrance. Soooo many students since it was summer holidays.  We knew what we wanted to go for so ran to French revolution as soon as we entered. One of the most popular rides. We rode within 10 mins and went on to next one, Pirates ship, managed to ride within 15 mins.  We tactfully chose the rides with shorter queue and could ride many rides for the first few hours. It was possible because I am very familiar with rides and how to go about. If you are to come in in the afternoon, I strongly suggest 2 ways to shorten your queue time.  I am not talking about buying ridiculously expensive fast passes. Something you can do for free.  Lotte world uniquely offer 3 fast access using their own App. Magic pass App. Of course you will want to have more than 3 passes since there are many popular ones but better than nothing.  You first need to scan or manually register your entrance tickets on App. Press reserve ride. Each ride opens up every 15 mins to choose time slot. Within seconds, slots will be gone. It is difficult to explain here. Once you try to use App, you will get the hang of it soon.  If you are not very technical person or have slow finger, I would suggest another way. Know what you want to ride and go there. At each entrance of ride, you will see ticket reservation machine. Simply scan your ticket then it will give out next available time slot. Bring that paper at given time and go to fast pass way.  Only downside of this method is you need to physically go to ride and scan your tickets. If your 3 rides are all scattered around, you need to walk around so much. I suggest you to choose 3 rides relatively close to each other.  Atlantis, French revolution, pirates ship and gyro drop are the must-trys. There were 3 horror houses but I didn't try since my 2 kids were too scared to go in. The most popular one was at magic island which is outdoor. It's a shame that you need to pay 5000 won to go in.  There are many variety of restaurants to choose from. Korean, Japanese, Chinese and burgers...etc. Many stalls sell Lottel world goods and desserts.  Lotte world rides can entertain from toddlers to teenagers. They have more indoor rides than outdoor ones. Perfect for rainy days. We stayed until 4 p.m. and rode most of the rides using App and reservation machines. Without a plan, you could wait for hours for each ride so plan well ahead.",876,nothing

We wanted to go on the hot air balloon ride but the queue was 2 hrs. We queued for about 1/2hr for the monorail ride but because it’s winter, half of the ride route was cancelled, so, it was a very short one.  Some nice photo ops outside at the Disney looking castle, so, make sure you go out of the building & walk around a bit.

Really disappointing, also didn't help that the staff didn't speak a great deal of English, so when we did ask about the tickets they had said that it would cost nothing for our 2 year old and what we understood as we could go on 4 rides for free was actually he could go on those 4 rides for free if we buy the all inclusive ticket. Getting between the different levels is also very confusing, the lifts don't all go up and down to all levels only certain levels so we walked around in circles for ages trying to work out how to get to different areas.",882,nothing
883,10,624,"First off, this is nothing on the scale of Disney, which it seems to want to replicate (Magic Island in place of Magic Kingdom, marching bands and cute characters wandering about for photos). The park is good, but perhaps a little pricey for what it is. The rides are on the same scale as say Legoland. Don't expect anything that will leave you wanting to ride again. There are some food outlets which vary in quality. The high points are the water log ride, the Zombie VR area and the Korean Heritage area. There is a huge shopping mall attached which should suit every need. Annoyingly you would need a more expensive day pass to be able to enter the park, then leave to go shopping, then re-enter later on, even though it's all the same Lotte complex. As the title says, this is definitely not a must see place (I only went on my second visit to Seoul) but if you have a spare day on your itinerary and you like theme parks then perhaps this would be a good idea.

It's modeled after Disneyland, but is an obvious fake, but entertaining to see nonetheless.  We managed to visit with an online 50% off deal for foreign passport holders for 24,000 Won each (about $20 USD). So for that price, it was a fine thing to do. The wait for rides was 60-90 minutes in the heat with nothing to look at, not like at Disneyland where the lines are even an immersive part of the ride.  Atlantis was a great ride that we did twice. French Revolution was so jarring that it gave us all mild concussions. The wait for the hot air balloons and the Comet Express were 70+ minutes, so we skipped those. We knew we were visiting Tokyo Disneysea a few days later, so we felt we had all gotten our $20 worth and called it a day after 3 rides that took about 5 hours to complete.  So if this is the only amusement park you can get to, it's fine.

896,23,1350,"Firstly pop on Google play store and download the app. This is essential as when u get your tickets you can scan them in and it gives you booking slots to reserve places using a sort of que jump system to get on some busy rides quicker. You get a limited number of these but that could save you an hour of queing when it gets busy.  If you're not Korean suggest take passports with you as we found a half price offer for foreigners so we got in 2 4 1 :-) You can buy day tickets easily at the ticket desks.  There's a mix of rides varying from rollercoasters to the very impressive Gyro Swing. Some of the rides you'd expect to be a bit worse aren't (the aladdin one, log flume, jungle ride, bungee) and some of the roller coasters are actually more severe (possibly being designed for smaller average height people they don't always have the best neck support for taller people?). Overall though nothing to complain about. We enjoyed ourselves throughly.  Didn't check re the ice skating if you have to book in advance (assuming so). Massive rink in the centre of the bottom floor.  Earlier in the day is much quieter than midday to evening. Use fast passes sparingly or later on when it gets busy.  Loads of little street food type stalls around that compares favourably to the uk on price for our theme park food plus lots of small restaurants on site. Staff are friendly and helpful.",896,nothing

It is also the first time I saw a theme park maximize its space by offering attractions from the basement to the 4 floors it occupies, then to the ceiling! A major drawback is that the place only uses Korean in all of its rides and attractions. It would really help a lot if the stories during the rides have at least written translations in English, Chines, and Japanese.

Although it is great for the kids too. I just loved seeing the kids having a ball. The ice rink in the centre of the ground floor was awesome, we watched loads of little kids getting their skating lessons. We got a suprise at night when the laser show started. We had no idea it was coming and there were pyrotechnics, a huge screen telling a story and massive flames around the centre, and of course we had no idea we were standing right next to one and got the fright of our lives. The outdoor part was fantastic. We went outside at night time, so some things were closed but still great. Live bands; the list just goes on and on. This place is fantastic and I highly recommend it. The variety of activities to do is endless. Let your inner child out and have a ball. We never made it to all the shops but they looked great. You can easily spend a whole day here.
