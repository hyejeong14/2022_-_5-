15,15,214,"Kyobo is a chain, so there are stores all over Seoul, but the Gwanghwamun location is my favorite. They sell books and CDs, which reminds me of what the States used to have in the Borders chains, along with even more stuff. There are cafes and restaurants inside, too. There are sections for foreign languages and, depending on your language, there are likely specialty shops elsewhere that will better serve you. The English section is small, but has great editions, like Oxfords World’s Classics, at cheap prices. The literary selection tends to be canonical, but the staff also has a large section devoted to best-sellers and newly published material, most of which is non-fiction, that is a sort of Korean-American cultural filter. There are always lots of families here and people milling about, reading, gathering books, enmeshed in the written word and the real world. Take some time here, slow down, observe, read something, think a few connected thoughts, have something to eat or drink...and enjoy.  Over the past five or six years, there has been lots of renovation in the areas adjacent, particularly with high end restaurants and shops behind Kyobo and to the left. Jongno has remained the same and the Gwanghwamun Gwangjang is historical. Several years ago the Korean people protested then President Park Geun-Hye with candlelight vigils and songs on the square, every Saturday, for months. These protests began with small numbers that grew into the thousands, and arguably millions. These protests were part of the success in the removal of Park (December, 2016) and were amazing representations of the civil, non-violent assemblage of people for a cause. Democracies around the world would do well to follow in these Korean footsteps.",15,staff
16,16,227,I always make it a point to stop by and inhale the scent of new books. It's a bit short on space to sit and read but the atmosphere is cozy and the staff very helpful. Plus it's right of the square. Great location,16,staff
17,17,259,"I always make a visit to the bookstores of any city I visit, because I am keen to collect cookbooks written in English by locals. Most of these are usually not available on Amazon or other online bookstores.  Kyobo's outlet at Gwanghwamun didn't disappoint. It's large and sprawling, but most of the books are Korean, which is to be expected. As with most brick and mortar bookstores these days, they have cafes, retailers selling pens, art supplies, bags and others to provide some added attraction.  They have a respectable English cookbook collection, but also a selection of books on Korean topics in English. There were some locally written cookbooks, and they looked interesting because several of them were written by well known culinary academics. When I was there in November, they had a promotion on Japanese books and you can enjoy a discount on them. They had also put up a nice display featuring a mix of Japanese cookbooks. I really like this feature.  What I enjoyed about the bookstore was the chairs and benches they had provided within the store to allow people to browse their selections. There are staff there who speak simple English. They have a green practice of charging for carrier bags (which is good).  I'd go back there to check out the cookbooks again. Kyobo is more like Eslite in Taipei (another fabulous bookstore) in its offerings of books and other related products. Kinokuniya in Tokyo is more like the traditional bookstore with a lot more focus on providing books and less on other goods. All are great bookstores, and deserve visits by book lovers.",17,staff
18,0,75, It smells like a book and I love it Due to Corona the number of seats available has decreased ,18,number
19,1,85,Decent selection of books in English Small music section including a limited number of lps Good stop for expats,19,number
20,2,97, Burger King is so delicious these days Its great that the number of stores has increased compared to before Especially the french fries  ,20,number
21,3,120, Staff aggressive and unfriendly I said yes because I asked if I needed a receipt I want to enter a number So what number is it Hani Need a cash receipt I asked again I said yes so I had to enter the number ,21,number

23,5,216,"Kyobo bookstore in Jongno-gu (near Gwanghwamun station) is a must-visit for anyone with a passion for books and simply spending time in bookstores. This particular branch (there are others dotted around the city) is, I believe, the largest. It has a vast collection of books in Korean, and sections for a number of other languages, with quite a good selection of books in English. The store also has a stationery section, puzzles and a cafe, and is surrounded by a number of other shops. Unlike so many bookstores these days, Kyobo allows you to spend time simply sitting on the provided comfortable benches, and reading. You'll find the store in the basement, accessible from the station.",23,number
24,6,225,"Lovely bookstore - you can just find almost anything you need. I went there for a TOPIK book. But also there is an unspeakable number and shape of post it and other sorts of stickers which I also find amazing along with the kids. Staff is friendly and helpful. There is a restaurant there, if you get hungry after having browsed all the stuff. Every time I come to Korea I visit the bookstore, I like it this much.",24,number
25,0,14, Thank you for the book you want to purchase However I had already scanned the barcode with the kiosk and paid but I was a little dissatisfied with the system in which purchasing a kiosk was meaningless ,25,little
26,1,84, I recently visited Kyobo Bookstore Its a little different from before but it seems to be getting better Not only books but also stationery are available in a wider variety than before so it was nice to see a lot ,26,little
27,2,138, A place where reading a book reminds me that Im going a little further ,27,little
28,3,160, Childrens Corner It would be nice if an older man could speak a little more kindly ,28,little
29,4,190, Its my favorite space It would be nice if the types of books were a little more diverse but there must be physical limitations ,29,little
30,5,199, There are many types of books but old books feel a lot of touch so I am a little reluctant to buy them ,30,little
31,6,235,"This place is more than a book store. It is more like a mini-shopping center where you can find not only stationery, books, electrical appliances, gadgets but also toys and bags (Hottracks is inside too). They provide small benches here and there for customers who like to linger around for a little bit. If you are hungry, there is a food court.  The store is definitely an excellent place to fend off the afternoon heat and torrential rains. It could get really crowded because of that and also the fact that it is connected to the subway. I have also been to the one in Daegu, too. The Daegu store is smaller and not as crowded.  If you decide to do some serious shopping there, make sure that you bring your passport with you for the instant tax returns / credits (spending 30000 won at one time). It would be nice if they have a coffee shop there, just like the one in Barnes and Noble.",31,little
32,7,250,"That's a great place to spend hours and hours. They have tons of books of all areas, korean, japanese, chinese, english and even other languages. They also have a great magazine section. There's also right around there - this is not Kyobo, but it's right in there, I even got lost in the boundaries lol- a great stationary shop, i guess my favorite in Seoul; a CD/DVD store in case you are interested in some films or some kpop stuff; some small electronic shop (i bought instant films there); a cosmetic store... it's all there! Restrooms and water fonts are clean and big - as they usually are in Seoul, actually. And, what surprised me the most, there's a quite small food court, but very efficient, with a little more than a dozen choices of dishes, my friend and I tried some of them and they were all delicious! There's also a baskin robbins for some dessert, a dunkin' donuts and some coffee shop I don't remember which. It's all set for you to spend all day drowned in books, or even if you are coming for any of the attractions in gwanghwamun and decided to take a time off to chill a little bit.",32,little
33,8,253,"I love wandering through this book store. The have a decent section of English books and around the outside you can find anything from pens and notebooks to candles, watches, and cool little knickknacks.",33,little
34,9,255,so love..this place....many many books and also other little stalls inside the book store. More korean language book as well. A huge area just for stationeries as well...,34,little
35,0,23, Not much has changed since I was a kid I felt like it was smaller than I expected In the past it felt like collecting and selling luxurious brands but now I feel like Im just bringing in miscellaneous things and ,35,much
36,1,33, After much effort I went to Gwanghwamun and stopped by Kyobo Bookstore to shop for books while waiting for my appointment time Books and people are overflowing ,36,much
37,2,63,Huge bookstore offers a wide variety of literature on pretty much categories even on foreign material Unfortunately literature about cycling is not available  take care its a bit cold down there,37,much
38,3,99,Nice place but the air refresher is too much to handle,38,much
39,4,220,"There is a huge variety of books here, in fact same as similar shops everywhere in the world. Possible to find books in English, one good plus. For stationary materials, it is better and cheaper to enter smaller shops specific for stationary. You will lose much less time. Same is valid for other goods such as souvenirs, wallets, bags, toys, etc. If you want to buy only book and have specific list, enter and buy. Otherwise you can become crazy in crowd. As a summary, other than huge variety of books, nothing special.",39,much
40,5,224,"This bookstore could give Taipei’s Eslite a run for its money. It’s really big with everything from books and stationery to music and lifestyle items and gadgets. Quite a wide selection of English books too. But it was really really crowded on a Sunday afternoon. Great place for browsing and buying, but not so much for hanging out and reading.",40,much
41,6,225,"Lovely bookstore - you can just find almost anything you need. I went there for a TOPIK book.

42,7,226,"I made it a point to go there each time I visit Seoul. One of the main reasons was to buy the same book in Singapore, it cost almost three times as much as the amount I paid in Korea. I usually get the Korean language books such as the ones published by TTLK books as they sell it online in USD excluding shipping cost. I also like to look at the various merchandise ranging from stationery to audio accessories and sometimes, you may get good buys.",42,much
43,8,228,"For me as a book lover, this place is a must visit regardless if they mostly have Korean books, it;s just a MUST VISIT. They even have Japanese selection of books! Though the English section was I guess not that big but there is! You can see almost everything in this huge bookstore, they got the record bar and gadget section and so on, the place is not much of an English friendly place though, but we managed by talking to some customers they are very helpful when it comes to speaking English.",43,much
44,9,232,So much to choose from Great feel Huge wooden table to read at Lots of variety and English books available too,44,much
45,10,240,"Who doesn't love a good bookstore? The Kyobo Bookstore has been around since . . .well, forever, it seems, and it still pulls me in every time I visit Seoul. The selection of books in Korean is vast, but there is also a very good selection of books in English, both fiction and non-fiction. I never have any difficulty finding something. But even if you are not in the mood to buy, this is an excellent place to kill some time.  They have increased the floor space devoted to things like stationery and gifts over the years, but books are still at the heart of what they offer. The stationery section is substantial, and anyone should be able to find something here, from Moleskine notebooks to cutesy pens to everything in between. There is also a mini food court in the corner where I had a surprisingly good bowl of bibimbap (stainless steel bowl, sadly, not stone).  There are lots of places to sit in the book area, and pretty much every one one of them was filled with someone reading a book (or doing something on their phone). I can't say how many books were being bought (except the ones I bought), but there was certainly a lot of reading activity going on. The vibe in the Kyobo Bookstore is always a lively one. It has a good feel, a good selection of books and other merchandise, and a good location. Check it out.",45,much
46,11,247,"It is the place to see how much people in Seoul love to read! Many cute stationery and gifts to buy, too.",46,much
47,12,248,"we pop in after visiting Gwanghwamun Square and this place is massive!  for singaporeans, you can relate it to kinokuniya (jap bookstore) that we have in sg and kyobo is almost as big as kino or maybe kyobo is twice in size?  there are a wide array of books, mostly in korean though, there is some english books and magazines around.  but the thing i'm keen is the vast variety of stationery they have! As i'm a part time student so i naturally have a soft spot to their cute monthly calendars, stickers, korean cartoon related stationery, pens, etc. they are good for souvenirs if you have friends who are still studying or working in office.  Especially in the chilling autumn weather, Kyobo also sell heatpack at 500won each (~SGD $0.60) and this could last about 10 hours. as a tropical kid, i really cannot stand cold weather, so i bought 10 packets of heatpack at one shot. ^ ^ the cashier did look at me strangely though..  *i seriously think korea heatpack is much larger, warmer & better than those i bought from Singapore Daiso. So this could be an alternative for those looking for heatpack in Korea.  come in to take a look and absorb the books culture in korea. i feel this place kinda brings me closer to being a part of korea, than being just a tourist",47,much
48,13,252,This review is for Gangnam location since I couldn't find one on the trip advisor. We were looking for a couple of books for our kids to learn Korean but found so much more. They have great deals and amount on toys and many small things for gift ideas. Kids enjoyed looking around and throughly enjoyed about 1 to 2 hrs there.,48,much
49,14,260,"As a book store ,there are many shopping things for you.However there also the best book store in South Korea because of so many books for everyone.And Korean people take care of their children so much that many children with their parents here.Some foreigners also here to buy books,English books and others.All the way,you can come here to find your book.",49,much
50,15,263,Spent a whole afternoon in the book store. Has best stationery items. I like the reading area very much. It is part of the places to visit every time I am in Seoul.,50,much
51,16,267,"Whether you speak Korean or not (do not panic, there is a massive foreign books selection, especially in English) this establishment is a real must for book lovers.  Obviously 60% of the bookstore is made by Korean titles, but even then, the English and other languages sections are well fed. Besides, there is a incredible huge stationery section with plenty of notebooks ( with much more diversity than the sheer Moleskine you find in any bookstore); and the Hot tracks, a CD and DVD store.  It is a pity this bookstore is in the basement of a massive building and not facing the street. Besides, the signalling to get to the bookstore is virtually non existent.  But anyhow, a very recommendable stop in a very central location in near the palace Gyeongbokgung.",51,much
