11,11,268,"Magnificent views across Seoul. Currently, still being influenced by Covid, there were no waiting times at all. Elevators bring you in lightning speed to the 119th(?) floor. From there a video show starts and ends after ~1 minute with a breathtaking view over Seoul. Afterwards you can stroll around freely on all 5 levels above, including a small cafe with reasonably priced coffee and other drinks. Even a small shop with gifts / souvenirs is available, if you are into those kind of things.",11,wait
12,12,275,"The Mall itself is huge and impressive, therefore i´d give 4 stars. Together with the tower actually only 2 stars. Even you buy the ticket in advance there are long waiting cues (over 1,5 hours). Then on top there are just some small cafes (nothing special) and souvenir shops. The view is nice but really not outstanding. Only good thing there is the short elevator drive and enjoying a cocktail on top.",12,wait
13,13,279,"the highest tower in Korea, you can see Seoul from the top. it really deserve a visit.  however, consider the queue on the elevator to the top floor. I suggest that you just go after opening time in the early morning so you can avoid the waiting time.  I really liked the gift shop on the top floor.",13,wait
14,14,289,"Incredible views, no doubt. However, zero information about the building. A 2 hour wait in a boiling, non air conditioned room will suck the excitement out of the activity. Nothing to do upstairs and the terrace is totally closed off so it’s not any more interesting than looking from the window.",14,wait
15,15,295,"We were very excited to visit Lotte World and Lotte Mall, we got Lotte world tickets before they open to void the long lines and it worked, we were able to go to different rides without waiting for long time, definitely it is a great place to visit with kids. Lotte Mall, was the most beautiful place I ever visit!!",15,wait
16,16,299,"I am puzzled by the review I just read. I thought this was a great observation deck, and they spoke English very well. They answered all of my questions. And most observation decks I have been to have very few elevators. And some sort of wait. It took all of 10 minutes to get to the top for us, and it started out with a bang. The digital wall reveal is amazing. The outside deck was scary fun. All of the electronic assists, in letting you know what you are looking at was great tech  A bit on the pricier side, but still cheaper than The Empire State Building or 30 Rock.",16,wait
17,17,300,"1. the mall is like any big mall in Korea, nothing special I think  2. my review is about the tower: positive: - outstanding View from the 117th to 121th floor, about 500m -> for that 1 point  negative: - expensive, adult 26000 Won per person - it took more than 70 min to get upstairs, all the procedures like security scan, taking photos to sell them later, just endless waiting in several rooms without a window, the air condition was turned on in stand by modus, there was just simply not enough refreshing cool air coming out of the aircon, nobody of the staff cared, you just were pushed through all the rooms like a herd of sheep There were no information about the waiting time. If i had knew that then i would have paid the fast check in ticket which costs 50000 Won.This is outrageous expensive but in retrospect worth it. Of course first of all you must afford this price. Everyone who is able to do it should do it because when you stand in the queue for about 50 min and you see the fast tracker who paid more because they „knew“ and they are passing through the middle line to the elevator then the damn legs are hurting even more and you are still not in the elevator. Because they skip the queue, the waiting people have to wait longer, maybe your spot in the elevator was taken by one of the high payers. - show room was closed - the outside terrace was closed - the service and the staff processes have to optimize a lot I think - started at the end of the queue at 16.30, to see the Sunset. We arrived round about 17.45 in the 118th floor. Then it was dark night. The windows are reflecting the inside light so the pictures you make are always with co-displayed with people around you - downstairs same procedure: another QUEUE, the second one. A little bit faster downstairs, round about 45min, but still too much time lost. The sightviewing floors are big enough, there was no hustle, so the main problem was the ONE and ONLY elevator (of obviously 2) which was opened for the mass of visitors. - the 2 walk with bottom glas view are not that impressive because you know you are standing on glas, all the floor glasses are full of scratches - in the queue: NO SITTING  Conclusion: Lack of process optimization. Great view but just go there when you have enough time and air in your lungs or enough money in your pocket to buy you a fast lane ticket! Go there early enough to see the city by daylight and take some pictures without reflecting of the night indoor lights. Prepare it to the Eiffel Tower in Paris it isnt that irritating like in Lotte Tower or the Empire State Building in N.Y., there are timeslots there and you can buy the tickets simply online, in english! My opinion!  To the operators: this stay (2019) in Seoul we decided to stay at Park Hyatt Hotel but we had also considered the Signiel Hotel. The best view was the most important factor in this years hotel choice. Next year, i do travel to Korea once a year because of my family, it won’t be the Signiel again. For sure!",17,wait
18,18,320,"We bought our tickets on the app Klook and it was about $50 a person for the amazing combo deal for Lotte World, Lotte Tower and Lotte Aquarium! We noticed that for Lotte World and Lotte Tower alone the tickets for those single attractions were close to $45. We filled an entire day with these Lotte attractions and had so much fun! The Lotte World Tower was a highlight of our trip! We ate at the 123 Lounge on the 123rd floor, it was a little pricey but what you would expect for a high end bar/restaurant with a view like that! Lotte World was almost like a smaller disney with the restaurants, rides, indoor ice rink and gift shops. I can imagine this would be a great place for kids, but even as two adults we had a blast! We went on a Saturday so it was very crowded, I would suggest going on a school day because we saw one of the lines for a ride reached a 2 hour wait with a line that wrapped around the Magic Island zone. Other than that it was a pretty great experience!",18,wait
19,19,344,"We went to find a specific store, Beanpole, and we bought some outfits there. It's very expensive. Customer service is unbeatable. So many people just waiting to help you can be a bit overwhelming sometimes but it was very nice.",19,wait

21,21,365,"This time my kids stuck me in a wheelchair, dicky knees from arthritis. It was a free wheelchair hire. Everything was easily accessible. It was incredibly busy though, The average wait time for a ride was 180 mins!!!! It was a special day though, if you dressed in a school uniform then you got in half price. So, uniforms everywhere. Staff were great though and I went on a few rides. Sometimes even managed to cut a line with my helper. There were still steps to climb though, which the staff were happy to help me with. Beautiful at night due to the lights. A nice way to spend an afternoon evening.",21,wait
22,22,367,"It's huge , super cool. Many VR games/ rides. BUT... for almost all the main rides and popular rides, the waiting long is super long. It takes about 1.5 hours to 2 hours waiting in the queue per ride.... I didn't get to do much... only a couple. I waited for a roller coaster for 2 hours... and realized... all other rides are like that too. And, i arrive at 9:30AM early... still need to wait .",22,wait
23,23,382,"The Lotte World Tower and Mall is a must when in Seoul. The Lotte World Tower is one of the tallest building in the world and offers a day and night breathtaking view with several floors open to the public to visit from the 117th to the 121st floor. Also, you can enjoy and relax by having a dessert and a coffee while you enjoy the view or seat and get an artist to draw you a caricature plus an area to buy some nice souvenirs. You can take pictures to the inside and the outside and wait to see the beautiful sunset in one of the best cities in the world Seoul ! Finally, you can take a walk on the Mall and make sure to go outside and take walk in the park around the lake.",23,wait
24,24,384,We were there for 6 hours. Not even a single attraction can be visited. everywhere queue. wait 2 hours at each ride.. pathetic. Poor safety management. No restriction on crowd allowing,24,wait
25,25,386,"The experience of riding the tower felt sort of like a ride at Disney, there are a lot of distractions to help pass the time while waiting in line. The views at the top are impressive, and the glass floor gives some great photo opportunities. Basically, though, it you have been to a tower at any other city, this is similar. One can easily come away thinking that you might have overpaid for an attraction. You can tell that the S Korean people (full disclosure: I'm Korean), are very proud of this architectural achievement, so that is where I put my mainframe when visiting this place.",25,wait
26,26,420,Look at Seoul in a very special way. 120 floors above the ground give you a stunning view of the whole city. But the price is a rather expensive and there’s quite a bit of waiting time around 30 minutes or so on weekends and holidays.,26,wait
27,27,423,"This is one of the tallest buildings in the world where you can have a panoramic view of Seoul and the famous Han River. On 118/F, it's time to show your courage! The glass floor is there waiting for courageous men to step on it! Looking down through the glass can make you shake and worried if the glass breaks at any second you are staying on it! I was just so amazed how kids fear nothing - they lay on it and they even jumped up and down! ""STOP PLEASE!!!"" I screamed in my heart!  Tip: Check the sunset time and plan your trip. It admits limited people in each time slot so reserve your ticket early. Sunset view on the glass is the definite thing you want to try!",27,wait
28,28,424,"Upon entering this building your taught all about the building with some cool effects and oleds screens the size of the room. Stunning. Then you finally get into a double decker elevator that rockets you to the top, fastest in the world. The effects inside the elevator also cool. Then your brought to the observatory floors and you start to act like a kid. 360 views of the city and also below your feet. Both sides have glass floors, so there really isn't a line to wait to walk on glass. Theres a cafe, wifi, and some cool museum pieces. I got to to look at Napoleans hat and some hand written letters by him.. who would have thought while touring in Korea I would get some french history under my belt. Great for all types of tourists! And theres a theme park in this mega mall too, and a hotel so i suggest booking a few days here.",28,wait
29,29,461,"We traveled over to this side of town strictly to go up the tower and see the city. We went up in the afternoon and there was no wait at all. The elevators were really cool! View at the top was nice and the windows were clean (a pet peeve of mine when taking pictures). There is an area that you can stand over a glass floor, which doesn't have any additional cost. We walked around the mall afterward, which had some cool stores and places to get a snack.",29,wait
30,30,475,"The Lotte Tower Seoul Sky observatory should certainly be listed as one of the highlights of a visit to Seoul. The views, especially of the Han River, at sunset, and just after sunset are breathtaking. You can also see the Olympic Park very well. Admission at 27,000 won is reasonable compared to other World Class towers. There was no wait when we visited on at 6 pm Monday evening. The surrounding area is also of interest, for example Lotte World. There was a haze but it wasn't too bad. Seoul is a fascinating mix of its ancient civilization, the devastation and its unflinching remembrance of its bitter first half of the 20th Century, and the current relentless vitality, affluence and modernity of today. Along with the frenetic shopping districts, the Lotte Tower is an iconic symbol of the latter. Don't miss it !",30,wait
31,31,487,Pricey but is gret to go once to see the skyline and to step on the clear glass and look down. The mall has a good variety too. If you have a mastercard you get a discount 10% At night is best because there is no wait,31,wait
32,32,526,"the review is for only the tower. we stayed at Lotte hotel and best part of it was, we got tix from the hotel. We didn't have to wait in line and went straight up b/c we got the tix from the hotel. That was GREAT !!! It takes a min to get to 110 floor. You can go to the cafe or to the restaurant. Otherwise, it's just looking at the view. I enjoyed it and would say, set aside 30-45min. There's a line to get down but it went fast around late afternoon. They don't let you take a stroller, they keep it downstairs for you.",32,wait
33,33,542,This is the 5th in the world and 4th in Asia. I've seen the others and this compares favourably. The architecture us classical yet beautiful. Connected to an amazing huge futuristic mall.  Located at Jamsil area. The observation deck from floors 117 upward costs about $50 but the queue is extreme.  Plenty of food choices in the mall. But be prepared to wait,33,wait
34,34,544,"Yes, I would rate this as my first choice of favorite super towers, and I've seen a lot of them around the world. Mainly I am impressed with the design and technology along with the great variety of things to do in this tower.  It just opened a few months ago and at 123 floors above ground and 6 floors below ground (parking), it contains practically everything you would ever want. Plan on going VERY EARLY at opening and spend all day. We were there for 2 days. The observation decks are on the top 5 floors (117-123), a hotel from about the 75th to about the 100th floor, residences around the 42nd to 70th floor, and private offices higher up. At 1,800 feet tall, you better not have a fear of heights to visit. Also, this place is very crowded. Furthermore, there is an aquarium, movie theatre, more shops than you can visit in a day, and places to eat although later in the afternoon and evening, it is practically impossible to get anything to eat without waiting a VERY LONG TIME. I this there is approximately 3 million square feet in this mega structure. It can be seen from anywhere in Seoul and one of the top 5 tallest in the world as they claimed. As expected, there is security to get into the building, but not a big deal.  The roughly $50 US dollar cost to express up to the observation decks is much too expensive in our opinion, yet worth it for a one time experience. The transparent floors (some people say glass floors) on the observation deck is incredible. Some people were to scared to stand on them. The elevator to get up there is large, fast, and unique with video displays and high tech. It's the most unusual elevator I've ever seen. Going back done after being up on the observation decks for almost an hour, the staff couldn't manage getting the large number of people in the elevator. Lots of people packed in there with people touching us on all sides. Fortunately it is about only a minute up and down. Ears popping due to the fast speed, yet smooth ride so you don't sense how fast it is moving.  If you come later in the day you will regret being lazy as the lines for mostly anything are long; tickets, elevators, restaurants, etc.  If you are going for the tower and the view, choose a good clear day. One couple told me they were there the prior day and disappointed that they were in the clouds and saw nothing after paying 50,000 Korean Won. I mentioned did they consider standing on the ground and looking up to see if the top of the tower is visible before buying the ticket? If you can't see it when looking up, then you won't see anything when you get up there. No common sense with those folks.  If you are not interested in the tower, you can spend a whole day just shopping or looking around at all the unique sculptures, art, and shops (some affordable and some are high end expensive items).  My rating does not include the fact that in my opinion, this place is not really for elderly people or folks with strollers and wheel chairs as it is much too crowded and no place to sit or rest.  If you go to Seoul and don't visit, then you will miss out on a great experience.",34,wait
35,35,546,"I went with my family in weekday...fantastic because it was not crowded The price is ₩27.000 about US$ 24 The best views in Seoul, we choose a clear day. Ideal to go in the afternoon to wait for the sunset and to take good photos. You can go up to a floor and then you have several floors to see and even 2 outdoor terraces Its a cafeteria and a nice shop where we bought a magnet!! Then when you go down I recommend to eat at the Mall, you have several options and for example ""On tge Border"", ""Pizza and Pasta"" or ""Hard Rock""",35,wait
36,36,547,I visited the Lotte Tower in early September and had a great view of the city on a beautifully clear day. The multiple observation decks and glass floors in certain areas make for an unforgettable experience. I got there shortly after the tower opened for the morning (10:00 AM) on a weekday and was able to purchase my tickets and go right up to the observation deck without any waiting.,36,wait
37,37,551,I loved this mall! We spent an entire day there. There were two different sections. One had more high-end shops like Chanel while the other part had more affordable stores like Uniqlo. There were also lots of great food options. The only downside is that there are long lines for all of the restaurants. We had to wait 45 minute to be seated for dinner.,37,wait
38,38,576,"Went there on a sunny Sunday afternoon. There were quite a lot of people in line at the ticket counters as expected, but since they were very efficient, we just waited for about 10 minutes until we got our tickets. Waiting time for the elevator was then another 15 minutes, which was faster then assumed too.  Adult ticket is 27.000 WON (~25 EUR/26 USD). Kids are about half price. There is also an Express-Ticket for 50.000 WON to pass the lines at the elevator etc.  Going up by the high speed elevator is nice and just takes a minute.  The multi-floor observation deck has a coffee lounge, photo stand, souvenir shop and two glass bottom areas. Also there are two outside terraces.  Plan to spend about 45 minutes there on the top of the tower, which is enough for sure to see everything.  The modern, elegant and big Lotte Mall itself is surely also nice to walk through, however we just went for the Tower.",38,wait

The elevator to the top rises 118 floors in one minute. The views are great! I would shoot for off-season and I like the views best at night. This is one of those places that easily gets jammed with tourists at the wrong time. The observation deck has a glass floor and just a net over the top to catch things falling from above. (What can fall from above at this height?) It would also be tremendous to see a fireworks display from up here. New Years Eve must be wild!,46,almost

50,8,434,"Located in the southern region of Seoul below the Han river, Lotte World Tower is one of the city's must-see attractions. At almost a half a kilometre tall (over 1,600 feet), on a sunny day it can cast a shadow in the sky and provides stunning 360 degree views of the vast metropolis. Taking only around sixty seconds to reach the multi-level viewing deck, you can step onto caged outside balconies, stand on a glass floor looking down onto busy traffic, take photos with ubiquitous kawaii mascots and marvel at the flawless overall undertaking and accompanying production (LED screens, computer graphics). Unlike other sky-high decks visited, the attraction doesn't have add-on charges for other experiences once you're up there - a welcome change to the usual tourist up-sell. Visited on a weekday, the number of visitors was relatively low and allowed ample opportunities to take the perfect photo. Entry is via the basement, which is part of the larger Lotte World mall.  The mall itself offers plenty of local and international fashion brands in addition to a vast variety of retail, loads of food and beverage options and can be travelled to and from via the complex's underground railway station.

Overall it was a bit of a letdown but interesting to see. Not a great selection for Men.",64,would
65,11,284,"for not being the tallest in the world & still having infrastructural issues during its construction; not even guaranteeing the view that would compensate for most of the price, i'd say this thing is overrated; even when you get to the top, some of the things are extra.. . ""buyer-beware""..",65,would
66,12,300,"1. the mall is like any big mall in Korea, nothing special I think  2. my review is about the tower: positive: - outstanding View from the 117th to 121th floor, about 500m -> for that 1 point  negative: - expensive, adult 26000 Won per person - it took more than 70 min to get upstairs, all the procedures like security scan, taking photos to sell them later, just endless waiting in several rooms without a window, the air condition was turned on in stand by modus, there was just simply not enough refreshing cool air coming out of the aircon, nobody of the staff cared, you just were pushed through all the rooms like a herd of sheep There were no information about the waiting time. If i had knew that then i would have paid the fast check in ticket which costs 50000 Won.This is outrageous expensive but in retrospect worth it. Of course first of all you must afford this price. Everyone who is able to do it should do it because when you stand in the queue for about 50 min and you see the fast tracker who paid more because they „knew“ and they are passing through the middle line to the elevator then the damn legs are hurting even more and you are still not in the elevator. Because they skip the queue, the waiting people have to wait longer, maybe your spot in the elevator was taken by one of the high payers. - show room was closed - the outside terrace was closed - the service and the staff processes have to optimize a lot I think - started at the end of the queue at 16.30, to see the Sunset. We arrived round about 17.45 in the 118th floor. Then it was dark night. The windows are reflecting the inside light so the pictures you make are always with co-displayed with people around you - downstairs same procedure: another QUEUE, the second one. A little bit faster downstairs, round about 45min, but still too much time lost. The sightviewing floors are big enough, there was no hustle, so the main problem was the ONE and ONLY elevator (of obviously 2) which was opened for the mass of visitors. - the 2 walk with bottom glas view are not that impressive because you know you are standing on glas, all the floor glasses are full of scratches - in the queue: NO SITTING  Conclusion: Lack of process optimization. Great view but just go there when you have enough time and air in your lungs or enough money in your pocket to buy you a fast lane ticket! Go there early enough to see the city by daylight and take some pictures without reflecting of the night indoor lights. Prepare it to the Eiffel Tower in Paris it isnt that irritating like in Lotte Tower or the Empire State Building in N.Y., there are timeslots there and you can buy the tickets simply online, in english! My opinion!  To the operators: this stay (2019) in Seoul we decided to stay at Park Hyatt Hotel but we had also considered the Signiel Hotel. The best view was the most important factor in this years hotel choice. Next year, i do travel to Korea once a year because of my family, it won’t be the Signiel again. For sure!",66,would
67,13,307,"The entrance ticket was a bit expensive but overall the experience of the visit was really pleasant. We went during the nighttime which was nice to see the overview of Seoul with the street lights, but I think for a better experience it would be best to go during the daytime.",67,would

We noticed that for Lotte World and Lotte Tower alone the tickets for those single attractions were close to $45. We filled an entire day with these Lotte attractions and had so much fun! The Lotte World Tower was a highlight of our trip! We ate at the 123 Lounge on the 123rd floor, it was a little pricey but what you would expect for a high end bar/restaurant with a view like that! Lotte World was almost like a smaller disney with the restaurants, rides, indoor ice rink and gift shops. I can imagine this would be a great place for kids, but even as two adults we had a blast! We went on a Saturday so it was very crowded, I would suggest going on a school day because we saw one of the lines for a ride reached a 2 hour wait with a line that wrapped around the Magic Island zone. Other than that it was a pretty great experience!",68,would
69,15,322,"While on a mixed business / family trip to Seoul earlier this year, we went to the Lotte World Tower because it seemed to be the area in Seoul with the earliest cherry blossoms. Sorry, this review is obviously a little late because this annual event obviously takes place in April but better late than never. So if you happen to be in Seoul and the cherry blossom season is just starting (usually early April) this would be the place to go to, in particular the 2 small lakes just to the South of the Lotte WT&M. It's lovely and full with people taking pictures and I would imagine it will be quite nice during the rest of year also. The shopping mall itself is amazingly large, there's everything but like with lots of these big malls, it's full of branded shops which tend to be more expensive. So this is probably not the place to come for local, cheap goodies. But worthwhile if you like shopping. There are plenty of restaurants and a lot of them look very tempting. Lots of different foods but the one that caught our eye was a very small local Korean restaurant which seemed to be only frequented by staff working in the World Tower and Mall. It was very cheap with very tasty food, the surroundings matched the price, very simple and very few decorations but if you want to fill up your stomach without spending an awful lot of time in a restaurant, then go to MyeongDong Halmoni Kalguksu (명동할머니국수), which you can find in the Seoul Seoul 3080 restaurant area on the 6F. I tried to find this restaurant for review separately but it's not yet listed on TripAdvisor, hence I'll mention it here. I'd go definitely go there again for the quality of the food at rock bottom prices. The Tower itself is massively tall and quite pretty. We didn't go to the top, mainly because we had no time and it's also quite expensive, compared to going up Seoul Tower in the city centre (separate review). Certainly an area of Seoul which you should put on your list when visiting.",69,would
70,16,345,The Lotte Tower is the 8th tallest building in the world at 486m and 125 stories. (For comparison the Burj Khalifa is 228 stories--almost twice as tall!) The elevator to the top rises 118 floors in one minute. The views are great! I would shoot for off-season and I like the views best at night. This is one of those places that easily gets jammed with tourists at the wrong time. The observation deck has a glass floor and just a net over the top to catch things falling from above. (What can fall from above at this height?) It would also be tremendous to see a fireworks display from up here. New Years Eve must be wild!,70,would
71,17,366,"We visited the Lotte World Tower in February, only visiting the Mall as a means of accessing the Tower.  Quite a pricey visit, although we were pleasantly surprised to receive a discount for using a Mastercard to pay for our tickets, which then worked out at 48000 KrWon for two of us. There are a number of corridors to walk through, with images screened on the walls, before you arrive at the elevator - a double decker and very fast. You also have the opportunity to have a photo taken with a chosen image on a green screen behind you, a similar opportunity is in place at the top of the tower, but there is no pressure to take part.  It was all relatively quiet at this time of year but the length of corridors and screens indicate that they are there to keep visitors engaged during the busy season and that queues could get extremely long.  The lift ride up to the 117th floor was rapid, ears popping en route, and more images being screened on the walls of the lift as we travelled.  The public floors at the top of the tower are more compact than one would imagine, well organised with plenty of seating around the central section. We felt it was far less commercialised than Taipei 101, with plenty of staff available but a pretty much hands off approach.  There is a glass floor section for the brave, where you can look out or down over 100 floors. Not for the faint-hearted but a good photo opportunity. There are also two 'observation decks', which have a double door arrangement to maintain temperature within the tower. A member of staff regulates entry and exit to these decks. It was dark by the time we accessed these, the buildings were all lit up and car lights blended in along the roads out of the city and it was spectacular.  Views are wonderful. I don't think Seoul is a particularly attractive city, but this was a good way to see it and the height added something. The skies had been clear blue when we entered the Mall but, unfortunately, by the time we emerged at the top, everything was rather misty and cloudy, hence our best photos came after the sun set. Any visit is at the mercy of the weather and, particularly in February, you do take a calculated risk if you are hoping for good photos.  There are a number of retail outlets at the top of the tower with, as one would expect, Tower themed souvenirs, ranging from postcards to much more ambitious items. Prices not as hyped up as one might imagine. Bizarrely a 'pick n mix' sweet counter and a cafe, an ice cream counter and a bar lounge.  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would recommend it.",71,would
72,18,369,"I had already been up the Namsan Seoul Tower when I went here, so thought it would be about the same. But in my opinion the view from the lotte world tower is even better. And the fact that you can stand on the glass floor on the 118th floor and look down just adds to the experience. There was also a terrance at another floor, which was unfortunatly closed when we were there.  The mall is great, with lots of stores. But there are alot of malls like that. The tower is what is truly special.",72,would
73,19,374,"Our American family of five, kids ages 10, 13 and 16, visited the Lotte Tower with a native South Korean. It was very nice to have our friend there, but his interpretation skills were really not necessary. We were not there to go shopping, but rather to have the Sky Tower experience. The cue area was empty for our morning visit, but if you had to stand in line, there are interesting things to look at while you wind yourself through the maze. The elevator is filled with tv screens and the ride up is amazing and beautiful. It stops near the very top and then visitors can take their time in visiting each of the floors, until they reach the very top, the 123rd floor, which consists of an expensive restaurant/lounge. Be sure to go on a relatively clear day, because you will be able to see for kilometers. Regardless of the weather, throughout much of the year the ""very fine dust that blows over from Eastern China"" obscures the view. We all liked the clear floor, so we could see straight down to the ground below. As an American from the suburbs it is impressive to see the hundreds and hundreds of apartment buildings that house the majority of South Korea's population. This was a very different experience from the Seoul Tower, which honestly I preferred. However, had we visited the Lotte Tower before the Seoul Tower, we would have been unimpressed because it has fewer stories, so the view wasn't quite as impressive.",73,would

I was under a bit of time pressure so I didn't fully explore the full extent of the shops in the mall. But there certainly seemed to be a plethora of high end branded shops and stores as well as more than enough places to eat and drink. No doubt a compulsive shopper would have a field day here. There was even a duty free shop but I didn't go in this time.,77,would

Then your brought to the observatory floors and you start to act like a kid. 360 views of the city and also below your feet. Both sides have glass floors, so there really isn't a line to wait to walk on glass. Theres a cafe, wifi, and some cool museum pieces. I got to to look at Napoleans hat and some hand written letters by him.. who would have thought while touring in Korea I would get some french history under my belt. Great for all types of tourists!

Since the building is on the east side of the city, if you go in the morning the sun will be behind you and you'll have a nice view to the rest of the city of the west. It turned out to be a really good view. I would also assume sunset is the other best time to go.  Most of the floors are the same and it's your standard ""going up a tall building"" experience with a fancy elevator ride and an expensive gift shop up on the top. Seoul isn't really gorgeous from this eastern part of the city and the view consists mostly of endless rows of apartment blocks, Lotte World, hills, and the admittedly impressive Han River. There is no Hong Kong-or-NYC-style standout skyline feature of Seoul to see from here because you're standing in it.",82,would

From the second we entered the Lotte World Tower, a sensation came over me as I looked up at the endless high ceiling. Before I go any further let me state, for you to truly experience this magnificent hotel you should have the option to experience the elements of surprise. Therefore, I will present only basic facts enough to peak your interest without giving away all the unique features you will experience. If you were to google a map of Seoul the most obvious feature you will notice is a building towering above all other structures. The Lotte World Tower is the tallest building in South Korea, reaching 123 floors at a height of 1,819 feet. It is the fifth tallest building in the world. Just for the record, our room number was 9882! That is correct the 98th Floor! The view was breathtaking and certainly the highest floor we have had the pleasure of staying for the night. The hotel is connected to the Lotte World Mall. The Mall is exceptionally large, modern and beautiful offering a host of famous brand names with numerous places to eat with a variety of delicacies from around the world. In the basement of the hotel is an outstanding Aquarium truly worth visiting. Their specious lounge, is a place we frequently visited to relax and enjoy the panoramic view of the city located on the 79th floor. There is an outstanding observation deck located on the 123-floor overlooking the city. From our room we could see the river that was incredible especially when watching the city lights at night. The hotel of course offers all the amenities found only in the top luxury hotels. Wait until you see your uniquely designed room especially the bathroom! I highly recommend you take advantage of their outstanding breakfast. Everything is fresh and with a variety of choices that are professionally served. My suggestion is order their smoothie, the combinations of taste is exceptionally delicious. Of all the highlights offered by any hotel it always comes down to the quality of service by the staff. Having travelled around the world the personnel at the Signiel hotel we would rate above outstanding. Their kindness and efficiency is second to none and they make you feel right at home. We consider the whole complex a “City within a city”. Seoul has hundreds of top end hotels to choose from but, if you want to truly experience something from a fancy world, the choice is obvious. It certainly captured our hearts the moment the doors were open. On a personal note, when visiting a new hotel, I always make a concretive effort to try and find flaws. Paying particularly attention to the smallest details to challenge their efforts to put their best foot forward. I can honestly say without hesitation; this hotel is truly a Perfect 10!",84,would

It is pretty standard as far as malls go, with a large variety of stores and restaurants, but also it has some unique places and features. If you want to shop, I would recommend here. It is a pretty standard mall, but the sheer size is the most amazing part. Also, if you are interested you can also visit the top of the tower. Being the tallest tower in the OECD means that it has some amazing views. Not only that, but Seoul is also one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the world sitting at around 25million people.

I would definitely come back to go to the top when I have more time !",92,would
93,39,544,"Yes, I would rate this as my first choice of favorite super towers, and I've seen a lot of them around the world. Mainly I am impressed with the design and technology along with the great variety of things to do in this tower.  It just opened a few months ago and at 123 floors above ground and 6 floors below ground (parking), it contains practically everything you would ever want. Plan on going VERY EARLY at opening and spend all day. We were there for 2 days. The observation decks are on the top 5 floors (117-123), a hotel from about the 75th to about the 100th floor, residences around the 42nd to 70th floor, and private offices higher up. At 1,800 feet tall, you better not have a fear of heights to visit. Also, this place is very crowded. Furthermore, there is an aquarium, movie theatre, more shops than you can visit in a day, and places to eat although later in the afternoon and evening, it is practically impossible to get anything to eat without waiting a VERY LONG TIME. I this there is approximately 3 million square feet in this mega structure. It can be seen from anywhere in Seoul and one of the top 5 tallest in the world as they claimed. As expected, there is security to get into the building, but not a big deal.  The roughly $50 US dollar cost to express up to the observation decks is much too expensive in our opinion, yet worth it for a one time experience. The transparent floors (some people say glass floors) on the observation deck is incredible. Some people were to scared to stand on them. The elevator to get up there is large, fast, and unique with video displays and high tech. It's the most unusual elevator I've ever seen. Going back done after being up on the observation decks for almost an hour, the staff couldn't manage getting the large number of people in the elevator. Lots of people packed in there with people touching us on all sides. Fortunately it is about only a minute up and down. Ears popping due to the fast speed, yet smooth ride so you don't sense how fast it is moving.  If you come later in the day you will regret being lazy as the lines for mostly anything are long; tickets, elevators, restaurants, etc.  If you are going for the tower and the view, choose a good clear day. One couple told me they were there the prior day and disappointed that they were in the clouds and saw nothing after paying 50,000 Korean Won. I mentioned did they consider standing on the ground and looking up to see if the top of the tower is visible before buying the ticket? If you can't see it when looking up, then you won't see anything when you get up there. No common sense with those folks.  If you are not interested in the tower, you can spend a whole day just shopping or looking around at all the unique sculptures, art, and shops (some affordable and some are high end expensive items).  My rating does not include the fact that in my opinion, this place is not really for elderly people or folks with strollers and wheel chairs as it is much too crowded and no place to sit or rest.  If you go to Seoul and don't visit, then you will miss out on a great experience.",93,would

It would have been a much more enjoyable ride if they had 2 or 3 less people on the elevator. You literally have people pressing up against you on every side. Once we got to the observation deck I was disappointed to look out the glass and discover we were in the clouds, you couldn't see anything. It would have been nice if they had warned you before you bought your tickets that you wouldn't be able to see much. There were a couple small breaks in the clouds and you could see a little bit of the ground, but then all the rain running down the windows made good pictures nearly impossible. When it was time to line back up for the elevator to go back down, there seemed to be no order to the line, people were cutting the line, pushing & shoving.

However the observation tower fees is just ridiculously expensive for the 5th tallest building in the world. I would save the money to visit the Burj.

The top draw in the observation deck is undisputedly the glass bottom which truly tests your fear for heights and is not for the faint-hearted. The 360 degrees view from the top is spectacular but only if the weather is permitting.

As at point of ordering photos, we could not see clearly from the computer screen if it was good either.  Explained from the fridge magnet which I had bought. - Lotte world Tower's main motif is Korean traditional porcelain and brush. The tower's appearance expresses ""the beauty of curve"" architecturally, with the design of becoming narrow as it goes high. Also the state of the art technique called ""diagrid structure"" is applied. Diagrid is a compound word of ""diagonal"" and ""grid"", the structure enhances the ability to endure typhoon and earthquake.

Just behind the world tower you can find Seokchon lake which has a walking track and you can appreciate the area from many angles. Had I known about this place I would have grabbed some food and a drink as there are many areas to sit. Lotte World Tower Hotel is in its final stages of construction and will eventually be linked to this Mall as well. The Lotte World Tower Mall is easily accessible by metro; it is right on top of the Jamsil Station which is a subway interchange between the green and pink lines. The pink line's Jamsil subway exits are linked to the basements of Lotte World Tower Mall itself which has a duplex hypermarket Lotte Mart and a duplex aquarium. The Lotte World Tower Mall main wing also hosts a department store, countless standalone shops and restaurants, a big cineplex (on its upper floors) and Hard Rock Cafe Seoul. The green subway line at Jamsil, and the Lotte World Theme Park across the road are connected to the high end wing Lotte Avenuel Mall. There is a several restaurants on the uppermost floors of Lotte Avenuel Mall that have an excellent view of Seokchon Lake and its surrounding park. An avid shopper will probably find it inadequate to spend an entire day exploring this sprawling 2-in-1 mega mall. The main wing of the Lotte World Mall has all the popular chain stores like H&M, Uniqlo, Zara, etc as well as branches of Korean cosmetic shops such as Etude House, Face Shop, Innisfree, Laneige, etc. I reckon the Lotte World Tower Mall will be a good place to escape from the scorching summer heat or freezing winter weather.",103,would

117,12,300,"1. the mall is like any big mall in Korea, nothing special I think  2. my review is about the tower: positive: - outstanding View from the 117th to 121th floor, about 500m -> for that 1 point  negative: - expensive, adult 26000 Won per person - it took more than 70 min to get upstairs, all the procedures like security scan, taking photos to sell them later, just endless waiting in several rooms without a window, the air condition was turned on in stand by modus, there was just simply not enough refreshing cool air coming out of the aircon, nobody of the staff cared, you just were pushed through all the rooms like a herd of sheep There were no information about the waiting time. If i had knew that then i would have paid the fast check in ticket which costs 50000 Won.This is outrageous expensive but in retrospect worth it. Of course first of all you must afford this price. Everyone who is able to do it should do it because when you stand in the queue for about 50 min and you see the fast tracker who paid more because they „knew“ and they are passing through the middle line to the elevator then the damn legs are hurting even more and you are still not in the elevator. Because they skip the queue, the waiting people have to wait longer, maybe your spot in the elevator was taken by one of the high payers. - show room was closed - the outside terrace was closed - the service and the staff processes have to optimize a lot I think - started at the end of the queue at 16.30, to see the Sunset. We arrived round about 17.45 in the 118th floor. Then it was dark night. The windows are reflecting the inside light so the pictures you make are always with co-displayed with people around you - downstairs same procedure: another QUEUE, the second one. A little bit faster downstairs, round about 45min, but still too much time lost. The sightviewing floors are big enough, there was no hustle, so the main problem was the ONE and ONLY elevator (of obviously 2) which was opened for the mass of visitors. - the 2 walk with bottom glas view are not that impressive because you know you are standing on glas, all the floor glasses are full of scratches - in the queue: NO SITTING  Conclusion: Lack of process optimization. Great view but just go there when you have enough time and air in your lungs or enough money in your pocket to buy you a fast lane ticket! Go there early enough to see the city by daylight and take some pictures without reflecting of the night indoor lights. Prepare it to the Eiffel Tower in Paris it isnt that irritating like in Lotte Tower or the Empire State Building in N.Y., there are timeslots there and you can buy the tickets simply online, in english! My opinion!  To the operators: this stay (2019) in Seoul we decided to stay at Park Hyatt Hotel but we had also considered the Signiel Hotel. The best view was the most important factor in this years hotel choice. Next year, i do travel to Korea once a year because of my family, it won’t be the Signiel again. For sure!",117,long

119,14,366,"We visited the Lotte World Tower in February, only visiting the Mall as a means of accessing the Tower.  Quite a pricey visit, although we were pleasantly surprised to receive a discount for using a Mastercard to pay for our tickets, which then worked out at 48000 KrWon for two of us. There are a number of corridors to walk through, with images screened on the walls, before you arrive at the elevator - a double decker and very fast. You also have the opportunity to have a photo taken with a chosen image on a green screen behind you, a similar opportunity is in place at the top of the tower, but there is no pressure to take part.  It was all relatively quiet at this time of year but the length of corridors and screens indicate that they are there to keep visitors engaged during the busy season and that queues could get extremely long.  The lift ride up to the 117th floor was rapid, ears popping en route, and more images being screened on the walls of the lift as we travelled.  The public floors at the top of the tower are more compact than one would imagine, well organised with plenty of seating around the central section. We felt it was far less commercialised than Taipei 101, with plenty of staff available but a pretty much hands off approach.  There is a glass floor section for the brave, where you can look out or down over 100 floors. Not for the faint-hearted but a good photo opportunity. There are also two 'observation decks', which have a double door arrangement to maintain temperature within the tower. A member of staff regulates entry and exit to these decks. It was dark by the time we accessed these, the buildings were all lit up and car lights blended in along the roads out of the city and it was spectacular.  Views are wonderful. I don't think Seoul is a particularly attractive city, but this was a good way to see it and the height added something. The skies had been clear blue when we entered the Mall but, unfortunately, by the time we emerged at the top, everything was rather misty and cloudy, hence our best photos came after the sun set. Any visit is at the mercy of the weather and, particularly in February, you do take a calculated risk if you are hoping for good photos.  There are a number of retail outlets at the top of the tower with, as one would expect, Tower themed souvenirs, ranging from postcards to much more ambitious items. Prices not as hyped up as one might imagine. Bizarrely a 'pick n mix' sweet counter and a cafe, an ice cream counter and a bar lounge.  We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and would recommend it.",119,long

There are multiple floors when you get up: one with a glass floor and another with an outdoor area, so there is lots to see and from different viewpoints. It was extremely well organized and staff very professional and polite. The view was incredible, you can see for very far over the city and the river. Just make sure to go on a clear day.

The lake is sort of divided into two sections, separated by a bridge, but one could walk around the whole lake along the walkway.

128,23,469,"This is one of the tallest towers in the world, so we decided to pay the exorbitant entrance fee to see it for ourselves. You can pay by cash or by credit. After you pay your entrance fee you are taken to the lifts which take you to the observation platforms. The lift in itself is a bit of an experience – there are screens on all the walls and the ceiling which display a short show about the tower while you are riding up.  The towers are impressively tall, and from that distance you lose perspective of how high up you actually are. There are several observation deck levels, and each deck has something different on offer. There is a level that has a couple of glass floor areas where you can look down to the street below (that's a bit freaky at first!), there's a level where you can go to a balcony area, there is a cafe and when we were there there were displays commemorating the winter Olympics and some statues of the Olympic mascots that you could have photos with.

Admission at 27,000 won is reasonable compared to other World Class towers. There was no wait when we visited on at 6 pm Monday evening. The surrounding area is also of interest, for example Lotte World. There was a haze but it wasn't too bad. Seoul is a fascinating mix of its ancient civilization, the devastation and its unflinching remembrance of its bitter first half of the 20th Century, and the current relentless vitality, affluence and modernity of today. Along with the frenetic shopping districts, the Lotte Tower is an iconic symbol of the latter. Don't miss it !",129,long

As long as I wasn't anywhere near the Plexiglas, I was fine. They have a souvenir shop and some restaurants in the tower. It costs 27000 won to enter but you can stay as long as you like.

133,28,544,"Yes, I would rate this as my first choice of favorite super towers, and I've seen a lot of them around the world. Mainly I am impressed with the design and technology along with the great variety of things to do in this tower.  It just opened a few months ago and at 123 floors above ground and 6 floors below ground (parking), it contains practically everything you would ever want. Plan on going VERY EARLY at opening and spend all day. We were there for 2 days. The observation decks are on the top 5 floors (117-123), a hotel from about the 75th to about the 100th floor, residences around the 42nd to 70th floor, and private offices higher up. At 1,800 feet tall, you better not have a fear of heights to visit. Also, this place is very crowded. Furthermore, there is an aquarium, movie theatre, more shops than you can visit in a day, and places to eat although later in the afternoon and evening, it is practically impossible to get anything to eat without waiting a VERY LONG TIME. I this there is approximately 3 million square feet in this mega structure. It can be seen from anywhere in Seoul and one of the top 5 tallest in the world as they claimed. As expected, there is security to get into the building, but not a big deal.  The roughly $50 US dollar cost to express up to the observation decks is much too expensive in our opinion, yet worth it for a one time experience. The transparent floors (some people say glass floors) on the observation deck is incredible. Some people were to scared to stand on them. The elevator to get up there is large, fast, and unique with video displays and high tech. It's the most unusual elevator I've ever seen. Going back done after being up on the observation decks for almost an hour, the staff couldn't manage getting the large number of people in the elevator. Lots of people packed in there with people touching us on all sides. Fortunately it is about only a minute up and down. Ears popping due to the fast speed, yet smooth ride so you don't sense how fast it is moving.  If you come later in the day you will regret being lazy as the lines for mostly anything are long; tickets, elevators, restaurants, etc.  If you are going for the tower and the view, choose a good clear day. One couple told me they were there the prior day and disappointed that they were in the clouds and saw nothing after paying 50,000 Korean Won. I mentioned did they consider standing on the ground and looking up to see if the top of the tower is visible before buying the ticket? If you can't see it when looking up, then you won't see anything when you get up there. No common sense with those folks.  If you are not interested in the tower, you can spend a whole day just shopping or looking around at all the unique sculptures, art, and shops (some affordable and some are high end expensive items).  My rating does not include the fact that in my opinion, this place is not really for elderly people or folks with strollers and wheel chairs as it is much too crowded and no place to sit or rest.  If you go to Seoul and don't visit, then you will miss out on a great experience.",133,long

It stops near the very top and then visitors can take their time in visiting each of the floors, until they reach the very top, the 123rd floor, which consists of an expensive restaurant/lounge. Be sure to go on a relatively clear day, because you will be able to see for kilometers. Regardless of the weather, throughout much of the year the ""very fine dust that blows over from Eastern China"" obscures the view. We all liked the clear floor, so we could see straight down to the ground below. As an American from the suburbs it is impressive to see the hundreds and hundreds of apartment buildings that house the majority of South Korea's population. This was a very different experience from the Seoul Tower, which honestly I preferred. However, had we visited the Lotte Tower before the Seoul Tower, we would have been unimpressed because it has fewer stories, so the view wasn't quite as impressive.",154,much
155,19,410,Mall was a disappointment. Especially Avenue and duty free. Aquarium was average. Not much to see inside.,155,much
156,20,418,Spent a few hours there with the kids. They thoroughly enjoy it except for kids under 4 years old. I think this suit kids above 5 yrs old or older. Nothing much for elderly or parents looking after toddlers. I would think you can spent a whole day there. A plus point is there are shopping and you can walk to the aquarium on the other end.,156,much
157,21,421,"The Lotte World Tower and Mall is worth a detour. Not because of the mall, very nice but also very much like any high end mall. No; go up the tower. It's not cheap, but definately an experience. They e.g. have a glass floor were you have a somewhat unnerving view straigth down. But also a truly spectacular view over Seoul.",157,much
158,22,437,"Lotte World Tower or ""Seoul Sky"" is much like other observation deck experiences. As you buy your tickets you can check what the weather and visibility is like. Prices were reasonable. Got a 9000kw discount as it was my birthday month (need to prove with passport). There is security screens, a bit of queuing and photos to be taken before you get to the elevator. But having been to other Observation Towers, this is not unusual. The fancy super video screens were though. The price of the photos was very good!! Up the top there's a few levels. One allows you to go outside, and another has the glass floor to test your brain (I struggle to step out into the glass floor). One level had a video to show what old Korea looked like compared to now which was interesting. We checked out the top most observation deck, where you had to purchase food or drink to attend, but it was 27000kw for a chicken sandwich so we passed. It was the first time we had seen really inflated prices so we were shocked. But overall it was a good experience. Only a must see if you like seeing the sprawling city. Back on the ground floor in the mall was s really nice restaurant that had Italian food - pizza, pasta and a lamb salad that was to die for!! But I know, you don't go to Korea for Italian food but when you're with a bunch of ex-pats they are hanging for a taste of what they miss from home!! and pizza and salad are hard to find!!",158,much
159,23,471,"Go there. This is the best Mall ever. I do not think we have one as nice in the United States. There is food, Designer Shops, Shoes, everything a person would want in the mall. There is an Aquarium and an Art Museum. I enjoyed it so much I went back a second time. The train station has underground shopping also and you can access the mall from the train station.",159,much
160,24,478,The mall is located in a upscale area so with that comes upscale prices. Modern designed and clean mall with many artistic displays. Luxury designer brands line the first 2 to 3 floors.Dining options are located on the basement level with some play areas and shops for kids. This place is a shoppers paradise but if shopping is not really your thing it can been browsed quickly or even skipped without feeling like you missed much.,160,much

163,27,502,"Frankly, i don't really think it is that wonderful. Observatory deck - Been to a few other observatory decks in Japan and Dubai, Lotte World observatory deck is on the average side. The only memorable thing i remember is the glass panel on the floor. Lotte World Mall - the first 4 levels are all the branded stuff and only B1 house more affordable brands. Nothing much. Although i must say, they have tons of eatery places here so surely you can find something that suits your taste.",163,much
164,28,507,I liked this new tower very much. It is fifth tallest in the world. There are several levels for viewing and with snack shops with a restaurant on the very top level. It is over the Lotte mall which is fabulous. Nice souvenir items inclduing photos. Did not experience a long line in the winter. No outdoor viewing permitted in January.,164,much
165,29,544,"Yes, I would rate this as my first choice of favorite super towers, and I've seen a lot of them around the world. Mainly I am impressed with the design and technology along with the great variety of things to do in this tower.  It just opened a few months ago and at 123 floors above ground and 6 floors below ground (parking), it contains practically everything you would ever want. Plan on going VERY EARLY at opening and spend all day. We were there for 2 days. The observation decks are on the top 5 floors (117-123), a hotel from about the 75th to about the 100th floor, residences around the 42nd to 70th floor, and private offices higher up. At 1,800 feet tall, you better not have a fear of heights to visit. Also, this place is very crowded. Furthermore, there is an aquarium, movie theatre, more shops than you can visit in a day, and places to eat although later in the afternoon and evening, it is practically impossible to get anything to eat without waiting a VERY LONG TIME. I this there is approximately 3 million square feet in this mega structure. It can be seen from anywhere in Seoul and one of the top 5 tallest in the world as they claimed. As expected, there is security to get into the building, but not a big deal.  The roughly $50 US dollar cost to express up to the observation decks is much too expensive in our opinion, yet worth it for a one time experience. The transparent floors (some people say glass floors) on the observation deck is incredible. Some people were to scared to stand on them. The elevator to get up there is large, fast, and unique with video displays and high tech. It's the most unusual elevator I've ever seen. Going back done after being up on the observation decks for almost an hour, the staff couldn't manage getting the large number of people in the elevator. Lots of people packed in there with people touching us on all sides. Fortunately it is about only a minute up and down. Ears popping due to the fast speed, yet smooth ride so you don't sense how fast it is moving.  If you come later in the day you will regret being lazy as the lines for mostly anything are long; tickets, elevators, restaurants, etc.  If you are going for the tower and the view, choose a good clear day. One couple told me they were there the prior day and disappointed that they were in the clouds and saw nothing after paying 50,000 Korean Won. I mentioned did they consider standing on the ground and looking up to see if the top of the tower is visible before buying the ticket? If you can't see it when looking up, then you won't see anything when you get up there. No common sense with those folks.  If you are not interested in the tower, you can spend a whole day just shopping or looking around at all the unique sculptures, art, and shops (some affordable and some are high end expensive items).  My rating does not include the fact that in my opinion, this place is not really for elderly people or folks with strollers and wheel chairs as it is much too crowded and no place to sit or rest.  If you go to Seoul and don't visit, then you will miss out on a great experience.",165,much
166,30,552,"I took the Sky Shuttle to the top of the tower. It was not a very busy day for it, but they still packed you into the elevator like sardines. It would have been a much more enjoyable ride if they had 2 or 3 less people on the elevator. You literally have people pressing up against you on every side. Once we got to the observation deck I was disappointed to look out the glass and discover we were in the clouds, you couldn't see anything. It would have been nice if they had warned you before you bought your tickets that you wouldn't be able to see much. There were a couple small breaks in the clouds and you could see a little bit of the ground, but then all the rain running down the windows made good pictures nearly impossible. When it was time to line back up for the elevator to go back down, there seemed to be no order to the line, people were cutting the line, pushing & shoving. It would be a great experience on a nice day if the staff did a better job of managing the crowd.",166,much
167,31,578,"This is one of the cleanest, largest, most varied shopping malls I have ever been to. Though I am not much of a shopper, I can appreciate the large variety of shops, entertainment and restaurants available here. The 5+ story mall is organized by type of shop, which is convenient. For example, there is a children's section with 15+ shops, luxury goods take up an entire floor, etc. There are also many electronic directory kiosks available on each floor to help you find things. The bottom floor has an excellent aquarium that would appeal to visitors of all ages. There are also many options for dining, both casual and fine restaurants. This is a great place to spend a rainy day exploring, shopping and eating. It is easily accessible through the Jamsil subway station.",167,much

Even you buy the ticket in advance there are long waiting cues (over 1,5 hours). Then on top there are just some small cafes (nothing special) and souvenir shops. The view is nice but really not outstanding. Only good thing there is the short elevator drive and enjoying a cocktail on top.",171,nothing
172,4,278,"I wasn't overly impressed with this building. I went to a function there. There was nothing special about anything here. The view is nice. I wouldn't avoid it, but don't go out of your way to visit.",172,nothing
173,5,292,"Took the world’s first 60secs to level 118! The feeling was well, nothing much. Just abit if ears stuck. The technology in the lift is also awesome. Super high up the tower, could see the overall of Seoul. It’s beautiful",173,nothing
174,6,300,"1. the mall is like any big mall in Korea, nothing special I think  2. my review is about the tower: positive: - outstanding View from the 117th to 121th floor, about 500m -> for that 1 point  negative: - expensive, adult 26000 Won per person - it took more than 70 min to get upstairs, all the procedures like security scan, taking photos to sell them later, just endless waiting in several rooms without a window, the air condition was turned on in stand by modus, there was just simply not enough refreshing cool air coming out of the aircon, nobody of the staff cared, you just were pushed through all the rooms like a herd of sheep There were no information about the waiting time. If i had knew that then i would have paid the fast check in ticket which costs 50000 Won.This is outrageous expensive but in retrospect worth it. Of course first of all you must afford this price. Everyone who is able to do it should do it because when you stand in the queue for about 50 min and you see the fast tracker who paid more because they „knew“ and they are passing through the middle line to the elevator then the damn legs are hurting even more and you are still not in the elevator. Because they skip the queue, the waiting people have to wait longer, maybe your spot in the elevator was taken by one of the high payers. - show room was closed - the outside terrace was closed - the service and the staff processes have to optimize a lot I think - started at the end of the queue at 16.30, to see the Sunset. We arrived round about 17.45 in the 118th floor. Then it was dark night. The windows are reflecting the inside light so the pictures you make are always with co-displayed with people around you - downstairs same procedure: another QUEUE, the second one. A little bit faster downstairs, round about 45min, but still too much time lost. The sightviewing floors are big enough, there was no hustle, so the main problem was the ONE and ONLY elevator (of obviously 2) which was opened for the mass of visitors. - the 2 walk with bottom glas view are not that impressive because you know you are standing on glas, all the floor glasses are full of scratches - in the queue: NO SITTING  Conclusion: Lack of process optimization. Great view but just go there when you have enough time and air in your lungs or enough money in your pocket to buy you a fast lane ticket! Go there early enough to see the city by daylight and take some pictures without reflecting of the night indoor lights. Prepare it to the Eiffel Tower in Paris it isnt that irritating like in Lotte Tower or the Empire State Building in N.Y., there are timeslots there and you can buy the tickets simply online, in english! My opinion!  To the operators: this stay (2019) in Seoul we decided to stay at Park Hyatt Hotel but we had also considered the Signiel Hotel. The best view was the most important factor in this years hotel choice. Next year, i do travel to Korea once a year because of my family, it won’t be the Signiel again. For sure!",174,nothing
175,7,423,"This is one of the tallest buildings in the world where you can have a panoramic view of Seoul and the famous Han River. On 118/F, it's time to show your courage! The glass floor is there waiting for courageous men to step on it! Looking down through the glass can make you shake and worried if the glass breaks at any second you are staying on it! I was just so amazed how kids fear nothing - they lay on it and they even jumped up and down! ""STOP PLEASE!!!"" I screamed in my heart!  Tip: Check the sunset time and plan your trip. It admits limited people in each time slot so reserve your ticket early. Sunset view on the glass is the definite thing you want to try!",175,nothing
176,8,438,"We accidentally came across this mall. A mall is a mall, so nothing special about the shops. However, the basement where the supermarket is located, there were heaps of food stalls. It was food galore for us. Koreans delights and great food for lunch!",176,nothing
