0,0,31, Since it has not been restored yet you may think that it is more flat than other palaces and lacks much to see It seemed to show the pain of our history in its own way ,0,much
1,1,127, Its not as spacious as Gyeongbokgung Palace and theres not much to see but the buildings where East and West meet are new and pretty ,1,much
2,2,136, Its not too big and its great to take a walk and enjoy I am very much looking forward to the flowers that will bloom one after another such as cherry blossom peony wisteria and pear tree ,2,much
3,3,174, It may not seem like much but once you step inside there is something unusual about the weight of history ,3,much
4,4,249,A small palace compared to that of Gyeongbukgung and Changdeokgung This palace is perfect for those who wanted to visit one but do not have much time The palace allows visitors to understand the ancient Korean culture There is a change of guard ceremony at fixed timings here,4,much
5,5,251,There is a common believe that most South Korean Temples look pretty much alike and that is an undeniable truth Nonetheless there is a hidden differential beauty on each one of them Here at this temple we could appreciate the differences  This palace also has a lot of dynamic history as has been occupied not only by the Korean Royal family In 1897 after the incident when Emperor Gojong took refuge in the Russian legation he returned to this place and named it Gyeongungung again During the Japanese occupation of Korea in 1592 the residential buildings became a temporary royal residence after all the other palaces were destroyed by fires  Many of the structures here have since been removed or sold In 1933 all buildings except for a few central and western style buildings were removed It was then made a park and opened to the public  At the end of the trail you may walk youll find a turquoise Blue Fountain European looking On the left of this you will find a smaller part of the palace detached unit and on the right of the fountain youll be right in front of the Deoksugung National Museum of Modern  Contemporary Art  Its important at the door to purchase the full package ticket so that you can appreciate both Palace and Museum  Since 2007 restoration work to restore Deoksugung Palace to its original specifications  This work has been ongoing We do recommend extensively this palace although we couldnt appreciate the full beauty as it has been a bitter winter this January but in Spring must be definitely wonderful  Dont miss it,5,much
6,6,256,This is a much smaller palace as compared to the grand Gyeongbokgung palace and is in the heart of the city We landed there just in time for the changing of the guards ceremony which is again not as elaborate as the one at Gyeongbokgung but is still nice You can watch the ceremony from the street You need a ticket only to enter the palace grounds The visit does not take much time as the palace grounds are small The guide pointed out to us some of the structures dating back to 1600,6,much
7,7,278,Dropped by here because it was on our way and walked the grounds A few beautiful nature corners and buildings are pictureworthy as usual Otherwise not much to see here but if its on your way its worth stopping by,7,much
8,8,299,This palace and the surrounding grounds are much smaller than the nearby Gyeongbokgung Palace but it is still worth a visit if you have an hour or so to spare We arrived just as the changing of the guard ceremony was starting 11am which takes place just in front of the main gate There wasnt such a big crowd so we had a good view of the ceremony After that we took a walk around the westernstyle garden and the interesting buildings in different architectural styles Part of the site was under renovation but there was still plenty to see including the Modern Art Museum,8,much
9,9,308,Small place which only takes half an our or so to walk around Not much to see inside The main attraction is the changing of the guard ceremony It was excellent Lots of interesting uniforms to look at and excellent drummers,9,much
10,10,309,Deoksugung is a lot smaller than the other Seoul palaces Gyeongbokgung Changdeokgung but its still worth visiting Its much more quiet and offers a break from the city on a hot day Take you time and sit around for awhile observing locals and enjoying the scenery Since its centrally located Deoksugung also offers great views of traditional palace buildings with a bunch of modern skyscrapers in the background  a combination of old and new that makes Seoul so interesting,10,much
11,11,311,We visited as we had a little time and were in the area It is cheap to visit but there isnt much to see compared to the other palaces The changing of the guard ceremony is fun to watch and there is an explanation of what is happening in English There is some information about the buildings in English but not very much I would say it isnt worth going if you only have a few days in the city but stop by if you will be around for a week or more,11,much
12,12,316,Deoksugung palace is very interesting palace for me Beside the location that in the middle of the city and just next to city hall the palace was very easy to reach This palace also smaller than the other two Ive been visited But its nice to started your palace tour with this one  Its like past and present met in one place There are few historic pavilions and yet there are modern and western buildings in same complex  Very interesting for see but not much to explore But its very nice experience especially if you came when the guard changing ceremony  Extra info  When you get hungry and need something to snack on you can try waffles just next to it,12,much
13,13,317,This grounds of this palace are much smaller than most of the others in the city Entrance is only 1000kr however despite the bargain price this place is relatively empty This allows you to stroll the grounds and take numerous photos without the hoards of tourists which you will find in the other palaces,13,much
14,14,340,We managed to secure tickets for the Secret Garden in Deoksugung on our first day in Seoul and all other days for our Seoul trip was sold out While the weather forecast was not good we proceeded on to visit this palace and its garden  Of course it would be a much better visit in gorgeous autumn weather but we managed to enjoy the gardens and the castle complex with its spectacular foliage before the huge downpour Do allow at least half a day in good weather to fully appreciate this complex,14,much
15,15,353,This palace is near City Hall and costs W1000 to enter It is closed on Mondays  There are free guided tours in English twice a day at 1030  1330  The palace was the home of two kings the first in the 16th17th centuries and then again in the 19th20th centuries  The best building is the Throne room which has exquisite dragon carvings on the ceiling  Note that the complex houses the Seokjojeon Hall Anybody can visit the basement  not much to see there particularly if you cant read Korean The best parts are the first and second floors But you have to book on the site webpage in advance Or for foreigners there is a special rule to allow up to five to sign up on a waiting list first come first served This hall was built in about 1910 and is a mixture of western and Korean styles The hall is now the Daehan Empire History Museum and is definitely worth a visit The visit is guided and should take about 45 minutes  Time to visit would be up to an hour longer if you go into the hall,15,much
16,16,360,Stayed for a few days in the Plaza hotel which is just in front Deoksugung and was curious to know what is inside  Entrance fee is quite affordable and you get a decent guide for the different buildings however personally I enjoyed much more relaxing under the shadow of the trees just enjoying the view than learn about the history of the place,16,much
17,17,391,As I have done most of the palaces this one didnt have anything special no must see factor until I went round the Historical Museum This was the tick in the box for this Palace The w1000 also includes the museum and if you want to walk round head over as soon as you arrive and get yourself on a tour It is access by tour only and they leave every 30 minutes but gets full quick as the groups are only small Shoes off and slippers on they gave me an English audio so I could follow round but obviously the passionate guide was giving the locals much more than I was hearing All renovated in the last 10 years but decorated as best as they could from old photos and with some of the original furniture The history you get is the best thing and even some photos of the old emperors and emperoresses Your 1000 doesnt also get you into the art gallery that will cost you more,17,much
18,18,396,Being the smallest one among the four palaces I got to in Seoul not sure how it compares in size with Gyeonghuigung which is the only one that I didnt get to among Seouls five palaces this is not a palace like Gyeongbokgung which is kind of a world of its own with its huge grounds where youll get an immersion experience of the Joseon era days but what this palace offers just because of its significantly smaller grounds compared to Gyeongbokgung is nice contrasting views of traditional palace buildings  their modern highrise counterparts right outside the confines of the palace grounds including the interestingshaped allglass structure of Seoul City Hall which can be seen from the raised platform around the main palace building which will kind of give you an idea how far Korea has come from those days of the Joseon Dynasty And those relatively small grounds of the Palace actually merge on one side to the left of the main palace building while facing it or equivalently to your right if you go all the way to the end of the pathway from the entrance gate after coming in from the street with the grounds of a big museum with a lovely fountain in front although Im not sure if the museum is considered part of the Palace for admission purposes or if it can be entered from another side  And unlike at the other palaces the main building of this palace can be entered not just to look at from right outside so you can get a closeup view of the throne stage Also present here at the entrance gate are two or three ceremonial guards didnt see them on the way in at about 10 am though only saw them on the way out about an hour later but Im sure theres no big ceremony involving a lot of guardsmen in colorful attires with some holding beautiful flags as at Gyeongbokgung since theres simply no space here for such a ceremony  Coming by subway City Hall Station Lines 1  2 is where to get off and youre pretty much right outside the Palace once you get out of the station onto the big street Sejong Daero just a 1to2minute walk to the entrance gate And what I suggest for the ticket is getting an integrated ticket for 10000 won the equivalent of 10 US dollars which is good for like a month and which gives you admission to four of Seouls five palaces except for Gyeonghuigung which Im sure is a small one maybe even smaller than this one  Jongmyo Shrine; also do keep in mind that this palace along with Changdeokgung  Changgyeonggung are closed on Mondays whereas the main palace Gyeongbokgung  Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays,18,much
19,19,440,I didnt expect much from this palace its small a third of its original size and gives an impression of a lessthankorean palace sibce there are modern buildings in it BUT It has difinitely exceeded my expectation Firstly it was considerably less crowded than Gyeongbukgung even in its peak time which is 11 am when the Changing of the Guard takes place Secondly the Changing of the guard is a wonderful experience you can follow the marching band around and watch the change comfortably and then even pause a few times to let you take photos with the guards Thirdly the history of the different buildings that compile the palace is very interesting One of the buildings is a fusion between traditional korean architecture and imperial architecture and to my opinion it was spectacular  For the meek price of 1000 won I recommend going I arrived around 920am so I even managed to get a free english tour with a guide before following the marching band  Overall I spent 3 hours exploring including the guard change and half a guided tour,19,much
20,20,451,You cant help but notice when visiting this ancient Palace that you are surrounded by modern day high rises in the heart of the city  This was a very popular Palace for school children to visit as there had to be several hundred children on site  The grounds are very nice and much bigger than expected There is a mixture of Western and Korean architecture Make sure to grab the brochure expaling everything at the entrance way  Definitely worth a look Very cheap to get in only 1000 won but free if you are 65 or older,20,much
21,21,458,This Palace one of four major Palaces in the same vicinity in Seoul is pretty much directly opposite City Hall and theres a metro station at City Hall so its easy to get to and find This is a smaller Palace than some of the others and has a few more laterbuilt buildings so is quite distinct from the other Palaces The Palace guards are interesting to see and photograph and you dont have to buy a ticket to go into the Palace to see them as for obvious reasons they are on the outside of the gate They are used to having their photos taken As a consequence you can also see much of the changing of the guards from the street too free of charge much like Buckingham Palace And the changing of the guards at Deoksugung and at Gyeongbokgung not far up the road for that matter has just as much pomp and ceremony with colourful uniforms and a marching band as Buckingham Palace or Horseguards Well worth a look if you can time it right,21,much
22,22,471,We choose to visit Deoksugung because of its size We would like to be able to tour the ground and thought that Gyeongbok and Changdeok is too much for our group of elderly and small children to walk through and cover all  We arrive exactly as the changing of the guard ceremony is about to start at 11 am and lucky enough to find a booth in front of the main gate that offer services of young korean student for a free tour to tourist They were official and looked very professional with their orange uniform and obviously they get the support from the local govt The purpose is to practise their english with foreigners and to learn more of their own culture which I thought were very nice  Sara our guide was only 14 years old about the same age as my eldest daughter thus they were instantly having a girl talk  she showed us around the palace complex stopped every now and then to explain about the buildings and their history  The complex also has a museum but we choose not to go in so cant comment on that one,22,much
23,23,474,located near the city hall good to walk around and see korean palace Convenient access but nothing much to do there,23,much
24,24,480,It might not be the most impressive of the palaces in Seoul but its still worth a visit and entry really doesnt cost much at all You probably dont need to spend much more than an hour there and definitely not more than two but the architecture alone is worth the price of admission even without taking into consideration the historical importance of the palace Signs are in English Korean Japanese and Chinese so almost any visitor can learn about the historical details,24,much
25,25,481,It was a very cold day  0 degrees so my walk around the grounds was brisk The entry fee is only 1000 won about 150 AUD so inexpensive  There are free tours leaving twice a day and there are brochures just inside the gates in English There are a number of plaques dotted about that have a short paragraph in English explaining the relevance which is very useful Overall it is a peaceful place that was largely empty in December and is was easy to stroll around and look at the gardens although they are pretty bare in winter  The grounds also house the Daehan Empire History museum which has tours of the 1st and second floors of the palace I peeked through the windows was worth a look if you like palaces and you can reserve your place in the free queue almost every hour  I didnt know this before I went so the tours were full Check it out before you go the rooms looked lovely In the ground level was a museum about the history of the dynasty Im not really sure there was an english brochure which didnt explain much and none of the displays had english translations so I am not sure what it was about Give it a miss if you are in a hurry although it is nice to get in outside from the cold  The changing of the guard was at 11am and I was able to see them marching from behind the hall all the way through the gardens to the outside gate Ignore the cheapskates who say to not pay go in and see it It was a good spectacle  Allow about an hour and there are plenty of toilets and drinking fountains throughout as well as a few vending machines if you want a quick drink or snack,25,much
26,26,489,Deoksugung 1000 for adults is one of the Five Grand Palaces of the Joseon Dynasty located next to Seoul Plaza and City Hall in the city centre Opening hours are 9am to 9pm closed Mondays  This palace served as the residence of the Royal family twice during late 16th century and then again at the turn of the 20th century providing well preserved buildings of traditional Korean and Western architecture  Here you will find a collection of traditional Korean style entrance gates lovely inner courtyards worship and residential halls pavilions and landscaping all quite similar to what you see at the much larger Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces You can also watch Changing of the Guards ceremonies here at Daehanmun Gate  Two unique inclusions at Deoksugung include the Western style buildings at Seogeodong Hall which was built in European style in 1910 and the adjacent building used to house the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art MMCA  Deoksugung branch  One of the things we very much enjoyed about visiting Deoksugung during the autumn was the fantastic fall foliage display seen throughout the palace grounds There were numerous spots where we found multiple colours of tree leaves that made for lovely photographs The autumn scene here was considerably more impressive here than at other palace grounds visited during this trip to Seoul  We were however disappointed to find the MMCA Deoksugung Art Museum closed during the time of our visit There was no indicated closing on the MMCA or Deoksugung websites nor at the place entrance which was odd  Overall we quite enjoyed spending time at the Deoksugung Palace Not only was it exceptionally beautiful this time of year but we found it more management a place to visit compared to larger palace grounds around Seoul You can comfortably browse Deoksugung in 3045 minutes or longer if you want to visit more leisurely This is a very good and cheap attraction visit to consider making during trips to Seoul,26,much
27,27,504,At the time of my visit the main hall was completely under wraps for renovation That said you may find \xe2\x80\x93 as I did \xe2\x80\x93 that this compound offers more of a cool leafy break from frantic downtown Seoul than a serious competitor to the other of Seouls palaces  It has very much of a parklike layout that seems to encourage relaxing and strolling The two main structures at the time I was there were the completely incongruous neo classical Museum of Modern Art and Royal Museum buildings \xe2\x80\x93 two structures which look like theyd be more at home in Washington DC than in Seoul  The entrance fee is very modest I believe 1000 Won so it is not a great financial investment to check it out particularly in the middle of a hot day I dont know if it is worth a special trip but if you have other sights nearby lined up then its logical to stop in,27,much
28,28,505,This is included if you get the combination Palace pass It is near City Hall It is very much like the other Palaces but very nice On reflection I would not get the combination pass as in my opinion you do not need to see them all as they are much the same,28,much
29,29,516,Unexpected quiet and serene palace beside a main 10 lane road The serenity was so relaxing The palace building were impressive However the best thing was the changing of the guard ceremony at 11am I did not know about it so was surprised when nearly run over by the parade Got a really good view and the ceremony had many parts Took about 25 minutes and was followed by a martial arts display There were a lot less tourists here so much more enjoyable,29,much
30,30,521,Gyeongbokgung Kyongbok may be the largest Joseon Choson dynasty palace in Seoul but Deoksugung Daekso Duksoo is perhaps the most charming The central palace itself is small and empty except for the throne in the middle of the throne room but the details on the roof are exquisite The small side buildings are also worth investigating including the bizarre hybrid turnofthecentury Russian gazebo behind the main palace building Make sure to check out the impressive Buddhist bells on the grounds of the palace The contrast with surrounding modern buildings is striking and makes for a good photo But the most impressive thing to see is actually the changing of the guard where sentinels in colorful Joseon dynasty costumes parade about in front of the entrance gate If you arrive 15 or 20 minutes before the changing of the guard go inside the palace grounds to see them marching out of the gate before beginning the ceremony After a short display of martial arts theres a moment when they allow tourists to have their pictures taken with the unsmiling guards; youll only have a few minutes so if youre interested be quick to take advantage of the opportunity Check in advance for the schedule for the changing of the guard Changdeokgung may have the Piwon Secret Garden  the single most interesting Joseon dynasty site in Seoul  but the grounds are enormous; Deoksugung is much more manageable and can easily be seen in an hour,30,much
31,31,522,I find that the most interesting thing about this palace compared to the others in Seoul is that shows the JoseonDaehan royal familys late attempts to Westernize which can be seen in the architecture Its a pity that so much of the palace was destroyed by the Japanese after King Gojong died The complex also contains one of the very few historic 2story buildings from old Korea Most buildings in traditional Korean architecture only had one floor,31,much
32,32,530,This palace is very small and not very interesting It consists of the entry gate a paved courtyard with a throne hall and another building in the traditional style There is also a tiny Europeanstyle garden and 2 large imposing neoclassical buildings built when Korea became an Empire at the end of the 19th century and opened up to the West One of these appeared to be an art museum with no identifiable entry from the palace grounds; the other Europeanstyle palace building was a mystery museum that was not mentioned in any guidebooks or the official Seoul Visitors Guide The sign in the front said a reservation was needed to see parts of the building but other parts could be seen without a reservation Upon entering this mystery building to visit the nonreservation parts I was ushered outside by the nonEnglish speaking staff before I could close the door behind me  clearly I was not welcome despite what was on the English signage The whole complex can probably be seen in 30mins or less The one redeeming feature of this otherwise boring place is the Changing of the Guard Ceremony This is the best show to see in Seoul and is very entertaining with a band martial arts display traditional dancing and military procedure It lasts close to 30 mins and is wellworth seeing The crowd control barriers are placed quite close to the ceremony so you get a much better view than at Gyeongbokgung,32,much
33,33,534,I have always wanted to see the inside of this palace Deoksugung was featured in the popular Korean drama called \xe2\x80\x9cGoong\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Hours\xe2\x80\x9d but its so much more than that Built in the late 14th Century this palace still stands today as a reminder of Koreas rich cultural past For less than the price of using the buses in South Korea people get to walk through the royal palace grounds and see the throne room of the king The mighty throne with two golden dragons swirled in the roof over the throne gives the feeling of power and might During my time there there were two young men who performed with long sabers in an intricate dance of the ancient kings warriors If youre a nature lover the trees bushes and flowers are absolutely breathtaking I highly recommend entering the courtyard in the center and walking down the stone path to kings throne room for that is the very path that many a foreign dignitary had taken The King had a separate room for his queen servants children guests and guards so there are many rooms to look inside of The sparse furniture used back then allows the visitors to see the traditional ways of life for the King It truly is a must see while taking a tour of Seouls historical sights,33,much
34,34,535,Theres not much to really say about shrines and palaces but I think the Jongmyo Shrine and Deoksugung Palace is definitely worthy of your visit Youre literally walking in world history and its something that many of us young folks have taken for granted,34,much
35,35,539,We went in November and it was raining and cold We were fortunate to arrive just in time for the changing of the guards The experience was terrific and we took advantage of the photo op We happened to take a tour earlier and had learned a lot about the significance of the architecture which made this tour more interesting for us Theres not actually so much to see the buildings are sparsely decorated and you cannot go inside them but it is worth seeing nonetheless if for no other reason than to see the changing of the guard,35,much
36,36,542,The Palace itself is not that interesting buildings that are empty of fixtures and fittings inside not much to see but the park is nice and there is a small cafe overlooking a lake The changing of the guard is great  such colourful costumes music and deliberate ceremony we loved it Over 65s get in for free and low cost for others Worth turning up for the ceremony which takes place at the entrance to the palace so no need to go inside,36,much
37,37,547,Deoksugung Palace and gardens is a mustsee in the middle of Seoul  just across from the City Hall  Seoul Plaza The entrance is via the impressive Sumumjang gate where a changing of the guard ceremony is regularly held Entrance is cheap  free if you are 65 or over and have a passport or driving license They sell a handy little guide book which will fit in your pocket and costs just 500 Won Over the years much restoration work has been needed reflecting Koreas troubled past and rather inconvenient neighbours But the various structures are well worth looking at and on a fine day with the trees in blossom it is a magical place to stroll round,37,much
38,38,550,Well here is the main place in Seoul I recommend for a couple or family Here is much smaller than Gwanghwamun Gate near here Especially Seokjojeon Hall I love this place,38,much
39,39,556,This is a very nice park to sit and walk in and the added bonus are the palace buildings This part of Seoul has limited green space left over and it allows you even in the winter to sit in a bit of peace for as little as US 1  It has a number of nicer building to look at  one always wonders how much is really old and how much has been restored  And with respect to the ceremonial guards  checkout all the glued on moustaches and beards ;,39,much
40,40,557,Most hotels concierge will tell you theres nothing much to see here But this palace is quiet has a mix of architecture styles and is quite interesting Do not miss the changing of guards ceremony and check with hotel the timings especially during winter if too cold apparently there is no ceremony In the Seokjojeon hall theres an interesting guided tour foreigners follow the Korean group with audio guide about King Gojong and his son Sunjong the last monarch of Korea Sadly the Korean tour moves very quickly from room to room and those listening to audio guides are ushered out to another room before its finished The audio guide is very informative,40,much
41,41,578,This is the palace that you can and should see in the evening when the lights turn it into a kind of magic The best 1 admission ever And in a city where so much is rebuilt this has some original buildings,41,much
42,42,592,A beautiful place to sit back and relax but if you are after Temples and dont have much time in seoul I would not suggest this to be the best out of the lot  Its a nice place to have a cold drink and read a book this temple is included in the 5 palaces in one ticket,42,much
43,43,596,This is a very small property since much of the original Palace land has been sold off for development The buildings that still exist are nice and there is an english brochure available for 500 won Admission is only 1000 won for adults The whole thing can be seen in under an hour Inside the walls it is very peaceful you can bring a lunch and enjoy a nice meal on one of the benches,43,much
44,44,597,Following our visit to Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung we had some time to visit Deoksugung The history of this palace is covered extensively elsewhere and all the practical information required is in the excellent KTO page httpenglishvisitkoreaorkrenuSISI_EN_3_1_1_1jspcid264316  We bought an Integrated Ticket of Palaces which covers Changdeokgung Changgyeonggung Deoksugung Gyeongbokgung and Jongmyo Shrine This was excellent value at 10000 won  After the history lessons at the first two much larger palaces we did not join a tour as the palace is small enough to wander around independently with notes from your guidebook It is situated in delightful gardens with many seats dotted around so you can bring a picnic or rest your weary feet if you have been shopping too much in the nearby area  There is also a Changing of the Guards ceremony at this palace and the National Museum of Contemporary Art is in the same compound  Although this palace is not as big as Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung I gave it a five star rating because of its convenient location right in the centre of a shopping area which means you can just pop in for a quick visit and get some history and culture along with some art as well,44,much
45,45,601,Situated in the center of the city right at the subway exit Not a very big one which makes it a good choice when you dont have much time but still want to do some sightseeing Entrance is only 1 but theres additional charge for entering the museum located inside Pretty crowded among netizens during lunch time Make sure to check the schedule of changing guards ceremony outside the main gate,45,much
46,46,611,What a pleasant surprise tucked next to City Hall an elaborate and accessible Changing Of The Guards ceremony apparently running all the time; very inexpensive ticket price; immaculately restored and kept grounds and buildings all in a compact space Perfect for the tourist with limited time this gives a reasonable idea of the architecture and style of the glory days of Korea just as the Japanese were taking over There is a constant delicious juxtaposition of the spacious grounds surrounded by the totems of modern life shopping malls and skyscrapers Unlike the much bigger Gyeongbokgung palace where one may feel at times transported to the 17th century at the DeoksuGung you always see the context  the value Korea places on its history and its future both A further plus is the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art tucked in the back of the grounds like a forgotten relative Quite tame and not really very modern the museum is now showing Masterpieces of Modern Korean Painting an interesting set of tableaux clearly designed for a Koreanlanguage audience Still its worth a visit,46,much
47,47,617,Not the biggest palace but right in town and can done quickly if you dont have too much time try to assist to the guards shift change quite entertaining and explained in English,47,much
48,48,620,I enjoyed this Palace lots of history I arrived by subwayline 1 to City Hall the station stop was right at the entrance to the Palace Entrance fee was only KRW3000 which was well worth it there is so much to explore Be sure to check out the Changing of the Guard Ceremony which they do several times a day not to be missed there is also a very interesting Museum and a gift shop which offers some very colorful gifts After visiting Deoksugung check out Namdaemun Market which is a short walk away you will find anything here also a great place to grab a bite to eat,48,much
49,49,626,Deoksugung literally means the Palace of Virtue and Longevity in Korean or Chinese It is not well known that the Chinese was very much the official language in Korea although King Sejong created the Korean scripts in the late 15th century  I will mention the modern dimension first The place is near the City Hall One building houses the national museum of art which is not worthy its great name but holds special exhibitions I was impressed by a modern Korean painter who adopted Western techniques in his paintings Also Western style was introduced into the architecture and landscape in the compound  Without knowing the history one will not find the palace particularly interesting So let me add a historical flavor This place was used as royal places twice First was during the Korean resistance to the Japanese invasion at the end of the 16th century Since all others palaces were burned this place served as royal palace for a while It became a royal palace again after King Gojong ended his yearlong refuge in the Russian embassy in 1907 Gojong ascended the throne at the young age in 1863 and was under the influence or control of his father and later his wife He declared himself an emperor but was forced by Japanese to abdicate the throne to his son the last emperor His death and Wilsons 14 Points in January 1919 triggered the March First Movement which aimed at Korean independence,49,much
50,50,657,My wife and I visited Deoksugung Palace one icy cold afternoon It was in walking distance from our hotel in Myeongdong although I later learned that it was also just one station away The palace is probably the smallest or one of the smaller in Seoul but we found it romantic The grounds were very spacious and full of trees and the architecture was colourful as with other palaces Not much to see to be honest other than a few palace buildings and the changing of the guard ceremony But there is an museam inside the palace ground that provided interesting viewing and respite from the freezing cold There is also a lovely walk around the outer walls of the palace that we thoroughly enjoyed During that walk we had a fantastic lunch at the organic restaurant that is located at the theatre If you time your visit to the palace well you can follow it up with this walk late lunch at the restaurant and a theatre show So Deoksugung is okay on its own but great and conveniently fitted in as part of a walk of the area Do it,50,much
51,0,317,This grounds of this palace are much smaller than most of the others in the city Entrance is only 1000kr however despite the bargain price this place is relatively empty This allows you to stroll the grounds and take numerous photos without the hoards of tourists which you will find in the other palaces,51,empty
52,1,379,Im not sure why its listed as a separate attraction since its part of the palace one of many buildings in the palace The buildings are replicas and are empty The story we were given is that they are afraid that if they furnish the place the furniture could be used as weapons,52,empty
53,2,481,It was a very cold day  0 degrees so my walk around the grounds was brisk The entry fee is only 1000 won about 150 AUD so inexpensive  There are free tours leaving twice a day and there are brochures just inside the gates in English There are a number of plaques dotted about that have a short paragraph in English explaining the relevance which is very useful Overall it is a peaceful place that was largely empty in December and is was easy to stroll around and look at the gardens although they are pretty bare in winter  The grounds also house the Daehan Empire History museum which has tours of the 1st and second floors of the palace I peeked through the windows was worth a look if you like palaces and you can reserve your place in the free queue almost every hour  I didnt know this before I went so the tours were full Check it out before you go the rooms looked lovely In the ground level was a museum about the history of the dynasty Im not really sure there was an english brochure which didnt explain much and none of the displays had english translations so I am not sure what it was about Give it a miss if you are in a hurry although it is nice to get in outside from the cold  The changing of the guard was at 11am and I was able to see them marching from behind the hall all the way through the gardens to the outside gate Ignore the cheapskates who say to not pay go in and see it It was a good spectacle  Allow about an hour and there are plenty of toilets and drinking fountains throughout as well as a few vending machines if you want a quick drink or snack,53,empty
54,3,521,Gyeongbokgung Kyongbok may be the largest Joseon Choson dynasty palace in Seoul but Deoksugung Daekso Duksoo is perhaps the most charming The central palace itself is small and empty except for the throne in the middle of the throne room but the details on the roof are exquisite The small side buildings are also worth investigating including the bizarre hybrid turnofthecentury Russian gazebo behind the main palace building Make sure to check out the impressive Buddhist bells on the grounds of the palace The contrast with surrounding modern buildings is striking and makes for a good photo But the most impressive thing to see is actually the changing of the guard where sentinels in colorful Joseon dynasty costumes parade about in front of the entrance gate If you arrive 15 or 20 minutes before the changing of the guard go inside the palace grounds to see them marching out of the gate before beginning the ceremony After a short display of martial arts theres a moment when they allow tourists to have their pictures taken with the unsmiling guards; youll only have a few minutes so if youre interested be quick to take advantage of the opportunity Check in advance for the schedule for the changing of the guard Changdeokgung may have the Piwon Secret Garden  the single most interesting Joseon dynasty site in Seoul  but the grounds are enormous; Deoksugung is much more manageable and can easily be seen in an hour,54,empty
55,4,542,The Palace itself is not that interesting buildings that are empty of fixtures and fittings inside not much to see but the park is nice and there is a small cafe overlooking a lake The changing of the guard is great  such colourful costumes music and deliberate ceremony we loved it Over 65s get in for free and low cost for others Worth turning up for the ceremony which takes place at the entrance to the palace so no need to go inside,55,empty
56,5,552,I went here around 930 AM and it was nearempty People say that you should wait till later to avoid to tour groups but there was probably 5 other people here when I visited This palace grounds is amazingly preserved and it shows the traditional architecture of the Joseon Dynasty I highly recommend buying the combination ticket for the other palaces if you are going to visit them as well It costs 10000 Won 10 USD,56,empty
57,6,595,You will find almost nothing but empty palaces The pattern is nice but its can be seen in other places in Korea Ticket is cheap just 1000 KRW but really that cheap is not worth,57,empty
58,0,281,The ground was not as big as Changdeokgung palace but it was one of our most enjoyable places visited in Seoul mainly because we were given free guided tour and we were also allowed free use of hanbok the traditional South Korean dress After the Royal Guard changing ceremony there was announcement to encourage picture taking with the palace guards which we did while wearing our hanbok  Tip Changing of the guard ceremony is held at 1100 1400 and 1530 closed on Mondays Try to get there at least an hour before the changing of the guard if you want a free guided tour We were there just after 1000am where we saw this youth group who are offering free guided tour At this time the group managing the free hanbok were not yet available We took the tour which was only the tour guide and myself and my wife so it is practically a private tour The guided tour took about 45mins After the tour we went out of the palace and proceeded to the stall of the group that is offering free hanbok We registered and was fitted with hanbok  both my wife and myself We were wearing the hanbok during and after the changing of the guard ceremony and took plenty of pictures of us wearing them  Please note The stall for the free guided tour and the hanbok experiences are NOT inside the palace They are at the left front side of the palace gate,58,mainly
59,0,98, Its been a while since Ive visited but I was disappointed because the cultural assets buildings were not well maintained Maintenance and cleaning of the exterior walls of the building is required What does the ,59,disappointed
60,1,489,Deoksugung 1000 for adults is one of the Five Grand Palaces of the Joseon Dynasty located next to Seoul Plaza and City Hall in the city centre Opening hours are 9am to 9pm closed Mondays  This palace served as the residence of the Royal family twice during late 16th century and then again at the turn of the 20th century providing well preserved buildings of traditional Korean and Western architecture  Here you will find a collection of traditional Korean style entrance gates lovely inner courtyards worship and residential halls pavilions and landscaping all quite similar to what you see at the much larger Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces You can also watch Changing of the Guards ceremonies here at Daehanmun Gate  Two unique inclusions at Deoksugung include the Western style buildings at Seogeodong Hall which was built in European style in 1910 and the adjacent building used to house the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art MMCA  Deoksugung branch  One of the things we very much enjoyed about visiting Deoksugung during the autumn was the fantastic fall foliage display seen throughout the palace grounds There were numerous spots where we found multiple colours of tree leaves that made for lovely photographs The autumn scene here was considerably more impressive here than at other palace grounds visited during this trip to Seoul  We were however disappointed to find the MMCA Deoksugung Art Museum closed during the time of our visit There was no indicated closing on the MMCA or Deoksugung websites nor at the place entrance which was odd  Overall we quite enjoyed spending time at the Deoksugung Palace Not only was it exceptionally beautiful this time of year but we found it more management a place to visit compared to larger palace grounds around Seoul You can comfortably browse Deoksugung in 3045 minutes or longer if you want to visit more leisurely This is a very good and cheap attraction visit to consider making during trips to Seoul,60,disappointed
61,2,647,There are many palaces in Seoul and unless you are spending a long period of time there impossible to visit all so I chose 2 that I thought would have colorful changing of guards ceremonies and I was not disappointed with Deoksugung The Palace is located on the main street of Sejong and more importantly right across the street from Seoul City Hall and Seoul Park You can take the number 1 train green line or the number 2 train dark blue line and get off at the city hall stop Take exit 2 or 3 from the station and once thru the turnstiles look for and elevator It will let you off at street level directly in front of the Palace Check for the times of the changing of the guards but they are listed at 1100 200 and 330 It seems it may be more frequent as I was in that area a number of times for other attractions and it always seemed to be going on Position your self more to the left of the entrance as the procession enters from the stoned and brick side street to the left of the Palace especially if you want to take pics I videoed the ceremony with my Ipad and the pics were great This is a must for any visit to Seoul something that friends and family back home will appreciate Not something you see everyday The grounds of the Palace are spacious and clean but looks barren The day we visited the Museum and another building were closed for renovations and there were very few people on the grounds There are many trees offering shade if a warm day and a teacoffee house toward the back with tables and chairs outside It was just peaceful to sit and look around at all the history and culture of Korean royalty There are a number of buildings to view although the landscaped grounds were not as beautiful as Gyeongbokgung,61,disappointed
62,3,661,Im not disappointed with this place Poor raying is just means i did not go there frequently this place has good wave and atmosphere convinient and relaxed feeling comes to me when In there,62,disappointed
63,0,31, Since it has not been restored yet you may think that it is more flat than other palaces and lacks much to see It seemed to show the pain of our history in its own way ,63,much
64,1,127, Its not as spacious as Gyeongbokgung Palace and theres not much to see but the buildings where East and West meet are new and pretty ,64,much
65,2,136, Its not too big and its great to take a walk and enjoy I am very much looking forward to the flowers that will bloom one after another such as cherry blossom peony wisteria and pear tree ,65,much
66,3,174, It may not seem like much but once you step inside there is something unusual about the weight of history ,66,much
67,4,249,A small palace compared to that of Gyeongbukgung and Changdeokgung This palace is perfect for those who wanted to visit one but do not have much time The palace allows visitors to understand the ancient Korean culture There is a change of guard ceremony at fixed timings here,67,much
68,5,251,There is a common believe that most South Korean Temples look pretty much alike and that is an undeniable truth Nonetheless there is a hidden differential beauty on each one of them Here at this temple we could appreciate the differences  This palace also has a lot of dynamic history as has been occupied not only by the Korean Royal family In 1897 after the incident when Emperor Gojong took refuge in the Russian legation he returned to this place and named it Gyeongungung again During the Japanese occupation of Korea in 1592 the residential buildings became a temporary royal residence after all the other palaces were destroyed by fires  Many of the structures here have since been removed or sold In 1933 all buildings except for a few central and western style buildings were removed It was then made a park and opened to the public  At the end of the trail you may walk youll find a turquoise Blue Fountain European looking On the left of this you will find a smaller part of the palace detached unit and on the right of the fountain youll be right in front of the Deoksugung National Museum of Modern  Contemporary Art  Its important at the door to purchase the full package ticket so that you can appreciate both Palace and Museum  Since 2007 restoration work to restore Deoksugung Palace to its original specifications  This work has been ongoing We do recommend extensively this palace although we couldnt appreciate the full beauty as it has been a bitter winter this January but in Spring must be definitely wonderful  Dont miss it,68,much
69,6,256,This is a much smaller palace as compared to the grand Gyeongbokgung palace and is in the heart of the city We landed there just in time for the changing of the guards ceremony which is again not as elaborate as the one at Gyeongbokgung but is still nice You can watch the ceremony from the street You need a ticket only to enter the palace grounds The visit does not take much time as the palace grounds are small The guide pointed out to us some of the structures dating back to 1600,69,much
70,7,278,Dropped by here because it was on our way and walked the grounds A few beautiful nature corners and buildings are pictureworthy as usual Otherwise not much to see here but if its on your way its worth stopping by,70,much
71,8,299,This palace and the surrounding grounds are much smaller than the nearby Gyeongbokgung Palace but it is still worth a visit if you have an hour or so to spare We arrived just as the changing of the guard ceremony was starting 11am which takes place just in front of the main gate There wasnt such a big crowd so we had a good view of the ceremony After that we took a walk around the westernstyle garden and the interesting buildings in different architectural styles Part of the site was under renovation but there was still plenty to see including the Modern Art Museum,71,much
72,9,308,Small place which only takes half an our or so to walk around Not much to see inside The main attraction is the changing of the guard ceremony It was excellent Lots of interesting uniforms to look at and excellent drummers,72,much
73,10,309,Deoksugung is a lot smaller than the other Seoul palaces Gyeongbokgung Changdeokgung but its still worth visiting Its much more quiet and offers a break from the city on a hot day Take you time and sit around for awhile observing locals and enjoying the scenery Since its centrally located Deoksugung also offers great views of traditional palace buildings with a bunch of modern skyscrapers in the background  a combination of old and new that makes Seoul so interesting,73,much
74,11,311,We visited as we had a little time and were in the area It is cheap to visit but there isnt much to see compared to the other palaces The changing of the guard ceremony is fun to watch and there is an explanation of what is happening in English There is some information about the buildings in English but not very much I would say it isnt worth going if you only have a few days in the city but stop by if you will be around for a week or more,74,much
75,12,316,Deoksugung palace is very interesting palace for me Beside the location that in the middle of the city and just next to city hall the palace was very easy to reach This palace also smaller than the other two Ive been visited But its nice to started your palace tour with this one  Its like past and present met in one place There are few historic pavilions and yet there are modern and western buildings in same complex  Very interesting for see but not much to explore But its very nice experience especially if you came when the guard changing ceremony  Extra info  When you get hungry and need something to snack on you can try waffles just next to it,75,much
76,13,317,This grounds of this palace are much smaller than most of the others in the city Entrance is only 1000kr however despite the bargain price this place is relatively empty This allows you to stroll the grounds and take numerous photos without the hoards of tourists which you will find in the other palaces,76,much
77,14,340,We managed to secure tickets for the Secret Garden in Deoksugung on our first day in Seoul and all other days for our Seoul trip was sold out While the weather forecast was not good we proceeded on to visit this palace and its garden  Of course it would be a much better visit in gorgeous autumn weather but we managed to enjoy the gardens and the castle complex with its spectacular foliage before the huge downpour Do allow at least half a day in good weather to fully appreciate this complex,77,much
78,15,353,This palace is near City Hall and costs W1000 to enter It is closed on Mondays  There are free guided tours in English twice a day at 1030  1330  The palace was the home of two kings the first in the 16th17th centuries and then again in the 19th20th centuries  The best building is the Throne room which has exquisite dragon carvings on the ceiling  Note that the complex houses the Seokjojeon Hall Anybody can visit the basement  not much to see there particularly if you cant read Korean The best parts are the first and second floors But you have to book on the site webpage in advance Or for foreigners there is a special rule to allow up to five to sign up on a waiting list first come first served This hall was built in about 1910 and is a mixture of western and Korean styles The hall is now the Daehan Empire History Museum and is definitely worth a visit The visit is guided and should take about 45 minutes  Time to visit would be up to an hour longer if you go into the hall,78,much
79,16,360,Stayed for a few days in the Plaza hotel which is just in front Deoksugung and was curious to know what is inside  Entrance fee is quite affordable and you get a decent guide for the different buildings however personally I enjoyed much more relaxing under the shadow of the trees just enjoying the view than learn about the history of the place,79,much
80,17,391,As I have done most of the palaces this one didnt have anything special no must see factor until I went round the Historical Museum This was the tick in the box for this Palace The w1000 also includes the museum and if you want to walk round head over as soon as you arrive and get yourself on a tour It is access by tour only and they leave every 30 minutes but gets full quick as the groups are only small Shoes off and slippers on they gave me an English audio so I could follow round but obviously the passionate guide was giving the locals much more than I was hearing All renovated in the last 10 years but decorated as best as they could from old photos and with some of the original furniture The history you get is the best thing and even some photos of the old emperors and emperoresses Your 1000 doesnt also get you into the art gallery that will cost you more,80,much
81,18,396,Being the smallest one among the four palaces I got to in Seoul not sure how it compares in size with Gyeonghuigung which is the only one that I didnt get to among Seouls five palaces this is not a palace like Gyeongbokgung which is kind of a world of its own with its huge grounds where youll get an immersion experience of the Joseon era days but what this palace offers just because of its significantly smaller grounds compared to Gyeongbokgung is nice contrasting views of traditional palace buildings  their modern highrise counterparts right outside the confines of the palace grounds including the interestingshaped allglass structure of Seoul City Hall which can be seen from the raised platform around the main palace building which will kind of give you an idea how far Korea has come from those days of the Joseon Dynasty And those relatively small grounds of the Palace actually merge on one side to the left of the main palace building while facing it or equivalently to your right if you go all the way to the end of the pathway from the entrance gate after coming in from the street with the grounds of a big museum with a lovely fountain in front although Im not sure if the museum is considered part of the Palace for admission purposes or if it can be entered from another side  And unlike at the other palaces the main building of this palace can be entered not just to look at from right outside so you can get a closeup view of the throne stage Also present here at the entrance gate are two or three ceremonial guards didnt see them on the way in at about 10 am though only saw them on the way out about an hour later but Im sure theres no big ceremony involving a lot of guardsmen in colorful attires with some holding beautiful flags as at Gyeongbokgung since theres simply no space here for such a ceremony  Coming by subway City Hall Station Lines 1  2 is where to get off and youre pretty much right outside the Palace once you get out of the station onto the big street Sejong Daero just a 1to2minute walk to the entrance gate And what I suggest for the ticket is getting an integrated ticket for 10000 won the equivalent of 10 US dollars which is good for like a month and which gives you admission to four of Seouls five palaces except for Gyeonghuigung which Im sure is a small one maybe even smaller than this one  Jongmyo Shrine; also do keep in mind that this palace along with Changdeokgung  Changgyeonggung are closed on Mondays whereas the main palace Gyeongbokgung  Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays,81,much
82,19,440,I didnt expect much from this palace its small a third of its original size and gives an impression of a lessthankorean palace sibce there are modern buildings in it BUT It has difinitely exceeded my expectation Firstly it was considerably less crowded than Gyeongbukgung even in its peak time which is 11 am when the Changing of the Guard takes place Secondly the Changing of the guard is a wonderful experience you can follow the marching band around and watch the change comfortably and then even pause a few times to let you take photos with the guards Thirdly the history of the different buildings that compile the palace is very interesting One of the buildings is a fusion between traditional korean architecture and imperial architecture and to my opinion it was spectacular  For the meek price of 1000 won I recommend going I arrived around 920am so I even managed to get a free english tour with a guide before following the marching band  Overall I spent 3 hours exploring including the guard change and half a guided tour,82,much
83,20,451,You cant help but notice when visiting this ancient Palace that you are surrounded by modern day high rises in the heart of the city  This was a very popular Palace for school children to visit as there had to be several hundred children on site  The grounds are very nice and much bigger than expected There is a mixture of Western and Korean architecture Make sure to grab the brochure expaling everything at the entrance way  Definitely worth a look Very cheap to get in only 1000 won but free if you are 65 or older,83,much
84,21,458,This Palace one of four major Palaces in the same vicinity in Seoul is pretty much directly opposite City Hall and theres a metro station at City Hall so its easy to get to and find This is a smaller Palace than some of the others and has a few more laterbuilt buildings so is quite distinct from the other Palaces The Palace guards are interesting to see and photograph and you dont have to buy a ticket to go into the Palace to see them as for obvious reasons they are on the outside of the gate They are used to having their photos taken As a consequence you can also see much of the changing of the guards from the street too free of charge much like Buckingham Palace And the changing of the guards at Deoksugung and at Gyeongbokgung not far up the road for that matter has just as much pomp and ceremony with colourful uniforms and a marching band as Buckingham Palace or Horseguards Well worth a look if you can time it right,84,much
85,22,471,We choose to visit Deoksugung because of its size We would like to be able to tour the ground and thought that Gyeongbok and Changdeok is too much for our group of elderly and small children to walk through and cover all  We arrive exactly as the changing of the guard ceremony is about to start at 11 am and lucky enough to find a booth in front of the main gate that offer services of young korean student for a free tour to tourist They were official and looked very professional with their orange uniform and obviously they get the support from the local govt The purpose is to practise their english with foreigners and to learn more of their own culture which I thought were very nice  Sara our guide was only 14 years old about the same age as my eldest daughter thus they were instantly having a girl talk  she showed us around the palace complex stopped every now and then to explain about the buildings and their history  The complex also has a museum but we choose not to go in so cant comment on that one,85,much
86,23,474,located near the city hall good to walk around and see korean palace Convenient access but nothing much to do there,86,much
87,24,480,It might not be the most impressive of the palaces in Seoul but its still worth a visit and entry really doesnt cost much at all You probably dont need to spend much more than an hour there and definitely not more than two but the architecture alone is worth the price of admission even without taking into consideration the historical importance of the palace Signs are in English Korean Japanese and Chinese so almost any visitor can learn about the historical details,87,much
88,25,481,It was a very cold day  0 degrees so my walk around the grounds was brisk The entry fee is only 1000 won about 150 AUD so inexpensive  There are free tours leaving twice a day and there are brochures just inside the gates in English There are a number of plaques dotted about that have a short paragraph in English explaining the relevance which is very useful Overall it is a peaceful place that was largely empty in December and is was easy to stroll around and look at the gardens although they are pretty bare in winter  The grounds also house the Daehan Empire History museum which has tours of the 1st and second floors of the palace I peeked through the windows was worth a look if you like palaces and you can reserve your place in the free queue almost every hour  I didnt know this before I went so the tours were full Check it out before you go the rooms looked lovely In the ground level was a museum about the history of the dynasty Im not really sure there was an english brochure which didnt explain much and none of the displays had english translations so I am not sure what it was about Give it a miss if you are in a hurry although it is nice to get in outside from the cold  The changing of the guard was at 11am and I was able to see them marching from behind the hall all the way through the gardens to the outside gate Ignore the cheapskates who say to not pay go in and see it It was a good spectacle  Allow about an hour and there are plenty of toilets and drinking fountains throughout as well as a few vending machines if you want a quick drink or snack,88,much
89,26,489,Deoksugung 1000 for adults is one of the Five Grand Palaces of the Joseon Dynasty located next to Seoul Plaza and City Hall in the city centre Opening hours are 9am to 9pm closed Mondays  This palace served as the residence of the Royal family twice during late 16th century and then again at the turn of the 20th century providing well preserved buildings of traditional Korean and Western architecture  Here you will find a collection of traditional Korean style entrance gates lovely inner courtyards worship and residential halls pavilions and landscaping all quite similar to what you see at the much larger Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces You can also watch Changing of the Guards ceremonies here at Daehanmun Gate  Two unique inclusions at Deoksugung include the Western style buildings at Seogeodong Hall which was built in European style in 1910 and the adjacent building used to house the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art MMCA  Deoksugung branch  One of the things we very much enjoyed about visiting Deoksugung during the autumn was the fantastic fall foliage display seen throughout the palace grounds There were numerous spots where we found multiple colours of tree leaves that made for lovely photographs The autumn scene here was considerably more impressive here than at other palace grounds visited during this trip to Seoul  We were however disappointed to find the MMCA Deoksugung Art Museum closed during the time of our visit There was no indicated closing on the MMCA or Deoksugung websites nor at the place entrance which was odd  Overall we quite enjoyed spending time at the Deoksugung Palace Not only was it exceptionally beautiful this time of year but we found it more management a place to visit compared to larger palace grounds around Seoul You can comfortably browse Deoksugung in 3045 minutes or longer if you want to visit more leisurely This is a very good and cheap attraction visit to consider making during trips to Seoul,89,much
90,27,504,At the time of my visit the main hall was completely under wraps for renovation That said you may find \xe2\x80\x93 as I did \xe2\x80\x93 that this compound offers more of a cool leafy break from frantic downtown Seoul than a serious competitor to the other of Seouls palaces  It has very much of a parklike layout that seems to encourage relaxing and strolling The two main structures at the time I was there were the completely incongruous neo classical Museum of Modern Art and Royal Museum buildings \xe2\x80\x93 two structures which look like theyd be more at home in Washington DC than in Seoul  The entrance fee is very modest I believe 1000 Won so it is not a great financial investment to check it out particularly in the middle of a hot day I dont know if it is worth a special trip but if you have other sights nearby lined up then its logical to stop in,90,much
91,28,505,This is included if you get the combination Palace pass It is near City Hall It is very much like the other Palaces but very nice On reflection I would not get the combination pass as in my opinion you do not need to see them all as they are much the same,91,much
92,29,516,Unexpected quiet and serene palace beside a main 10 lane road The serenity was so relaxing The palace building were impressive However the best thing was the changing of the guard ceremony at 11am I did not know about it so was surprised when nearly run over by the parade Got a really good view and the ceremony had many parts Took about 25 minutes and was followed by a martial arts display There were a lot less tourists here so much more enjoyable,92,much
93,30,521,Gyeongbokgung Kyongbok may be the largest Joseon Choson dynasty palace in Seoul but Deoksugung Daekso Duksoo is perhaps the most charming The central palace itself is small and empty except for the throne in the middle of the throne room but the details on the roof are exquisite The small side buildings are also worth investigating including the bizarre hybrid turnofthecentury Russian gazebo behind the main palace building Make sure to check out the impressive Buddhist bells on the grounds of the palace The contrast with surrounding modern buildings is striking and makes for a good photo But the most impressive thing to see is actually the changing of the guard where sentinels in colorful Joseon dynasty costumes parade about in front of the entrance gate If you arrive 15 or 20 minutes before the changing of the guard go inside the palace grounds to see them marching out of the gate before beginning the ceremony After a short display of martial arts theres a moment when they allow tourists to have their pictures taken with the unsmiling guards; youll only have a few minutes so if youre interested be quick to take advantage of the opportunity Check in advance for the schedule for the changing of the guard Changdeokgung may have the Piwon Secret Garden  the single most interesting Joseon dynasty site in Seoul  but the grounds are enormous; Deoksugung is much more manageable and can easily be seen in an hour,93,much
94,31,522,I find that the most interesting thing about this palace compared to the others in Seoul is that shows the JoseonDaehan royal familys late attempts to Westernize which can be seen in the architecture Its a pity that so much of the palace was destroyed by the Japanese after King Gojong died The complex also contains one of the very few historic 2story buildings from old Korea Most buildings in traditional Korean architecture only had one floor,94,much
95,32,530,This palace is very small and not very interesting It consists of the entry gate a paved courtyard with a throne hall and another building in the traditional style There is also a tiny Europeanstyle garden and 2 large imposing neoclassical buildings built when Korea became an Empire at the end of the 19th century and opened up to the West One of these appeared to be an art museum with no identifiable entry from the palace grounds; the other Europeanstyle palace building was a mystery museum that was not mentioned in any guidebooks or the official Seoul Visitors Guide The sign in the front said a reservation was needed to see parts of the building but other parts could be seen without a reservation Upon entering this mystery building to visit the nonreservation parts I was ushered outside by the nonEnglish speaking staff before I could close the door behind me  clearly I was not welcome despite what was on the English signage The whole complex can probably be seen in 30mins or less The one redeeming feature of this otherwise boring place is the Changing of the Guard Ceremony This is the best show to see in Seoul and is very entertaining with a band martial arts display traditional dancing and military procedure It lasts close to 30 mins and is wellworth seeing The crowd control barriers are placed quite close to the ceremony so you get a much better view than at Gyeongbokgung,95,much
96,33,534,I have always wanted to see the inside of this palace Deoksugung was featured in the popular Korean drama called \xe2\x80\x9cGoong\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cPrincess Hours\xe2\x80\x9d but its so much more than that Built in the late 14th Century this palace still stands today as a reminder of Koreas rich cultural past For less than the price of using the buses in South Korea people get to walk through the royal palace grounds and see the throne room of the king The mighty throne with two golden dragons swirled in the roof over the throne gives the feeling of power and might During my time there there were two young men who performed with long sabers in an intricate dance of the ancient kings warriors If youre a nature lover the trees bushes and flowers are absolutely breathtaking I highly recommend entering the courtyard in the center and walking down the stone path to kings throne room for that is the very path that many a foreign dignitary had taken The King had a separate room for his queen servants children guests and guards so there are many rooms to look inside of The sparse furniture used back then allows the visitors to see the traditional ways of life for the King It truly is a must see while taking a tour of Seouls historical sights,96,much
97,34,535,Theres not much to really say about shrines and palaces but I think the Jongmyo Shrine and Deoksugung Palace is definitely worthy of your visit Youre literally walking in world history and its something that many of us young folks have taken for granted,97,much
98,35,539,We went in November and it was raining and cold We were fortunate to arrive just in time for the changing of the guards The experience was terrific and we took advantage of the photo op We happened to take a tour earlier and had learned a lot about the significance of the architecture which made this tour more interesting for us Theres not actually so much to see the buildings are sparsely decorated and you cannot go inside them but it is worth seeing nonetheless if for no other reason than to see the changing of the guard,98,much
99,36,542,The Palace itself is not that interesting buildings that are empty of fixtures and fittings inside not much to see but the park is nice and there is a small cafe overlooking a lake The changing of the guard is great  such colourful costumes music and deliberate ceremony we loved it Over 65s get in for free and low cost for others Worth turning up for the ceremony which takes place at the entrance to the palace so no need to go inside,99,much
100,37,547,Deoksugung Palace and gardens is a mustsee in the middle of Seoul  just across from the City Hall  Seoul Plaza The entrance is via the impressive Sumumjang gate where a changing of the guard ceremony is regularly held Entrance is cheap  free if you are 65 or over and have a passport or driving license They sell a handy little guide book which will fit in your pocket and costs just 500 Won Over the years much restoration work has been needed reflecting Koreas troubled past and rather inconvenient neighbours But the various structures are well worth looking at and on a fine day with the trees in blossom it is a magical place to stroll round,100,much
101,38,550,Well here is the main place in Seoul I recommend for a couple or family Here is much smaller than Gwanghwamun Gate near here Especially Seokjojeon Hall I love this place,101,much
102,39,556,This is a very nice park to sit and walk in and the added bonus are the palace buildings This part of Seoul has limited green space left over and it allows you even in the winter to sit in a bit of peace for as little as US 1  It has a number of nicer building to look at  one always wonders how much is really old and how much has been restored  And with respect to the ceremonial guards  checkout all the glued on moustaches and beards ;,102,much
103,40,557,Most hotels concierge will tell you theres nothing much to see here But this palace is quiet has a mix of architecture styles and is quite interesting Do not miss the changing of guards ceremony and check with hotel the timings especially during winter if too cold apparently there is no ceremony In the Seokjojeon hall theres an interesting guided tour foreigners follow the Korean group with audio guide about King Gojong and his son Sunjong the last monarch of Korea Sadly the Korean tour moves very quickly from room to room and those listening to audio guides are ushered out to another room before its finished The audio guide is very informative,103,much
104,41,578,This is the palace that you can and should see in the evening when the lights turn it into a kind of magic The best 1 admission ever And in a city where so much is rebuilt this has some original buildings,104,much
105,42,592,A beautiful place to sit back and relax but if you are after Temples and dont have much time in seoul I would not suggest this to be the best out of the lot  Its a nice place to have a cold drink and read a book this temple is included in the 5 palaces in one ticket,105,much
106,43,596,This is a very small property since much of the original Palace land has been sold off for development The buildings that still exist are nice and there is an english brochure available for 500 won Admission is only 1000 won for adults The whole thing can be seen in under an hour Inside the walls it is very peaceful you can bring a lunch and enjoy a nice meal on one of the benches,106,much
107,44,597,Following our visit to Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung we had some time to visit Deoksugung The history of this palace is covered extensively elsewhere and all the practical information required is in the excellent KTO page httpenglishvisitkoreaorkrenuSISI_EN_3_1_1_1jspcid264316  We bought an Integrated Ticket of Palaces which covers Changdeokgung Changgyeonggung Deoksugung Gyeongbokgung and Jongmyo Shrine This was excellent value at 10000 won  After the history lessons at the first two much larger palaces we did not join a tour as the palace is small enough to wander around independently with notes from your guidebook It is situated in delightful gardens with many seats dotted around so you can bring a picnic or rest your weary feet if you have been shopping too much in the nearby area  There is also a Changing of the Guards ceremony at this palace and the National Museum of Contemporary Art is in the same compound  Although this palace is not as big as Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung I gave it a five star rating because of its convenient location right in the centre of a shopping area which means you can just pop in for a quick visit and get some history and culture along with some art as well,107,much
108,45,601,Situated in the center of the city right at the subway exit Not a very big one which makes it a good choice when you dont have much time but still want to do some sightseeing Entrance is only 1 but theres additional charge for entering the museum located inside Pretty crowded among netizens during lunch time Make sure to check the schedule of changing guards ceremony outside the main gate,108,much
109,46,611,What a pleasant surprise tucked next to City Hall an elaborate and accessible Changing Of The Guards ceremony apparently running all the time; very inexpensive ticket price; immaculately restored and kept grounds and buildings all in a compact space Perfect for the tourist with limited time this gives a reasonable idea of the architecture and style of the glory days of Korea just as the Japanese were taking over There is a constant delicious juxtaposition of the spacious grounds surrounded by the totems of modern life shopping malls and skyscrapers Unlike the much bigger Gyeongbokgung palace where one may feel at times transported to the 17th century at the DeoksuGung you always see the context  the value Korea places on its history and its future both A further plus is the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art tucked in the back of the grounds like a forgotten relative Quite tame and not really very modern the museum is now showing Masterpieces of Modern Korean Painting an interesting set of tableaux clearly designed for a Koreanlanguage audience Still its worth a visit,109,much
110,47,617,Not the biggest palace but right in town and can done quickly if you dont have too much time try to assist to the guards shift change quite entertaining and explained in English,110,much
111,48,620,I enjoyed this Palace lots of history I arrived by subwayline 1 to City Hall the station stop was right at the entrance to the Palace Entrance fee was only KRW3000 which was well worth it there is so much to explore Be sure to check out the Changing of the Guard Ceremony which they do several times a day not to be missed there is also a very interesting Museum and a gift shop which offers some very colorful gifts After visiting Deoksugung check out Namdaemun Market which is a short walk away you will find anything here also a great place to grab a bite to eat,111,much
112,49,626,Deoksugung literally means the Palace of Virtue and Longevity in Korean or Chinese It is not well known that the Chinese was very much the official language in Korea although King Sejong created the Korean scripts in the late 15th century  I will mention the modern dimension first The place is near the City Hall One building houses the national museum of art which is not worthy its great name but holds special exhibitions I was impressed by a modern Korean painter who adopted Western techniques in his paintings Also Western style was introduced into the architecture and landscape in the compound  Without knowing the history one will not find the palace particularly interesting So let me add a historical flavor This place was used as royal places twice First was during the Korean resistance to the Japanese invasion at the end of the 16th century Since all others palaces were burned this place served as royal palace for a while It became a royal palace again after King Gojong ended his yearlong refuge in the Russian embassy in 1907 Gojong ascended the throne at the young age in 1863 and was under the influence or control of his father and later his wife He declared himself an emperor but was forced by Japanese to abdicate the throne to his son the last emperor His death and Wilsons 14 Points in January 1919 triggered the March First Movement which aimed at Korean independence,112,much
113,50,657,My wife and I visited Deoksugung Palace one icy cold afternoon It was in walking distance from our hotel in Myeongdong although I later learned that it was also just one station away The palace is probably the smallest or one of the smaller in Seoul but we found it romantic The grounds were very spacious and full of trees and the architecture was colourful as with other palaces Not much to see to be honest other than a few palace buildings and the changing of the guard ceremony But there is an museam inside the palace ground that provided interesting viewing and respite from the freezing cold There is also a lovely walk around the outer walls of the palace that we thoroughly enjoyed During that walk we had a fantastic lunch at the organic restaurant that is located at the theatre If you time your visit to the palace well you can follow it up with this walk late lunch at the restaurant and a theatre show So Deoksugung is okay on its own but great and conveniently fitted in as part of a walk of the area Do it,113,much
114,0,193, There was nothing special about Deoksugung Palace in winter but I went to Park Soogeun I see it all and go round and round but there is a mood just as written ,114,nothing
115,1,240, Deoksugung night tour is convenient and enjoyable The entrance is under construction and we recommend you to participate in the Seokjojeon event at night Even if there is nothing special it is nice to spend an ,115,nothing
116,2,474,located near the city hall good to walk around and see korean palace Convenient access but nothing much to do there,116,nothing
117,3,477,I got to witness the change of Guards and a terrific lady from HighSchool  who was volunteering to Guide Tourist around for free the entrence fees are nothing dont forget to bring your Hat and it takes more than one hour all rebuild after the fire  you need to learn about History there for sure,117,nothing
118,4,557,Most hotels concierge will tell you theres nothing much to see here But this palace is quiet has a mix of architecture styles and is quite interesting Do not miss the changing of guards ceremony and check with hotel the timings especially during winter if too cold apparently there is no ceremony In the Seokjojeon hall theres an interesting guided tour foreigners follow the Korean group with audio guide about King Gojong and his son Sunjong the last monarch of Korea Sadly the Korean tour moves very quickly from room to room and those listening to audio guides are ushered out to another room before its finished The audio guide is very informative,118,nothing
119,5,593,This is the only attraction that had an admission feebut there was little seemost of the buildings had been demolishedand those that remained had nothing in themthere was an art gallery which I was in and out of in 5 minutespoor reward for a long walk on a hot day,119,nothing
120,6,595,You will find almost nothing but empty palaces The pattern is nice but its can be seen in other places in Korea Ticket is cheap just 1000 KRW but really that cheap is not worth,120,nothing
121,7,614,The smallest of the 4 Seoul palaces on the UNESCO heritage list This buildings and surrounding park is nice for a walk But nothing terribly exciting about it although I enjoyed being there and seeing the architecture,121,nothing
