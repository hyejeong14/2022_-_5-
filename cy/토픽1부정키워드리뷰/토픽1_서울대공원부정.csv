3,2,281,"I visited the Gwacheon-located Seoul Grand Park and it was overall a positive experience. I only visited the zoo section, and not Seoul Land, the amusement park. For what it's worth my friends have told me that Seoul Land isn't really worth it, compared to Lotte World or Everland. The zoo features many animals, of all kinds and species and from all continents. There's pretty much everything you can think of : reptiles, big mammals, seals, éléphants, lions... The park is also perfectly located in between mountains and offers a stunning view. It also has a fairly large choice of dining and snack options. My bigger complaint with the park is that it feels a bit run down. Enclosures are fairly stale, and a some animals seemed a bit unhealthy. It also lacks some kind of a theme (safari, themes for different clades or cintinents), special events allowing greater interaction with animals or staff, as well as a session dedicated to children for example)",3,staff
4,3,294,"This place was amazing and so big we couldn't even do it all before we got tired and a little too hot for the day. There are many animals and they have nicely done enclosures. The guide map was in English but we found very few of the staff spoke English. However this wasn't too important as we wanted to just see the animals. They had an amazing dolphin and seal lion show that was included with the entrance fee. There was an impressive green house with many many different species of lovely plants. We also took the sky lift to get a birds eye view (and return to the front) and it wasn't very expensive. The zoo is non-smoking which was nice. There were several food options and one had a lot of good Korean food options with a serve yourself kimchi bar. There were colored lines along paths if you wanted to do a particular loop with each taking about two hours to complete. We didn't use these, but it was a nice option. Overall this zoo was enormous and very nicely done. We were glad we were able to visit and little sad we didn't get to see the whole place (or have time to to return again on another day).",4,staff
5,4,306,"We are a family of four, we have a 9 year old daughter and a 3 year old son. We went to Seoul Grand Park on Sep 1 2013 and loved it. I would highly recommend taking the subway, line #4, stop SEOUL GRAND PARK. If you exit out of exit 2, you will walk about 1/4 mile to the SGP tram loading/unloading zone. I would recommend paying to ride the tram as the entrance to the zoo is about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile uphill (and trust me you are going to be walking uphill enough). The tram cost us 2,700 won. Although the tram area looks busy as all get out, trams came one right after another, only waiting about 30 seconds between trams. They moved us out like cattle! We were pleased with the tram. So, once the tram stopped, we bought our tickets to the zoo (they included a special ""theme"" ticket allowing us into another attraction, I am all but certain it was the rose garden, but we never made it), and we entered the zoo (9,600 won total, I could NOT believe how inexpensive it was). Ok, once in the zoo, either take the ski lift all the way up to the top and walk down and call it a day, or find a good spot to tighten your walking shoes. The walk to the top is uphill, you will earn your view of the lions and the other ""cats"", but it is well worth it. I've never been to a zoo that had over 6 lions, not lioness, lions! This zoo has it ALL, from Bison, Bears (so many), Dolphins to Deer. The highlight of the day was the deer eating out of my daughter and son's hand (although it's probably not recommended by the staff, if you have little ones than bring lettuce or carrots, my kids just fed them the green leaves they found on the ground and they ate them). We had absolutely no complaints about this zoo, in fact it blew away our expectations. Bathrooms extremely clean, convenient stores selling soda and snacks for regular prices (not jacked up because it's in a zoo, a soda was 900 won), and such a wide variety of animals. Tip #1 - allow a FULL day here. So, the end of the day we hopped back on the tram and we thought it would take us straight to the loading/unloading area we boarded the tram when we arrived....no. It made one stop at Seoul Land prior to heading back. Tip #2 - there is MORE at the Seoul Grand Park than the zoo!!! Who knew right?? Well, we do and we are definitely heading back soon! We had an incredible day!",5,staff

There are some food stalls in the way. It's fun to watch and I recommend having foods here because foods inside the park are much more expensive.  Zoo: - We bought combined ticket of 10,500 won for a lift, a elephant bus and an entrance. After buying the ticket, go to the lift station on the right and take the lift until the highest area of the zoo. Walk around the zoo and take the bus when it's done. This seems to be the best way to save money.  - The zoo was fine. Food stands, bathrooms, benches are everywhere. Bird Zone is like a Jurassic Park. If you are lucky, you'll be able to see parrots very closely. We were very amused to see apes. I think Ape Zone is the best part in this zoo.  - I was a bit disappointed not to see lions. There were MANY constructions and some animals aren't staying at where they are supposed to be. Bat cages were empty.  - It's a lot of walking anyway. Be ready to get tired.  - There's A-Zoo tour on the website to travel comfortably riding on a cart for children or seniors. It's not available at the ticket office. I think they should fix that.  - Even though there are animals of many kinds, there are still many this zoo doesn't have. So, don't expect to see every one you can imagine.  - There's an arboretum in the zoo. It was just okay level.  - There are a number of visitors in the zoo. But, this is a huge zoo and there's no chance to wait to see something. We liked it.  - Some of them close at 18:00. You'd better enter before that if you wish to see everything.",8,empty

13,2,230,"We drove. Traffic was pretty backed up getting to and from the parking lot and Waze was directing us away from the parking we needed, beyond the ""Seoul Zoo"" parking sign, so we ignored Waze. We were able to pay for parking using our debit card, didn't need a Korean bank card or won. 5,000 won for a smaller vehicle and 10,000 won for a larger. From the parking lot, follow the crowds to get tickets for the Elephant Tram or walk 1km to the main entrance of the zoo. At the zoo entrance, buy tickets to enter the zoo. There are stroller rentals available, we were also able to use our debit card for this. 3,000 won, but had to leave ID there until we returned. Strollers were nice. The zoo grounds are beautiful. It was hot out, but I bet a trip in the fall would have been perfect. I was expecting to see a lot of sad exhibits based on other comments, but they seemed pretty typical compared to any other zoo I've been to. I thought the spacing was good and yes, there's a lot of walking, but it didn't feel like too much. My kids had a lot of fun. I thought the food/drink choices were good, too. You can also bring your own food and drink in if you wanted. When leaving, you have to buy a return trip for the Elephant Tram or make the 1 km trek back to the parking area (which is also the same as the entrance to the subway)... I recommend going, especially if you have kids! It was fun!",13,small
14,3,233,"I love visiting zoo’s and seeing different animals. However, I recommend not visiting this zoo. I travelled 1.5 hours to get here, and I feel like my time travelling and visiting was wasted. There were many different animals, which was probably the best point. Each enclosure was small, dirty, and there was no sign of a zookeeper anywhere. Usually on my visits to the zoo I see many zookeepers tending and feeding the animals, but during my visit here I didn’t see any. Many animals looked sad and hungry, often eating dry leaves. The monkeys were also acting out at each other, probably because the cages were so small. As I mentioned, I love to visit the zoo, just not this one.",14,small

18,7,266,"The zoo is a part of Seoul Grand Park outside Seoul Grand Park station line 4.On weekends, take the subway...it's not worth all the traffic driving there.As you exit the station there is a long walk to the grand park main entrance. There will be some (imo) offputting smells, mostly form the boiling bundegi (silkworm pupae) Theres even a KFC and a convenience store...recommend you get some water as the zoo is big. You can get water and ddrinks inside as well. At the entrance of the park you can walk further to the zoo but that isn't recommended. Go to the booth and pay 1000won for a ride on the elephant tram. The tram hits all the sites at the park and drops you off infront of the zoo. You can also ride the skylift for about 5000won. The zoo is big. Frankly too big. What I mean is there are many of the different animal pavilions are separated by long stretches of trees and grass. So you're walking uphill a lot and seeing nothing for that time. It's nice if that's what you want to see but it seemed like a lot of wasted space. Some(many) of the animal pens were rather small. The monkey and ape sections were tiny. The park is relatively clean and there are plenty of food stall along the different paths. Unfortunately they all sell the same things like sausage, ""corndogs"", and fishcakes-on a stick. And coffee. Bad tasting coffee. The ""meats"" on sticks were pretty bad. Don't use the bathrooms here. Use at the subway or, if you have the time, go to the museum across the road...wonderfully clean there. You can take the skylift from the rear of the zoo and save yourself the walk. It's fun and you get a really wonderful view. Expect long lines when people are starting to leave. FYI, be aware of your clothes on the skylift. Adjust miniskirts when you sit. If this is your first trip to Korea you'll see people all over the place camped out on blankets and mats. They're not homeless. Don't give them change.

Some very nice pavilions (especially the tiger part), but also unfortunately some very small cages for certain animals. End of March is still a bit cold and some animals were thus still kept inside (which is good for them, no complaints on that as an animal lover), and the grass and flowers still have to set in. I certainly recommend the place, it's a must visit, but would advice to go mid April or later. Also very cheap (3000 WON for an adult)",19,small
20,9,280,"Recently I conducted a photo workshop focused on photographing wild animals. Rather than trying to stalk and photograph the critters, we ramped up our odds of finding subjecs by heading off to the Seoul Zoo. Yeah, a zoo - a place that I had thought to be a rather lame place to take photos.  Well, I was wrong in so many ways. First, the Seoul Zoo is no longer that third class park with dingy animal exhibits and less than optimally cared for animals. The place is simply amazing. It's huge, clean, beautiful and a real joy to be during a fine spring day. The exhibits include many walk-ins, including a massive enclosure of cranes, storks and other waterfowl where the public can see birds wading, swimming and flying without any barriers other than a hand rail. There are other walk-ins for tropical birds where the birds literally flutter around you. And the tiger exhibit is really exceptional - but naturally not a walk-in exhibit!  Second, it's a great place to take photographs. Sometimes it's almost as easy as shooting fish in a barrel; but other times, such as trying to catch cranes in mid flight, one can appreciate what goes into quality wildlife photography in the field. Also, there were many young couples courting there with their ubiquitous selfie-sticks. Naturally, the place had more than its fair share of kids, but because the place is truly spacious, they were not underfoot as they could have easily been in a smaller park.  It's been decades since I've had such a good time at a zoo. The last time was the San Diego Zoo. The Seoul Zoo is not (yet) on the same level as the San Diego Zoo, but it is coming up close to that level. For W3,000 admission, the Seoul Zoo has to be one of the hidden gems of Korea.  Seoul Zoo at Seoul Grand Park is located in Gyeonggi-do, just south of Seoul. The Seoul Zoo is 1.5 km walk (or tram ride) from the subway station. There is also a 1 Km lift available about 0.5 km from exit 2 of the subway.  Opening Hours: 09:00 am ~ 19:00 pm (depending on season, some walk-in exhibits close at 5 pm)  Admission: Adult (19+): 3,000 won Youth (13 – 18): 2,000 won Child (6 – 12): 1,000 won. Under 6 is free. Botanical Gardens and Dolphin show cost extra.  How to get to Seoul Zoo: Take line 4 to Seoul Grand Park station and leave exit 2.

21,10,289,"Perhaps I am just spoiled having recently visited a few zoological facilities in the United States and being from Columbus, Ohio where noted animal expert, Jack Hannah was the Zoo Director for many years and remains Director Emeritus. The things that I really liked about the Seoul Grand Park Zoo is it's ease of access. It is very easy to find and very easy to get to. That says a lot for a Korean city like Gwacheon, which is part of metropolitan Seoul. The grounds of Seoul Grand Park are expansive. It is a great place just to go and hike and you can see many locals who go there to do just that. The walk-ways double as access roads for shuttle busses and service vehicles, so they are very wide. The park is full of beautiful sprawling hardwoods and little island of green grass where you can sit and relax. Many have Korean-style wooden decks that are covered with aesthetic local-flavored covering and there are some places that are African themed with covered pavilions suitable for groups to relax. Seoul Grand Park is not ALL Zoo, but it has many different parts to it. At the parking lot you can find wide walking avenues lined with trees leading to the entrance to the general park. There are adequate western-style restroom facilities throughout the park. You have the option of taking a lift into the park or taking the ""Elephant Train"" which is just a Tow vehicle pulling several passenger platforms. Hold on to your children though--the driver only has two speeds, stop and escape velocity. The Elephant Train costs about 600 won each time you use it and it only takes you to the entrance of the Zoo and the other parks. I think there were three or four stops in all. Once at the entrance of the Zoo, the admission for adults is 3,000 won. They will only give you one ticket for your entire party and it will have the number of people on the ticket, so don't get separated before you go through the Zoo entrance. All that being said, once inside the zoo I was really disappointed at the obvious wear on the infrastructure. Everywhere you looked facilities cried out for a coat of paint and rust treatment. We came upon so many of the different ""herd"" animals and they were in vast outdoor enclosures. That's great for the animals I think, but they were so far away most of the time that you couldn't really observe them. Fortunately the park is loaded with casted replicas of the animals. It presents a lot of photo opportunities for the kids I guess. One of the things we really wanted to see was the Dolphin Show advertised on the English Web Page for the Seoul Grand Park Zoo. When we finally found the Marine Pavilion, the ticket windows had shutters pulled down inside. There were no signs showing the performance schedule or the admission price for the Dolphin show and we couldn't fined anyone around to ask. There were several marine habitats built around the perimeter of the Marine Pavilion, but they were not well kept. The water was dirty with a dark green tint and the walls of the habitat had not been repainted in years and there was a lot of places where paint had either worn away over years of neglect or chipped off the surface. I wouldn't be surprised if the Marine mammals had died over the years because of the poor conditions. After all, there was only one or two of each of the varieties of sea lions per habitat and they didn't seem too healthy. They rarely came out of the water and because it was so dirty it was nearly impossible to see them. I later asked an information attendant about the Dolphin show and she told me they hadn't had a Dolphin show in over two years despite being advertised on the English Web Page. From the looks of the outside of the Marine Pavilion I'd bet they are hoping to eliminate the marine exhibits by attrition as the animals die off. No I can't verify that, but the generally lacking upkeep of the Marine Pavilion and surrounding marine habitats, the lack of performances, and failure to care for the animals by just cleaning the scum out of the habitats or changing the water is highly suspect. I will give high marks to the Mountain Goat exhibit area. They have a manufactured rock cliff mountain that is really high and there was a huge herd of goats spread out on practically every available ledge and plateau and they were actively climbing up and down, passing each other on narrow pathways of rock--all looking quite natural. It was awesome to see how sure-footed they were and I felt this exhibit really captured the essence of the animals. The Giraffe habitat was also well done. There were three out in the open when I was there and they have a second-story platform where you can look at the eye-to-eye if they ever come that close. I really enjoyed the Meerkats too. There were only three in the exhibit, but it looked somewhat small. The interesting thing is that the pen was relatively small and they were only separated from patrons by a short Plexiglas wall. It would be easy for unsupervised children to feed them junk. I did notice that one child was eating something while I was there and one of the little Meerkats scurried over beside him and stood up just inside the Plexiglas waiting to see if there was anything edible coming his way. But it was fun to be able to see these little guys up close. They are adorable! The brochure that you get when you enter the Zoo says there are shuttle busses running around the park that will take you between venues or to the exit, but we were at all of the venues listed as stops in the brochure and we never saw a bus run. When I asked the information attendant as I was leaving she said the busses were running earlier in the day, but we were there for about 4 hours and never saw the bus once. If you want to go get some good exercise and be bathed by the sprawling hardwoods as you hike the hills throughout the Zoo and surrounding hills, this is a great place to go. After all, it costs only 3,000 won to enter. Perhaps that is the difference between the cleanliness and better upkeep in the Zoos I have visited in the United States--all of them have a much higher entrance fee. You'd pay $3 dollars or more for just a bottle of water in a US Zoo too, but here at Seoul Grand Park bottled water is only 1,000 won and they have free water fountains, food and souvenir/toy shops throughout the park. They have stroller rentals available as you enter the Zoo and there are also some coin-operated lockers available and I think they cost 500 won.",21,small
22,11,291,"I am big fan of ZOO's in general and I was looking forward to see this ZOO. You have direct subway line to get there. ZOO was really cheap, like 3USD to enter for whole day. A lot of animals to look at. I loved it.  But, there is one point to mention: I do have worries about taking care of the animals there. You can see that animals are not in the best shape and not happy as well... Especially the cage for jaguars is very(!) small... So this fact was a dark side of my visit :(  But ZOO is in the beautiful environment, so you really feel escaped from the city.",22,small
23,12,307,"Before I review the zoo at Seoul Grand Park, I must state it is always my preference to view wildlife in their natural habitat. It is a much more thrilling and worthwhile experience.  As far as zoo's go, Seoul Grand Park offers a variety of animals, with accurate information on the different species. All zoo exhibits are far too small for wild animals. But we should make it clear in modern-day zoos most animals are now bread in captivity or incapable of returning to the wild for a multitude of reasons. Zoo's today are primarily for education, not exhibiting ferocious, exotic, or bizarre animals just for the wow factor. Zoo management can always work to improve the conditions and how animals are ""shown"" to the public. I am therefore judging Seoul's premier zoo in comparison to others around the world. The zoo is comparable to many in the US, but certainly a peg below the San Diego Zoo in both diversity in species and exhibit quality. Seoul Grand Park is far better than any zoo in China (that I've seen), even with the exclusion of the much loved panda. The exhibits are cleaner, more spacious, and the signboards provide far more information than other zoo's I've visited in Asia (and some in the US).  I enjoyed my time here, the exhibits were often interesting. But like most zoos there were individual exhibits that just needed to be larger and better kept. This is by no means unique to Seoul Grand Park, even in the San Diego Zoo there are old exhibits that need renovation/expansion.",23,small

Many have Korean-style wooden decks that are covered with aesthetic local-flavored covering and there are some places that are African themed with covered pavilions suitable for groups to relax. Seoul Grand Park is not ALL Zoo, but it has many different parts to it. At the parking lot you can find wide walking avenues lined with trees leading to the entrance to the general park. There are adequate western-style restroom facilities throughout the park. You have the option of taking a lift into the park or taking the ""Elephant Train"" which is just a Tow vehicle pulling several passenger platforms. Hold on to your children though--the driver only has two speeds, stop and escape velocity. The Elephant Train costs about 600 won each time you use it and it only takes you to the entrance of the Zoo and the other parks. I think there were three or four stops in all. Once at the entrance of the Zoo, the admission for adults is 3,000 won. They will only give you one ticket for your entire party and it will have the number of people on the ticket, so don't get separated before you go through the Zoo entrance. All that being said, once inside the zoo I was really disappointed at the obvious wear on the infrastructure. Everywhere you looked facilities cried out for a coat of paint and rust treatment. We came upon so many of the different ""herd"" animals and they were in vast outdoor enclosures. That's great for the animals I think, but they were so far away most of the time that you couldn't really observe them. Fortunately the park is loaded with casted replicas of the animals. It presents a lot of photo opportunities for the kids I guess. One of the things we really wanted to see was the Dolphin Show advertised on the English Web Page for the Seoul Grand Park Zoo. When we finally found the Marine Pavilion, the ticket windows had shutters pulled down inside. There were no signs showing the performance schedule or the admission price for the Dolphin show and we couldn't fined anyone around to ask. There were several marine habitats built around the perimeter of the Marine Pavilion, but they were not well kept. The water was dirty with a dark green tint and the walls of the habitat had not been repainted in years and there was a lot of places where paint had either worn away over years of neglect or chipped off the surface. I wouldn't be surprised if the Marine mammals had died over the years because of the poor conditions. After all, there was only one or two of each of the varieties of sea lions per habitat and they didn't seem too healthy. They rarely came out of the water and because it was so dirty it was nearly impossible to see them. I later asked an information attendant about the Dolphin show and she told me they hadn't had a Dolphin show in over two years despite being advertised on the English Web Page. From the looks of the outside of the Marine Pavilion I'd bet they are hoping to eliminate the marine exhibits by attrition as the animals die off. No I can't verify that, but the generally lacking upkeep of the Marine Pavilion and surrounding marine habitats, the lack of performances, and failure to care for the animals by just cleaning the scum out of the habitats or changing the water is highly suspect. I will give high marks to the Mountain Goat exhibit area. They have a manufactured rock cliff mountain that is really high and there was a huge herd of goats spread out on practically every available ledge and plateau and they were actively climbing up and down, passing each other on narrow pathways of rock--all looking quite natural. It was awesome to see how sure-footed they were and I felt this exhibit really captured the essence of the animals. The Giraffe habitat was also well done. There were three out in the open when I was there and they have a second-story platform where you can look at the eye-to-eye if they ever come that close. I really enjoyed the Meerkats too. There were only three in the exhibit, but it looked somewhat small. The interesting thing is that the pen was relatively small and they were only separated from patrons by a short Plexiglas wall. It would be easy for unsupervised children to feed them junk. I did notice that one child was eating something while I was there and one of the little Meerkats scurried over beside him and stood up just inside the Plexiglas waiting to see if there was anything edible coming his way. But it was fun to be able to see these little guys up close. They are adorable! The brochure that you get when you enter the Zoo says there are shuttle busses running around the park that will take you between venues or to the exit, but we were at all of the venues listed as stops in the brochure and we never saw a bus run. When I asked the information attendant as I was leaving she said the busses were running earlier in the day, but we were there for about 4 hours and never saw the bus once. If you want to go get some good exercise and be bathed by the sprawling hardwoods as you hike the hills throughout the Zoo and surrounding hills, this is a great place to go. After all, it costs only 3,000 won to enter. Perhaps that is the difference between the cleanliness and better upkeep in the Zoos I have visited in the United States--all of them have a much higher entrance fee. You'd pay $3 dollars or more for just a bottle of water in a US Zoo too, but here at Seoul Grand Park bottled water is only 1,000 won and they have free water fountains, food and souvenir/toy shops throughout the park. They have stroller rentals available as you enter the Zoo and there are also some coin-operated lockers available and I think they cost 500 won.",30,disappointed

The weather was very nice, sunny and cool, no icy floor, the cherry blossoms were still in effect so lots of people were still taking pictures, all the animals were out and about instead of locked in large rooms.  Kids get in free so when we went there was many school children which was very nice to see them enjoy the park.",42,old

Once you get of the elephant train, you have to pay again to get back on it lol  The actual zoo is very large but due to winter most of the animals are kept inside, you can still see them but it would be better if you visit the Zoo after spring. The paths are slippery with ice so be careful.  Next to the zoo is Seoul Land an amusement park, it was too cold to go there so didnt bother.",44,old
45,14,252,"We visited this Park in the night after 7pm, having taken around 50-min subway ride from central Seoul. The subway station nearest to the Park is named after the Grand Park itself.  We were there primarily to see the cherry blossoms. There were of course much fewer cherry blossom trees compared to Yeouido or Seokchon Lake, nevertheless, this Park is much more spacious and bigger and with fewer people as compared to the ever crowded Yeouido or Seokchon Lake.  The cherry blossom trees are to the left of the entrance to the Park. It was still a nice sight to behold even in the night, due to the brightly lit night lights. For the cherry blossom season especially, there was some nice, romantic decorations and also a row of 5-6 pianos freely available for visitors to play a nice melody to accompany the romantic ambience of the place. Could see many couples and families with children being enthralled by the place, taking we-fies and photos.  Overall, a nice place to visit in the evenings, after the main crowd visiting the zoo and other themed-attractions have left.",45,old

It was like painting. قضيت وقت ممتع هناك وكان أجمل يوم قضيته في كوريا الجنوبية. ذهبت لهناك يومين متتاليين لشدة جمال المكان. انصح به بشدة لمحبي الحيوانات. المكان جيد للأزواج للأصدقاء والعوائل. انصح بزيارته عندما يكون الجو ربيعي. ليس حارا جدا ولا باردا جدا. المنظر عندما ارتفعنا على الكرسي المعلق كان أخاذاً.. كان وكأنه لوحة مرسومة وليس حقيقة.",46,old

48,17,264,"We went there in August and it's too hot for us. We could only walked for half an hour and decided to leave. The zoo is pretty old. The staff is not good at providing information (as we walk along the way to the zoo from cable car station, we just realized that there a shuttle bus to the zoo but the woman at the information didnt tell us. So we have to walk under really hot weather).",48,old
49,18,269,"Very nice and big zoo, we were there for 5 hours and did not get to see everything. Even though it was quite busy on a Sunday, the park is big enough to not feel trapped in the masses. Some very nice pavilions (especially the tiger part), but also unfortunately some very small cages for certain animals. End of March is still a bit cold and some animals were thus still kept inside (which is good for them, no complaints on that as an animal lover), and the grass and flowers still have to set in. I certainly recommend the place, it's a must visit, but would advice to go mid April or later. Also very cheap (3000 WON for an adult)",49,old
50,19,277,"1. Very approachable, directly connected with subway, then short elephant or skyline journey to enter in. With 1 year old we preferred train. However the skyline are quite safe with netting beneath the path all the way so we returned through skyline. It is around 30 min with two changing stations. The mountainous surrounding are worth watch. A lovely sightseeing if that is your interest.  2. Very neat and organised. Follow orange, yellow, blue, brown line to have one particular tour like deer park, birds, African safari. dolphin route etc. We did dolphin and birds. Because the bird one is mostly within building with cooling that kept my baby comfortable. Dolphin show and seal show were 10 min or so. No extra payment.  3. Food outlets, toilets, nursing rooms are available all over for very cheap. Just carry picnic mat and buy food from there. They have burger king, cafe tiamo, c4u, Korean food restaurant and street food for cheap.  4. Hiring stroller is excellent idea. The stroller is very comfortable with enough room and shade. Do not carry your bulky ones. 2000 won for it whole day.  5. Forest bathing needs trekking and time. We skipped it for next visit.  6. Definitely one visit is not enough, too much walking, too much to see. If your kids are zoo lovers or you are bird watcher it is very very worth.  7. One day trip for 2 adults and a baby was covered in less than 40 000 won. This makes it all the more awesome. I am sure for a second visit. And, oh. ...It is ranked in top five zoo in the world 😊",50,old
51,20,281,"I visited the Gwacheon-located Seoul Grand Park and it was overall a positive experience. I only visited the zoo section, and not Seoul Land, the amusement park. For what it's worth my friends have told me that Seoul Land isn't really worth it, compared to Lotte World or Everland. The zoo features many animals, of all kinds and species and from all continents. There's pretty much everything you can think of : reptiles, big mammals, seals, éléphants, lions... The park is also perfectly located in between mountains and offers a stunning view. It also has a fairly large choice of dining and snack options. My bigger complaint with the park is that it feels a bit run down. Enclosures are fairly stale, and a some animals seemed a bit unhealthy. It also lacks some kind of a theme (safari, themes for different clades or cintinents), special events allowing greater interaction with animals or staff, as well as a session dedicated to children for example)",51,old
52,21,289,"Perhaps I am just spoiled having recently visited a few zoological facilities in the United States and being from Columbus, Ohio where noted animal expert, Jack Hannah was the Zoo Director for many years and remains Director Emeritus. The things that I really liked about the Seoul Grand Park Zoo is it's ease of access. It is very easy to find and very easy to get to. That says a lot for a Korean city like Gwacheon, which is part of metropolitan Seoul. The grounds of Seoul Grand Park are expansive.

53,22,292,"I like to visit zoos whenever I go on holidays. It rained a bit on the day of my visit though.  The zoo is actually within a huge park. To go around the zoo itself is similar to going on a nature walk due to its size. Some of the buildings were a bit old and run down though. The bird exhibits were all closed off to visitors although the birds were there (couldn't read the Korean signs saying why). Tiger exhibit was being renovated in new area. Other animals seemed to be relatively ""happy"" (compared to the animals in Tokyo Ueno Zoo which seem to have gone neurotic, i.e. walking in circles etc.)  Was very quite when I went, which was good.",53,old

56,25,306,"We are a family of four, we have a 9 year old daughter and a 3 year old son. We went to Seoul Grand Park on Sep 1 2013 and loved it. I would highly recommend taking the subway, line #4, stop SEOUL GRAND PARK. If you exit out of exit 2, you will walk about 1/4 mile to the SGP tram loading/unloading zone. I would recommend paying to ride the tram as the entrance to the zoo is about 1/2 to 3/4 of a mile uphill (and trust me you are going to be walking uphill enough). The tram cost us 2,700 won. Although the tram area looks busy as all get out, trams came one right after another, only waiting about 30 seconds between trams. They moved us out like cattle! We were pleased with the tram. So, once the tram stopped, we bought our tickets to the zoo (they included a special ""theme"" ticket allowing us into another attraction, I am all but certain it was the rose garden, but we never made it), and we entered the zoo (9,600 won total, I could NOT believe how inexpensive it was). Ok, once in the zoo, either take the ski lift all the way up to the top and walk down and call it a day, or find a good spot to tighten your walking shoes. The walk to the top is uphill, you will earn your view of the lions and the other ""cats"", but it is well worth it. I've never been to a zoo that had over 6 lions, not lioness, lions! This zoo has it ALL, from Bison, Bears (so many), Dolphins to Deer. The highlight of the day was the deer eating out of my daughter and son's hand (although it's probably not recommended by the staff, if you have little ones than bring lettuce or carrots, my kids just fed them the green leaves they found on the ground and they ate them). We had absolutely no complaints about this zoo, in fact it blew away our expectations. Bathrooms extremely clean, convenient stores selling soda and snacks for regular prices (not jacked up because it's in a zoo, a soda was 900 won), and such a wide variety of animals. Tip #1 - allow a FULL day here. So, the end of the day we hopped back on the tram and we thought it would take us straight to the loading/unloading area we boarded the tram when we arrived....no. It made one stop at Seoul Land prior to heading back. Tip #2 - there is MORE at the Seoul Grand Park than the zoo!!! Who knew right?? Well, we do and we are definitely heading back soon! We had an incredible day!",56,old
57,26,307,"Before I review the zoo at Seoul Grand Park, I must state it is always my preference to view wildlife in their natural habitat. It is a much more thrilling and worthwhile experience.  As far as zoo's go, Seoul Grand Park offers a variety of animals, with accurate information on the different species. All zoo exhibits are far too small for wild animals. But we should make it clear in modern-day zoos most animals are now bread in captivity or incapable of returning to the wild for a multitude of reasons. Zoo's today are primarily for education, not exhibiting ferocious, exotic, or bizarre animals just for the wow factor. Zoo management can always work to improve the conditions and how animals are ""shown"" to the public. I am therefore judging Seoul's premier zoo in comparison to others around the world. The zoo is comparable to many in the US, but certainly a peg below the San Diego Zoo in both diversity in species and exhibit quality. Seoul Grand Park is far better than any zoo in China (that I've seen), even with the exclusion of the much loved panda. The exhibits are cleaner, more spacious, and the signboards provide far more information than other zoo's I've visited in Asia (and some in the US).  I enjoyed my time here, the exhibits were often interesting. But like most zoos there were individual exhibits that just needed to be larger and better kept. This is by no means unique to Seoul Grand Park, even in the San Diego Zoo there are old exhibits that need renovation/expansion.",57,old
58,27,313,"Guess choosing to go in winter was both a good and bad idea.  The brutal cold was not forgiving, but the view was worth every shiver and frostbite I suffered. The zoo being surrounded by mountains, which made the view amazingly beautiful and the streams within made the view even prettier. There was buses to bring visitors around the zoo, which was fairly big, but it is definitely a good workout.  The zoo was not catered for visiting in the winter as most of the enclosures were closed, and animals being put indoors, where it was heated. The conditions of the indoor enclosures was pretty bad and the smell was pungent and took getting used to.  What I loved most though, was the baby animals section where we got to see various animals up close just separated by a glass panel. Seeing the baby leopard up close was amazing .  Would return again to have a look at the animals in their natural enclosure if I ever go again in spring or autumn. Mainly because of the affordable admission and the wide variety of animals we can see. But this time, I would take the free shuttle and not walk the whole area. =P",58,old
