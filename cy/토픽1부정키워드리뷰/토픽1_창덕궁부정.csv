1,1,20,A cultural landmark that needs to be visited when in Seoul I havent been to any of the other royal palaces in Seoul so I cant compare but we thought this place was great and not crowded we visited a weekday in May Ive been here before and then it was much more crowded but even then it felt like there were plenty of space for everyone You should probably combine this with the Secret Garden but unfortunately we didnt have the time I recommend this place,1,much
2,2,30,A wonderful palace to visit when you come to Seoul It is a lot less busy than Gyeongbokgung Palace which makes your visit to it seem a lot more personal and intimate Whilst here you can marvel at the architecture of the palace and its surrounding buildings or take a stroll through the many gardens and paths or relax at the lake There is so much to do in this place and I recommend you spend a minimum 2 hours here to fully appreciate it Would love to come back here,2,much
3,3,57,It was a really nice afternoon sadly the secret garden was closed apparently you had to prebook tickets which we were unaware of the sign said for covid but I met a person the next day who said she went the same day and possibly time as us so prebook those tickets if you want to see the gardens For the rest of it I thought is was much more beautiful than Gyeongbokgun Palace but it did seem a bit smaller Well worth the visit if youre in Seoul,3,much
4,4,90,"Stunning palace. I have a lot of time in Seoul and Korea so going to see all the palaces. If your time is limited, definitely do this one. Time your visit accordingly with the mandatory guided tour of the Secret Garden. Annoyingly they appear to change timings so check online the day before your visit. I got there at 09:00 when they opened. I was the first person inside. I walked around the palace grounds myself for just over an hour and then did the English guided Secret Garden tour at 10:30 which finished around noon. Lasts about one and a half hours. You can leave the tour after fifty minutes as the last part is quite a bit of walking including uphill. For most of us it is fine but others were struggling with the heat even though it was early and parts of it are uphill so be mindful. I spent in total three hours there. Separate ticket for the palace and Secret Garden. They do have guided tours of the palace itself but to be honest, you can easily do this yourself. They give you a booklet plus there are information boards. Suggest going early as soon as it opens. It was beautiful and peaceful and you could freely walk around and enjoy the setting, also getting some good photographs. When I left at noon, it was much busier. Grounds are clean and well laid out. The palace was stunning. I loved the details of the doors and the architecture. There is a cafe and what appeared to be an art or souvenir shop on the premises. I didn't bother with it. Take water with especially if you are there for three hours like me. There are restrooms too. My thoughts. The Secret Garden is apparently the highlight. Whilst this was nice, I think the weather will contribute towards your experience. We had a lovely day and the sun shining with the reflection on the water and the colours of the leaves made the gardens look very pretty. However, we can't control the weather and I would suggest thinking about this if you have a day with bad weather. Parts of the garden were nice but other parts started to look the same. I started to get bored as did a lot of the group. I was glad I went though. The guide was difficult to understand (although the tour was in English) but there are information boards as well along the route which also provide useful facts. They limit the number of people on the tour so purchase a ticket as soon as you arrive.",4,much

6,6,108,"Set within a large park, accessible by subway, bus or tour, this Prospering Virtue Palace was built during the Joseon Dynasty. It served as the main palace for nearly 270 years following its destruction during the Japanese invasion and its subsequent rebuilding. A visitor may note that one building in particular, the Seonjeongjeon Hall is the only building featuring a tiled blue roof. There indeed is a love story to the history of this exquisite and beautiful palace, yet I shall leave that for the visitor to enjoy on their visit.  One detail in particular that distinguishes this palace from other palaces of the Joseon Dynasty is the palace gardens, and I am already planning my return trip to behold the “Quintessence of Joseon-era Landscaping” in spring or summer, to step where Kings and Queens strolled, relaxed, and perhaps engaged in sericulture. To truly savor visiting the Changdeokgung Palace I need to walk its gardens, valleys, pavilions and behold the lotus ponds and then see the Palace from otherwise hidden views. The Secret Garden occupies more than half of the entirety of Changdeokgung Palace, and I am delighted to plan my return to see the views from the Buyongji Pond and Juhamnu Pavilion, Aeryeonji Pond and Uiduhap, the New Seonwonjeon (New Royal Shrine) and so much more.  In the meantime I hope you enjoy my photographs of Changdeokgung Palace.  Please note that the admission to the Changdeokgung Palace is separate from the admission to the Secret Garden and, at least as of this writing, there is (but verify this) a Royal Palace Pass valid for 3 months from the purchase date, which includes admission to the Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden; the Gyeongbokgung Palace; the Changgyeonggung Palace; the Deoksugung Palace; and the Jongmyo Shrine.",6,much
7,7,111,"From Anguk subway station, head east from Exit 3, and you will find the entrance to the palace. Admission was reasonable at 3,000 won. You get to see the Throne Hall, with the impressive king's chair. Other than that, a lot was under repair, and you don't get to access the King's residence building, so not much to see. We didn't know how or if you could access the Queen's residence building (behind the King's residence building)... so overall, we didn't get to see much; however, the ones we saw were well preserved.",7,much
8,8,121,"Historically palace, if you wearing hanbok , you get to enter for free because Koreans care much about their traditions. Very impressed.",8,much
9,9,131,"Visited the palace first before Gyeongbokgung. Read reviews that this palace was designed to be in harmony with the environment and after arriving there, it can be observed as to how it is. For a Palace, it is certainly not imposing as the Gyeongbokgung one and certainly no surprise why many princes chose to have their palace here. Unfortunately, I did not follow any guided tour for the front part if the palace, thus may have missed much interesting snippets.  However the guided tour to the ""Secret Garden"" is a must. Only entered with a guided tour, they are conducted at different times for different languages. I say it's a must so when you visit, u can imagine how the palace designers have made much effort to be a environmentally harmonious building. Do make a point to visit it.",9,much
10,10,137,"A much often overlooked attraction compared to its more renowned 'sister' palace, the Gyeongbokgong.  The palace grounds are larger and the palace was used as a residence for the royal family back in the old days. Recommend to visit during the autumn due to sights of the structures complemented by the bright colors of the autumn foliage",10,much
11,11,144,This tour includes a guided tour of the palace grounds at night plus a performance at the end if the tour. We were served hot Korean tea in a disposable cup and given a goodie bag containing a purse and a bar of soap. It would have been nice if we were given some traditional Korean sweets instead of the soap. Try the moonlight tour if you want a different experience but do note the price is much higher than the day ticket.,11,much
12,12,152,I went to Changdeokgung Palace on a Sunday afternoon. It has less much people than Gyeongbokgung Palace. But I was not disappointed. I had opportunity to take many beautiful photos with interruption from other tourists. Don't expect grand buildings here as well as other palaces in Seoul. It offers a different kind of beauty and experience comparing to palaces in Beijing.,12,much
13,13,170,I hired the traditional “hanbok” dress to wear to the palace and get nice photos. This place is perfect for photos and the architecture and history is beautiful. Wearing the traditional dress made it more surreal and it really felt like you were there. It is a huge place so bring water and get as much photos as you can.,13,much
14,14,176,Very much enjoyed wandering around this UNESCO site. Now regret that we didn’t do the Secret Gardens but we were tiring.,14,much
15,15,192,"The palaces are beautiful and the grounds are well-landscaped. The original buildings were burned by the Japanese during their occupation of Korea, so these are recreations, but feel ancient. The guides at the library are very kind and helpful providing very interesting information. Take your time, there is a lot to see. It is also common to see people dressed in the garb of that time period which really adds to the atmosphere as you wander the grounds. There is so much history here. And if you are there in the summer, bring the sun umbrellas. It is hot and rain is frequent at that time of year. The little cafe has limited offerings, so you may want to bring food. Note of caution: If you take the Hop On Hop Off bus, they drop you off a quite a ways from the entrance. It is better to get off at the stop prior; it is much closer to the entrance.",15,much
16,16,193,Lovely place filled with history. There is so much to see. We did t have time to do the secret gardens. It was a very good visit.,16,much
17,17,210,"This is the most special of all the palaces and probably the one to visit in case you plan on doing one only. The palace is spacious with large open places. Tourists are not allowed inside much of the covered areas and most of the time you are out in the open. So it can be harsh during summers. But still if you are touring seoul this is one of the must do activities. Just be prepared for the walk and the sun. The secret garden tour is amazing and can only be taken as a guided tour of roughly 70 min duration in summers and 90 during other times. Most of cultural heritage sites including this palace in seoul are free to enter from Aug 10 -25, due to National Liberation Day celebrations...however secret garden tour is paid and needs to be booked atleast a day prior. There is a souvenir and refreshment shop inside for the tourists. From the inside one can also tour the Changgyeonggung palace since the two are connected. The entire tour including the palaces and secret garden can take from 2-3 hours.",17,much
18,18,227,"Absolutely magnificent palace complex. I spent about 5 hours wandering around the inner and outer court before exploring the palace itself and the secret gardens. I was mesmerised by it to be honest. I intended to spend a couple of hours, a half day at most, but ended up spending pretty much a whole day here. The gardens are extra, 5000 won, but are well worth it. The place is stunning obviously but don't rush through the inner and outer courtyards as they are just as enchanting. One of the best days I've had on tour in a long, longt ime and definitely the best and most beautiful attraction in Seoul. An absolute must-do in my opinion.",18,much
19,19,236,"I’d premise this with the fact it was an exceptionally hot and humid day we visited Changdeokgung palace which definitely impacted our enjoyment. The gardens are the main reason to visit and they are lovely (no flowers, all trees and greenery when we went in June - well maintained) but I would say beyond walking around the gardens, there wasn’t much to do. The entry price was only 1,000 won which is cheap but for that you can’t get inside any of the buildings and when it is hot, it’s a bit relentless.  So in short I’d recommend a short visit but not on a hot day.",19,much
20,20,244,"Following the Japanese Invasion both the first and main Gyeongbokgung Palace and this secondary palace were destroyed, but Changdeokgung Palace was rebuilt quickly and then became the main palace. This unique Korean palace was built in harmony with the landscape and is a true beauty. I did not go to the Secret Gardens though. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Walking thru both Palaces and the Bukchon Hanbok Village will take up much of your day so it's best to get an early start and then head to Insadong Street to browse and eat. These are some of the best sites to see in this section of Seoul.",20,much
21,21,251,I think my expectation was way too high and the day I visited was a cold day without much sun. That's why I was little disappointed and it would have been so much better if the day was warmer and brighter.,21,much
22,22,253,"The palace is very nice, but the garden is so much nicer. Lots of trees, so a nice place to visit on a hot day. Entering the garden is kinda weird. You have to buy a ticket for a specific time and only at that time you can enter the garden, even though the sign at the garden entrance says you can just go in on your own. You can choose to do a guided tour or walk around on your own.",22,much
23,23,258,Glad that we sign up for this moonlight tour. The atmosphere at night was so different from the day where it was much more peaceful except that it can be quite scary if you're walking alone. It's so beautiful at night walking around with a lantern on hand.  Get to see more of it and understand better from the guided tour despite having tour this place in the last trip.,23,much
24,24,293,This palace is one of the Joseon Dynasty king's favorite and it is much beautiful and calmer than Gyeongbokgung since it is near the secret garden. It is the only palace in Seoul that has granted UNESCO World Heritage.,24,much
25,25,320,"今年秋天終於排上日程，剛好可以參加古宮的夜間導覽。 ＊注意!外國人只有周日場次。我提前一個月上網買票，因為聽說很熱門，有時可能搶不到票。 前些年已經去過兩次昌德宮，但這是第一次夜間參觀，氣氛格外不同，安靜、神秘、美好。英文導覽員的英文很好，說得不多，但很清楚。記得一定要早點報到，因為是所有隊伍一齊在門外集合，等門開了才會魚貫進入。(自己腦補: 等待的時候有點像古代朝臣在宮門外等候上朝的那種感覺^^) 其實夜間能看到的古蹟特色比較少，畢竟天色已暗。但另有一股韻味(不透露太多，才能好好體會)。雖然收費較高，但包含一場很不錯的國樂與舞蹈等表演，還有小小點心盒。 *注意: 入秋後首爾日夜溫差大，整場tour都在戶外，若當天剛好遇上低溫冷鋒之類的，建議帽子、圍巾、手套都戴上。 *景福宮也有夜間參訪，買票時記得看清楚是景福宮(星光紀行)還是昌德宮(月光紀行)。兩者內容稍有不同，票價與時間長短也有差異。 I visited this palace twice before during daytime. This was my first Moonlight Tour to this ancient palace. It provided a different feel when walking in the quiet night. Open your ears and eyes, for there's music and performance. * This tour is only offered in a limited period ever spring and autumn. For foreigners, only Sunday nights are available, so plan your tour ahead if you're interested. * If you want to really see the beauty of architecture, visit during daytime -- it's really dark during this Moonlight Tour so you won't be able to see much palace features. * They would give you an earphone guide-set and a lantern to light your way. The English guide spoke good English. Note: The more famous palace -Gyeongbokgung- has a nighttime tour too, called Starlight Tour. There's some difference in the content of these two tours. In sum, this Tour is totally worthwhile, and it provides a unique experience. Keep warm, though, for temperatures could drop suddenly in spring/autumn nights in Seoul. Arrive early to check-in -- all visitors would lineup and wait for the gate to open and enter all-together. You can purchase online beforehand. The tickets could sometimes be sold out since this is a popular tour.",25,much
26,26,325,"Seoul has a few royal palaces. Changdeokgung was in use far into the 20th century. The thing with these palaces is; once you have seen one, you have pretty much seen them all. When you visit Seoul for the first time I certainly wouldn’t recommend to go see all palaces. One, two max, is more than enough. Changdeokgung is perfect for a quiet stroll on a lazy Sunday afternoon. From the back gate you can walk straight into Changgyeonggung palace. These two palaces are a haven of peace in busy Seoul. Enjoy.",26,much

28,28,329,"You need to go with the free guided tour they provided, otherwise I don’t think you will enjoy it that much. The structure looks practically the same and there are so many small doors leading to small streets that you may get lost in it. But I like this one better than the gyeongbokgung, maybe because not so many people visiting it so not that crowded, you can really enjoy the scenery and imagine how the life’s like there when it’s still used by the royal family.",28,much

30,30,351,"Changdeokgung Palace was my favorite palace visited on my trip to Seoul. I was here later in the day after visiting Gyeongbokgung and it was far less crowded and more peaceful. The scale is much smaller, but prettier I think. Many of the buildings here were open for display, so you can see what the rooms looked like. There are so many buildings and small paths to walk around here, you can get lost. I did not do the private gardens, I will keep that for next time. The entrance price was cheap and this palace was easy to get to. If you don't have time to visit all the palaces, I recommend visiting Changdeokgung Palace.",30,much
31,31,369,Need to spend a few hours to take it all in. To see how the rulers in every society have lived so much better than everyone else is very telling. Pretty sure I could have be a really good ruler.,31,much
32,32,376,"though smaller than its main sister, the Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeok Palace can hold its own. In fact, I'd much prefer Changdeok due to its size (smaller palace ground) but no less beautiful and intricate. It also has Secret Garden palace (you need extra ticket to get in, famed for its beautiful ground and garden). With Changdeok, you got to see buildings and its functionality, its architecture and also history (progression). The colorful walls and ceilings are such a wonder, the neat design of the buildings are a marvel in itself. It's worth a visit for palace, architecture, and historical geek. You can definitely take great pictures in the compound, because there are many great spots to shoot.",32,much

34,34,391,"There's so much to do and see here as inside there are also entrances to Changyeonggung Palace and the Secret Garden Tour. The architecture of this complex is so outstanding that it was inscribed on the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage List in 1997. Also, I'd highly, highly recommend the Secret Garden Tour, just make sure you get there early enough because there are limited tickets available for each time slot.",34,much
35,35,397,"Not much to see. Buildings from yesterday, almost nothing is original, everything rebuilt in the last years... it is just worthed because what happened arround there... no interest",35,much
36,36,438,"The palace is somewhat small, as the building are all rebuilt to resembles the original structure, looks too good order to be a 600 year old historical site. However, it’s a good mock up to know the history of Korea. A small palace, not really too much to see. King’s life looks boring.",36,much
37,37,445,We love the beauty of all palaces. Hanbok costume brought us back in times. Beautiful set up & we had so much fun there.,37,much
38,38,446,"entrance fee: 3,000 won for entering Changdeokgung Palace (free if dress up in Hanbok); another 5,000 won for entering Secret Garden, booking may be required.  No regret if you cannot enter the Secret Garden due to full booking in summer. Landscape and scenery are nothing special there. It was very humid in July when I went there. But I believe its scenery would be very beautiful when maples blossom in fall.  In general, the buildings of Changdeokgung Palace outside Secret Garden are much better than those in Gyeongbokgung Palace.",38,much
39,39,457,"My mother and I did a secret garden tool of the palace. It was not that great.  The tour was in Chinese since my mother only speaks chinese. It was a free tour offered by the park. The group was about 30 people with some family with young children and seniors.  The tourist guide was not good at all. Her Chinese was not clear, so most of the time we could not understand her. The garden itself is also not what we expected. It's not a botanic garden with flowers and plants, rather it's a big wooded area with natural trees on hills up and down. There were few residence halls here and there. So really not much to see. The guide walked very fast and never bother to check on anybody. It was like a hiking trip with climbing up and downs. The last draw was that the guide lead the group to an almost vertical up stairs in the bushes and just went up without asking anybody if they could do it. I would not risk my mother breakkng her leg gojng up there. So, with some other families with young children we had to look around to find another way out. It was totally unprofessional! We went to see other parts of the palace and didn't find the impressive. All the big halls have tall stairs to climb, so not easy for elderly.  I don't recommend the secret garden tool. Especially if you are not fit for hiking.",39,much

42,42,489,We walk here from City Hall where we were staying. The main entrance is now opened as I remember that it was under reconstruction then. There were guards doing sentry duties and they attracted much photo session. I was delighted to be granted free access being a 'Senior Citizen'. It's the usual visual to see how royalty live in the past. Lots of ground to cover as the site is huge. Highlight for me is to see a lot of folks wearing traditional Korean costume. And many were foreigners renting and wearing them. I said hello to a group of students from Indonesia dressed in the hanboks. I greet them in Bahasa which surprised them.,42,much
43,43,495,"I think if you visit Seoul, you have to go to one of the palaces. We went on a busy, sunny, weekend and it was very enjoyable. There's lots of places to walk around, and it's much different from the palaces and castles back home.  Rent a hanbok!!! There're loads of places nearby, very reasonably priced, and it makes the whole experience more fun. Also, free entry if you do so.  Whilst here we were approached by people (I want to say high school students?) who asked us to vote on things we liked about Korea. No idea why they were doing this, but it was fun to speak to new people. Also a lot of people taking pictures for each other.",43,much

There are very few building that are open, and most that are aren’t terribly ornate. You walk around and look at the exterior of the building with the doors all closed and all the mini complexes have the same architecture. It becomes rather repetitive. I don’t feel like you need to spend too much exploring every corner of the palace, hit the highlights and move on. The Folk Museum you can access for free is probably the best part, very informative on Korean culture. Keep you ticket stub for re entry to the palace grounds.",45,much

They sell separately for secret garden ticket and palace entrance ticket. for me its pretty good deal. I dont have to queue for bought entrance ticket for each palace I want to. Changdeokgung is massive palace, but maybe not as big as Gyeongbokgung. But in this palace there is a secret garden that can only be enter in certain time. and must be guided. it even got secured by 2 security personel. I got here only 2 hours before closed. So I didn't get much around the palace itself. We straight to secret garden entrace, and thank god the guide wasn't there yet. after the guide arrived we enter the secret garden. don't worry the guide was speaking english, also there is a chinese tour for certain time.  the guide told us that Secret Garden can only be enter by the king himself, other people can enter this side of the palace only by king permission.  so its truly a privileges for us to enter this secret garden. the garden is very much preservative and I can see why you can only enter in certain time and with personal guide.  Its like went inside another world, its not like seoul.. when you enter you can only feel peace. the air is different, even though the city just right upon you.  I just want to stay there as long as I could. But I could not because the guide only give us 10-15 minutes spare time for each site we visit. wear a nice and comfy shoes because the walk can take for 1-1,5 hours. and there quite few hills. my friend just went under surgeries last month and can't take the hills very well. security guard was nice and keeping her a company when we continue our tour.  for me if you visit seoul and have extra time. do visit this palace and secret garden for certain.",50,much

For example, it does offer a bit more history and authenticity as it is quite a bit older than the other palace which was only recently rebuilt.

I can imagine how spectacular those would be on a beautiful day and how much they would add to the experience.",53,much

They are similar in many ways - well-preserved, beautiful, with extensive grounds and many buildings to explore - but Changdeokgung has much larger grounds, which you can tour if you have a special ticket. When you first arrive, you can buy an entrance ticket to the palace, and at the same time can ask for an entry ticket to the ""Secret Garden."" This allows you entry at a specified time but doesn't cost anything extra. I've gone twice and once they just let us in at that time and we were free to wander at will. The second time, there was an English-speaking tour guide who showed us a few of the most important sights within the garden. It is amazing how quickly you feel immersed in nature, even though you know you are in the center of a bustling city. It is so quiet and serene - just the thing when city life gets too overwhelming. Definitely wear your walking shoes - the paths are smooth and wide, but the garden is very large and hilly so it requires a bit of stamina to see it all. Young children or anyone with limited mobility will find it tough to see the whole thing.",54,much
55,55,608,"the palace is quite lovely, and would probably be much nicer in the spring, or summer when plants are in bloom. as for the winter visit, there was a lot of large open space, so the wind was blowing, and the temperature quite low. the buildings themselves are lovely. you cannot enter any of them, you just stand at the top of the steps ( 3-5 steps usually) and look into the buildings. however i did start to watch a movie on the flight home called ""the king's case note"" ( by coincidence) and it was filmed inside the actual buildings of the palace, so i got a really good idea of how the king would have lived, and what it would have looked like many years ago!",55,much

I waited 30 minutes in line and lucky to buy last tickets for 15:30 in the morning :) but it totally worth my waiting I was touched by my city. So much history in it and such a beautiful garden. It is different style from China and Japan. Focus on nature itself no artificial no frills very natural! It calms my mind!,59,much
60,60,650,"As far as palace goes, I very much prefer the much grander Gyeongbokgung Palace. But this palace has something that draws you in the moment you step in the secret garden (you have to take a tour for this). My guide is amazing and you can almost imagine the royalties walking the path towards the secret garden for some R&R. The fall colours make the place even more magical than the name suggests, making you wish you have a secret garden of your own too.",60,much
61,61,654,I would definitely recommend you dress the part when visiting the palaces around Seoul. It's a great place to check out the history of Korea and immerse yourself in the Korean culture. It's so much fun to dress up with your friends and take pictures. If your going to rent a hanbok (traditional Korean attire) I would plan to do it for more than two hours so you're not restricted especially if you like exploring and taking pictures.,61,much
62,62,689,We kept our visit of Changdeokgung Palace rather short since there is not much to see. The buildings are scattered in a rather large area. There are no detailed explanations about the life in the palace and the purpose of the different buildings. The gardens are pretty unkempt. Been there done that. If you're nearby have a look.,62,much
63,63,699,"Very interesting site, much of it purposefully left unrestored. Large site, the tour guide stated the grounds covered 110 acres. Make sure you have comfy shoes and are prepared for a lot of walking. If you take to Secret Garden tour, be prepared for some fairly steep grades. It’s definitely not for mobility challenged individuals. One of the members on the tour dragged around luggage for the entire tour. If you take luggage to the tour, do yourself and others the courtesy of storing your bags in a locker at a subway or rail station before you go here.",63,much
64,64,708,"This is a palace that was constructed around 1400 during the Joseon Dynasty. The palace has an impressive gate way which is welcoming and peaceful, also provides an insight into Korean architecture. It is an expansive compound with several structures, Kings council hall, residence, Queens residence, government offices, ornate ceilings, secret garden etc. So there is a lot of walking but not much climbing. It gives a glimpse into the Korean history and way of life. One thing that you take way after visiting the palace is iits harmony with nature.",64,much
65,65,712,"Spent a long day exploring this vast complex great walk and really enjoyed the Museum so much to see, fascinating insight to Korean Culture",65,much
66,66,730,"I was really looking forward to visiting Huwon (secret garden), but I found the tour to be stifling. You can only visit Huwon by tour and there are strict rules to stick with your tour group of 40-50 people so you can't explore by yourself and there's always tons of people milling around--definitely makes for a less-than-peaceful experience. Also, Huwon was pretty, but not breathtakingly beautiful--at least not in the summer. All said, I don't think you'd be missing out on too much if you only visited Gyeongbokgung and skipped Changdeokgung.",66,much
67,67,733,If you're going to select one palace - this is the one.  Many different buildings in this palace area - all with slight differences to suit its purpose. Definitely do the Secret Garden tour - so much lush greenery and a very scenic/peaceful walk through the garden - I would have loved a study/library in a garden growing up!  Look up the tour times before you arrive to make the most of your trip. A few cafes and coffee places across the road from the Palace once you're done with your trip.,67,much
68,68,738,"If you have been in Asia a bit like China, Vietnam...you may feel disappointed. The whole complex is rebuilt so not much impression . The good point is the great museum inside",68,much
69,69,741,"The palace compound is well preserved so it is not too much of a stretch of the imagination to visualise life for the royals and for those living behind the scenes. I got there not long after opening so was able to explore in peace and relative solitude...(before the tour groups)! While you can not enter any of the buildings, it is certainly worth a couple of hours visit. It is also easy to visit Changgyeonggung Palace as you can enter this site from the Changdeokgung Palace grounds.",69,much
70,70,766,It is a very large area. Apart from the buildings there is not that much to see. The grounds are very serene and well kept.,70,much
71,71,778,Beautiful palace in the central of Seoul.... peaceful... Good for taking pictures. cheap entrance fees... not much crowded... mostly kids from school... 1 hour is enough to explore... been to all palace in Seoul... all looks similar... so its better to visit any 2 palace instead of visiting all palaces.,71,much
72,72,788,"Unimpressive palace that looks like a newly built movie set. The gardens are also boring and lacked imagination. Have seen much better and memorable historical sites at other Asian countries than this. e.g. Japan. If you don't have much time in Seoul, can skip this.",72,much
73,73,795,"This was the only palace I had time to tour while in Seoul, but I was grateful for the opportunity. There is so much symbolism to the architecture and furnishings that I would have been oblivious to without a guide. Also, learning how the multiple palaces in Seoul relate to each other was a fascinating lesson. This was an impressive visit!",73,much
74,74,816,"the secret garden stuff is amazing and enjoyable, but other than that everything is pretty much the same as gyeongbokgung, cultural palace. i do prefer the gyeongbokgung but the secret garden stuff is worth it.  and also less people wearing hanbok (other alternative to wear hanbok and take a picture of urself)",74,much
75,75,830,"I had a literal 24 hours in Seoul on a stopover and I was able to tour this beautiful palace with a local friend. The English tour was very informative and I learnt so much about what life would have been like at the palace throughout the ages! The architecture is gorgeous and the interior paintwork is like a mosaic of colour. I didn't have time to go into the secret garden, plus it was the middle of winter, but it was a lovely morning, well spent. They had a useful luggage storage locker facility, which was good as I was hauling at lot of gear.  I fully recommend visiting the palace if you are staying in Seoul, whether for a ridiculously short time like I was or for a longer time.",75,much
76,76,837,"I don't know too much about Korea but this palace compound was built in 1405 so it's well over 600 years old. Interesting to see this in the center of Seoul with all the traffic and other more modern buildings. To be honest, after visiting the Forbidden City in Beijing, any other Asian palace pales in comparison. It was still interesting to travel into Seoul to see it.",76,much
77,77,853,"There is much history here on these grounds! Changing of the guard was amazing and very colorful! The Korean Folk museum was very interesting to spend a few hours out of the hot sun! Beautiful gardens, ponds, and well manicured trees and shrubs! Fantastic background for professional looking photos!",77,much
78,78,863,"It was wonderful place especially in spring! I can see a Korean palace with beautiful sky in harmony. Actually I considered to visit Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung just befort a day of visit. But I'm sure Changdeokgung is better because I've heard several comments about Gyeonbokgung that there are too much people to enjoy that place. However Changdeokgung is good enough to enjoy the gung with nice weather, beautiful building and so on. And I recommend to use an application the ""Real, Changdeokgung"" which guides you based on your location. It is very helpful to tour Changdeokgung. Alwasy it's true that ""Your knowledge determines your insight."" At that point, it was awesome and to wonderful application to visit Changdeokgung.",78,much
79,79,870,"Changdoekgung is by far the best preserved palace in Seoul. While Gyeongbukgung is more famous, it has been altered more. I suggest you take the English speaking tour for your 1st visit, there are usually 2 or more a day. The tour takes you through the grounds and into a couple of the buildings, but more importantly takes you too the Hidden Gardens, ponds, and summer retreat palace buildings. Korean landscaping is much more natural than other gardens.  If you only have a couple days in Seoul, I put this high on the list of places to go. It is in central Seoul and close to Gyeongboekgung, Insadong, City Hall, Myeongdong, and Namdaenum.",79,much
80,80,875,The palace was only 10-15 minutes on foot from Anguk subway station. It might be the most beautiful one in Seoul. The cherry blossom was everywhere in the palace at the time we were visiting it. Walking around it might take less than an hour but we decided to slowly do so with resting and feeling the breeze of history blowing on us. So much enjoyful and peaceful!,80,much
81,81,888,"I appreciate Korean Palaces so much because it shows how much they treasure their history. It was well preserved and strictly kept clean, and thus it has become a highly respected place. I wish the Philippines valued its history as much as Koreans did. :(",81,much
82,82,896,"This Palace is very similar to the Gyeonbokgung Palace, but much smaller. If you are short on time I would go to the Gyeonbokgung Palace. An hour would be enough to see the entire place.",82,much
83,83,905,"The place reminds me of the forbidden palace in Beijing. However, the place is much simpler and smaller.  I'd still say it's a place you must visit on your first trip to Seoul.",83,much
84,84,922,"I went in March and in the fall. I preferred it much more in the fall with the colorful leaves. This time around, it was deserted and quite sad looking. I also went to the Secret Garden and did not enjoy it during March. Go there in the spring, summer or fall. Don't waste your time and money in the pre-spring season.",84,much
85,85,936,"This palace is much smaller than Gyeong Bok palace, but you will definately get a more out of this gem. Changdeok Palace has a garden that is only accesible through tour groups formed at the tocket booth. It is unnecessary to make reservaions if you are in a party under four, they offer walking tours in English, Chinese and Japanese. The royal garden is full of ancient trees, beautiful architecture and landscaping that is particular to the Korean culture, it is less tended and more close to a forest than a typical western garden. Don't hesitate to go on this tour as it is worth your money and time!",85,much
86,86,952,"This palace has much to explore, almost every corner has a magical photo opportunity! Especially with all the pretty girls wearing their traditional clothes. Many are more than happy to pose for you, if you ask nicely! We spent around 3 hours walking around all the small buildings and stopped for coffee in the cafe on the grounds, (decent coffee, not overpriced at 3500won).",86,much
87,87,955,"You can't miss this place. Make sure you go there with lots of time (i would say at least 3hours) to explore the area. And please wear comfartable clothes and shoes because you will be walking a LOT. Paying for the guided tour is important for you to learn a lot the local history. Take time to choose a quiet spot, sit down and observe Korea people who goes there. You would be amazed how much you can learn by observing the way they interact with each other, how they respect their culture and people. I was truly amazed!!!",87,much
88,88,968,"We had an excellent afternoon including a secret garden tour. Without the tour I think it would be hard to enjoy or learn much during a visit, but the information and history provided by the guide during our 75 minute tour were really interesting and nice. Perhaps the group size was bigger than it should have been, but anyway it was a nice afternoon and without the tour it would have been a big disappointment.",88,much
89,89,986,"The palace could be more beautiful during fall, but I visited in winter so it looked the same with other palaces. We booked the huwon garden tour, and again, the tour guide said that the garden was much more beautiful during fall. In winter, it is all snow and frozen ponds. It was nice to hear the tour guide leading us through history, though.",89,much
90,90,997,"Highly recommended for a visit. This huge Palace complex is a fine example of Korean historical architecture and culture. The grounds were stunning, particularly in Autumn - it's a photograper's dream, particularly with the young local people dressed in traditional dress ( a lovely, popular current trend). Very reasonable entrance fee and so much to see there.",90,much
91,91,1006,This palace is neat to look around...not much on display but the area is nice with some fantastic scenery. Whilst there we learned that it is in the process if being rebuilt and so not much of it at all is actually historic.,91,much
92,92,1009,The size of the Palace is average but the buildings are quite well maintained . The secret garden though not much to be seen but can see that it was once quite a beautiful one.,92,much
93,93,1018,"Tip: You can book the secret garden tour a week in advance (I suggest you do so as it's limited to 100 per slot). The English tour starts at 11.30am.  Be at the palace early to roam around and join the 10.30 General Tour (English) around the palace grounds. You will still make it for the 11.30am secret garden tour which takes 1.5 hours.  Following the tours make it so much easier to appreciate and understand the stories behind the buildings. You can either choose to get off Jongno 3 ga station (exit 6) or Anguk station (exit 3) depending on where you stay.  We got the Royal Palace Pass which is 10,000 won and allows us entry to 4 palaces (including Gyeongbokgung) and the Jongmyo Royal Shrine.",93,much

96,96,1049,"We bought tickets for this palace along with tickets for the secret garden tour. Unfortunately, the tour guide for the secret garden had somewhat stilted English (and was thus a bit difficult to understand) and the tour was quite boring, so we just ventured out on our own after a while.  The palace is humongous so be prepared for a very long walk. Also note there really isn't much food you can purchase within the palace itself except for some drinks, so be prepared for that as well.  The palace does get a bit repetitive at times, although the nicely manicured grounds do make up for it.",96,much
97,97,1060,"So much into Korean royalty history. So interesting to see the King's palace and the Queen's palace, how they rule and what their restrictions are. The architecture and very detailed designs of the palace are impressive. They have maintained these sites so well without altering the original set-up. When you're in Seoul, at least visit one of these heritage sites. This requires lots of walking and climbing of stairs. You need need to be fit though but good walking tour.",97,much
98,98,1067,"Very attractive palace buildings with interesting architecture and interiors making a pleasant change from temple visiting. But don't expect to have the place to yourself. It was very busy, but this added to the character as many were in national costumes. Due to time restraints we were not able to visit the secret garden, which is a shame as photos we have seen make it look well worth visiting too. Would recommend having a local guide to make the most of your visit as there is much to understand.",98,much
99,99,1084,Part of the tour was a visit to Changdeokung Palace. Its design is not as detailed and intricate as that of Gyeongbokgung. It is much simpler and there were few people who visited this palace. Considered as Changdeokgung Palace was recognized as a World Cultural Heritage site by the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Committee.,99,much
100,100,1103,"We went to Seoul in June, it was quite hot, I had high expectations about Seoul but so far it was just an average trip that didn't have much attraction. We went to Changdeokgung Palace. I like places with history and story attached to it. I enjoyed the food but didn't love it. I guess enjoying/loving your travel will depend on the places that you go. So maybe next time I will try the outskirts of Seoul.",100,much
101,101,1106,Changdeokgung is a popular tourist spot. Its Secret Garden is hotly sought after in autumn; booking of entry for the Secret Garden of Changdeokgung is via internet (6 days in advance) and all the places will be taken up within an hour or so (booking starting at 10:00 local time). Changdeokgung itself is quite typical but the Secret Garden looks more ancient and has retained much of the original character (despite the re-built). It is a delight to visit the Secret Garden to experience the absolute tranquility and beauty of an ancient garden.,101,much
102,102,1122,"The exterior is not as spacious and grand as Gueongbokgung. However, it's a prettier palace with more trees and a mysterious feel. Go visit the secret garden for a stroll (5000Won per entry) We had a great time enjoying the scenery and breeze inside. There are slopes and much steps at the end of the walk and not suitable for person with walking inconvenience.",102,much
103,103,1129,"It's 3,000W to get in then another 5,000W for the secret garden tour. A nice bunch of buildings but to be honest A LOT of it is inaccessible (you can only look from the outside), there isn't too much in between (the grounds feel sparse), and of course so little of it is original. A huge number of people come here each day so I wouldn't call it peaceful but an ok place to visit if it's the only palace you go to while in Seoul.",103,much
104,104,1132,"I visited on a Wednesday. Contrary to the information in some other reviews, there are many secret garden tours available, including 4 per day in English (this depends on the time of year; see the palace website for full details). Currently, the tours take 200 people instead of the palace website stated 100, this may have been due to Chinese National Day. 50 tickets can be booked ahead and the rest are claimed at the palace. I was able to purchase tickets at 11:15 for the 11:30 tour.  As for the palace itself, very nice and the layout is very different from palaces I've seen before. While some of the layout is perpendicular building and walkway placement, much of it is off at odd angles to meld seamlessly with the natural terrain. This was a nice contrast to the forbidden city in Beijing. The garden tour is definitely worth the time (90 minutes). The tour guide has some useful information and the tour group quickly dwindles to a reasonable size, but you're free to leave the tour guide from the start if you like to do your own thing.",104,much
105,105,1135,"Was expecting more I guess, but the Secret garden is really just a park, not much of a garden. Didn't find it worth the time.",105,much
106,106,1168,"My first time to visit Korea's palace and it was amazing. We took a lot of pictures at the entrance as there was some men who wearing the tradition Korean customs. It was a pity that we didn't spend much time at the palace and wish to try the Korean customs. We also didn't have time to visit the secret garden. For me, I will visit this palace next time.",106,much
107,107,1171,"You need to arrive fairly early if you want to do the secret garden tour after the palace tour. English-speaking guides take the tour around the palace at 10.30am and the secret garden tour kicks off at 11.30am. We turned up a bit late so although we had the palace tour, the garden tour was sold out and we had to wait until 1.30pm for that. Luckily our hotel was very near so we nipped back there as there isn't really another two hours of activity once you have toured the palace. The talk was very good at giving an insight into court life, meaning when we later went to Gyeongbokgung Palace we didn't feel it necessary to join a guided tour. Word of warning to the infirm, the garden tour has some quite steep climbs and quite a lot of older and more overweight vistors found the pace a bit intense, especially in the heat. It's also worth buying the four-palace pass if you intend to visit all the palaces in Seoul. We only did these two, but I'd recommend them both. Gyeongbokgung is much bigger and also contains two fantastic museums. A real must visit.",107,much
108,108,1175,"I enjoyed visiting this gorgeous palace. It has so much architecture and history! The day we went was free entrance and we only had to pay for the English-guided garden tour which lasted an hour. When visiting you can see some Koreans dressed in traditional clothes. It can be very humid and hot so stay hydrated! Also, you can take beautiful pictures so I recommend bringing your best camera. Highly recommended if you are in the area!!!",108,much
109,109,1177,"Changdeokgung Palace is set within a large park in Jongno-gu in Seoul. It is one of the “Five Grand Palaces” built by the kings during the Joseon Dynasty. And as such, it was the principal palace for many of the Joseon kings and a 600-year-old UNESCO World Heritage Site.  We were here for a visit as part of our full day city tour. We arrived at around 9.30am and stayed there for slightly over an hour. It was not crowded when we arrived (perhaps it was still early) and our admission fees had been included in our package tour. But I understand that the admission fee is 3,000 won per adult.  The palace ground was massive, with many ""interlinked"" palace buildings from one to another with a big open compound. Of course what was interesting was the ancient style of architectural design and to some extent, similar to the Chinese style. According to our guide, both ancient China and Korea were good allies and thus the country had some influences from the Chinese culture. (in fact, on the roof top of some buildings were designs of the Chinese classic novel, Journey to the West, with the Monkey God, the Tripitaka Master etc, cool!)  Maintenance and conservation work of the buildings had been done here by the city authorities. So we walked from one building to another, with some being able to enter or taking a look from outside on the interior structure of the palaces, such as the King's chair and office, paintings etc!  Along the way, we also saw some people wearing the traditional Korean Hanbok costumes, very nice, colourful and lovely~ And you are keen, you can try them out too!  As we need to visit several attractions in our tour, we were not able to stay to visit the Secret Gardens which according to our guide, was very beautiful and nice!  For us, the visit here was generally fine and interesting to learn about the ancient culture of Korea though we would love to see more like in Gyeongbukgung Palace. Weather was very sunny and warm and do remember to bring along an umbrella, hat and drinking water.  Well, if you are planning to visit some palaces in your trip here, Changdeokgung Palace is also a good option besides the Gyeongbukgung, though the latter has much more to see, besides the buildings and gardens, bigger, there is also an ancient ""change of guard"" ceremony.  But do take note that the former is closed on Mondays and the latter is closed on Tuesdays!",109,much
110,110,1179,"It is a very charming place, the little lake with white water lily. Well maintained place. You have chance to try their traditional dress for photo as well which was fun. I love the architect of this place very much",110,much
111,111,1183,"You wont need too much time here , just a overall look not more than 30 minutes. This is the most important sign of seoul when you visit . Great place for history lovers. You can also find some tour leaders to receive detailed information.",111,much

113,113,1188,"This palace is really underrated for its beauty. During my second visit to Korea, I went to Changdeokgung and realised that it was so much more beautiful than Gyeongbukgong. Also, It was much better to take pictures/hanbok photos as it is less crowded. I missed out on the secret garden because of itinerary constraints but I would urge people to visit the garden during their visit because it is magnificent.",113,much
114,114,1194,Overall i find the Palace in Korea a bit too boring.Is all a shell other than that nothing much to see and everything thing looks the same. Is a shame when you look into the room is either empty or pretty dull. You want to see the richness of it during those days.I reacon they cold do much better. Only highlight i got was the delicious cold Citroen Tea you can buy at the giftshop.That was a really nice drink freshly made lemon tea with pieces of preserved lemons. Loved it.,114,much
115,115,1200,"We came here because the other bigger palace was closed on Tuesday. It was okay, nothing too special in my opinion. But the architect was interesting. It's 3000 won entrance fee and you have to pay extra for the secret garden, which I think is what everyone wants to see. It's another 2000 won and you can only go as part of a guided tour. There is not much shade so it's pretty hot on a summer's day.  Bukchon Village and Insadong Street are close by.",115,much
116,116,1222,"This was my favorite palace, and was recommended by a local as theirs as well. It truly blends Korean architecture with nature. The grounds are surrounded with trees and is much prettier than the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Only frustrating part was that you had to pay an additional fee to view the secret garden. It was really nice that they had a snack bar with free wifi and AC, as it was really hot!!!!",116,much
117,117,1224,Went there with my wife and son especially to see secret garden. Gosh!!! What a waste of time. Nothing to see in that garden. Mughal gardens in india are much better. Took free English tour. Felt walking in a normal garden. But totally disappointed. Guide used to show a simple hut with no great architecture and give its history. I got to know that I am doomed when they told that the 1st place we will visit iin the garden is the most beautiful place. A big no from my side.,117,much
118,118,1225,"the palace follows the usual style of these types of buildings, There's not really much to see but the interiors of the buildings have a lot of interesting detail and if you can get a tour guide it makes the visit and understanding the context more enjoyable",118,much
119,119,1226,"I'd recommend this as your first stop in Seoul to get a feel for what Korea has to offer. It will most likely also be all the palaces and temples you will want to see for your whole time in Seoul, which is fair because there's so much more to do in the city. Maybe my expectations were too high, but while I found it was nice to walk around and experience something I don't normally see which is of high historic value, I found it a little underwhelming. Although for such a low price it's definitely worth it.  You're free to walk around by yourself without a tour, plenty of opportunities to take photos, the tour isn't really essential unless you want to learn a lot about the history. The Secret Garden tour is reasonably good and gives you enough information about the palace to keep you satisfied. Even then, you're not really missing out if you don't take a tour, but it's still nice to do. Jongmyo is the only place in the area where you've forced to take a tour 6 days of the week, so if you have limited time I'd recommend not taking any tours here.",119,much

123,123,1281,a very good friend recommended to visit join a tour in the secret garden . but english tours were fully booked and korean tours were still available. we took the korean tour. didnt appreciate much what the tour guide was saying but i admired what i see. very nice view. nice to have photos taken as well. but going uphill or taking the stairs is very tiring. recommended only to those very athletic one,123,much
124,124,1295,"The only reason I give it 4 stars, is that like many places in Korea they don't give information or notice about how much walking is required or the terrain. I took my parents here and they loved the rich history, the large spaces, but the walking, especially on a hot day in Seoul can be a lot. Make sure to go into the Palace and see the bench where the King would sit. It still smells musty and the old yellow curtains hang low. The best spot is the Secret Garden, but note this is a long walk with many steep hills and climbing.",124,much
125,125,1305,"The strange history concerning how many times it has been destroyed and rebuilt (portions at least) is fascinating. And from far it looks small but as you approach you see the intricate details and great attention that was laid to each element that makes it so beautiful. There were lots of people, but I found that charming. It was good to have a tour guide to tell us about the nuances of the structures and the layout and some of the stories that make a place so much richer. Not good to go on a rainy day. Worth a visit if you have the time - about 1:30-2 hours is good enough. Then it becomes a bit repetitive.

We didn't join the secret garden tour @3.30pm as it was kinda drizzling and we don't have any umbrella with us today.  The secret garden was where the king spent most of his time together with his most beloved concubine ( whom he couldn't make as his first wife as he wasn't allowed to choose his own wife) He built a house for her next to the garden ( something unheard apparently , showed how much he loved her)",126,much
127,127,1312,Our annual Rotary International convention was held in Seoul Korea this year. We took a few extra days for sightseeing. This Palace was one of the highlights for me. I love history and I love beautiful things. This inexpensive tour combines both of those. I love the way it Korean culture honors its history. This is a beautiful place to visit without spending too many dollars. You can do the whole thing in an hour or two. I also very much enjoyed the museum adjacent to the Palace. Air-conditioned and a nice restaurant inside it was a good diversion in the middle of a hot day. If you can do this with the tour guide it is even better. Too many things that you simply would not understand without having a guide.,127,much
128,128,1325,"I believe you do not need to visit Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace. They are pretty much the same, though the tour we took at Gyeongbokgung Palace was better. The best part of Changdeokgung Palace was The Secret Garden. You can take the tour of The Palace, and then take the tour of The Secret Garden. The Palace tours in English are at 10:30AM & 2:30pm, the Garden is at 11:30, 1:30 & 3:30",128,much
129,129,1336,We took the Secret Garden tour with a knowledgeable English-speaking guide. There are a lot of people who do this tour so I would suggest one to be early as they are punctual. A walk through this Joseon dynasty palatial grounds gives insight into the ways of the Korean royals. The secret garden covers a lot of the palatial grounds with many intricate and unique pavilions and ponds. The setting of these structures was done with much harmony with the landscape. A visit to this palace is absolutely worth it.,129,much

132,132,1384,"We had visited the Geongbokgung Palace the last visit and thought we needed to view the Secret Garden and naturally visit Changdeokgung Palace. The palace is rather small and the highlight would the garden.For this you have to go on the website and make a booking. We chose to go on Christmas Day thinking it would be quiet but our group was large, at least 30 (sure reminds of my school trips!). Give yourself half an hour to visit the actual palace itself. I loved the garden as it was huge, sitting in an area much bigger than the palace. It was a hunting ground for the king in the olden days so as to give you an idea how large it was. It is an oasis of calm in the midst of Seoul! However, you can only visit with a guide and therefore cannot enjoy it as much as it should be. I love to sit and watch the world go by so that is not possible. Lovely and well worth a visit.",132,much

134,134,1405,"I found Chandeokgung to be the most beautiful of all the palaces--and I visited them all! I took two free English-language tours. The first one--a tour of of the buildings and explanation of the history was very hood. The second tour--of the Secret Garden--was only okay. I could barely understand the guide and the Secret Garden was pleasant--but not as impressive as the name conjured. But I was there just before spring, and I suspect it would have been much prettier with the flowers blooming and the trees leafing out. But the palace was ""WOW!""",134,much
135,135,1406,"This is more Korean style palace. That is, it is built according to the nature. The other one - Gyeongbokgung - is more Chinese style which gates and building are all lined up. Even the main gate for this palace is situated in the corner. And they didn't cut down on hills and trees. So it's pretty much of hiking in the city if you take the full course. The palace part is open to everyone except every Mondays, but the secret garden - something more famous - must be reserved beforehand. If you are a small group, there usually are some tickets available at the spot, but I wouldn't risk it. Just reserve it online first. The garden is beautiful and huge and the hills are haha endless. Better wear sneakers. No tough shoes.",135,much

137,137,1428,"Seeing the garden is by tour only. We brought tickets for the palace and gardens when we arrived in the afternoon but because of the afternoon garden tour time we didn't get a chance to see the palace. We found the garden disappointing during our visit in late March. There was not much colour. Maybe it looks more attractive at other times of the year? We felt the tour guide did little more than walk us from one photo opportunity to another, and also felt the tour could have been done in half the time.",137,much

The place has some young men and women dressed in Korea outfit to walk around and stopped for pictures. They are love birds and felt that I was back to the pass and was walking in the palace hundreds of years ago. Not crowded at all, and it was pleasant to walk around. The trees was so nice and the short explore was a much do in Korea.",139,much

The walking areas are sandy dirt, so plan accordingly as your shoes will be a mess when you leave. It had rained/snowed a few days before my visit and the grounds were not in great shape. Worth going, but probably much nicer in spring and summer. I would not pay extra for the garden tour in the winter as there is not much to see.",140,much
141,141,1501,"This Palace is easily reachable by underground or taxi. Most beautiful trees with red leaves mixing other pine trees were all bald at winter time, so it not as colourful as it is in pictures shot in autumn. All buildings were the same and very plain, may interested those architectural lovers. We attempted to pay fee for the secret garden which must be entered with a tour guide but unfortunately one only time with a chinese tour guide on sunday, for the whole day, can you imagine how interested it can be. The palace charge extra money to enter the secret garden but the service is so limited and travellers take so much time to go there. Tour guides in English is also limited. And I did not think I saw any timetable for the secret garden at the main entrance, may be it is a little secret that should not tell travellers. The ticket seller, probably has limited english ability and will just answer the money you need to pay but nothing else. So if you go, it would be better to enquire the tour guide time for the secret garden if you do not want to miss the boat.",141,much
142,142,1503,My husband is Korean. He took me here because he knew of all the palaces this would be my favorite. And it was. It was smaller than the other palaces (but that isn't saying much because this was huge still) I loved it for the natural beauty. It was breath taking. There was a little pond that you would surely miss if you didn't look for it and it was covered in green lily pads. We watched two ducks roam around the waters. This place was a gem in industrial Seoul!,142,much
143,143,1524,This place is full of history. And where a lot of Korea drama are filmed. But not as excited as I thought I would be. It's pretty big but nothing much thou.,143,much

Tourists are only allowed to go into the garden at certain time with the guided tour. The tour guide was very helpful and really explained the idea behind each building and their layout. Tour is around 1.5hrs and basically hiking up and down the hill, because the garden was built on a small hill. The guide also recommended us to come back in the autumn. The palace will be much more colorful than it is in the winter.",144,much

Also if you plan to rent an audio-guide, you are required to leave a passport or photo ID.",145,much

The scenery is nice with lots of trees and plants, the tour also talks about the history of the palace and garden. The secret garden is only open to guided tours, which need to be booked in advance, and the group can get quite big during peak seasons. There are up and down road/stairs and it's a good 90 minute walk.",146,much
147,147,1619,Nice palace to visit. Loads of walking to do.. Very intricate rooftop designs for the inner palace and the rooms of the king and queen. If I remember correctly. A place that you can take nice photos of Korea.  You could take a walk inside but no need to spend too much time for each visit of the sites.,147,much
148,148,1621,"What a gorgeous and amazing palace! It has been rebuilt, but so have many other places that old. We took the advice of a very helpful woman at a tourist information booth in Itaewon, and took the garden tour. Our guide was amazing! Her English was exceptional, and she had a great sense of humor. We learned so much about the garden and its history. I loved the stories, and the beauty of the gardens and building. It was early fall, so the leaves were changing beautifully. What a lovely way to spend time enjoying and learning!",148,much

In tour books it seems like it's a day and for us it was Sunday but nothing was back open as usual until Wednesday!  We walked to gyeongbokgung palace but it was closed!  The palace doesn't seem as grandiose as the Gyeongbokgung palace but I couldn't believe how much more there was to the grounds. We explored on our first and then waited for an English speaking tour to pass and then hopped on. We had to pass time before our secret garden tour. I ""reserved"" online weeks before but it didn't seem to matter when we got to the ticket booth. They say that half of the tickets are reserved and the other half is on the day of. 11yo lasted through 2/3 of it but it was still worth it.

We should have prepared better and done bukchon village which is close or jongmyo shrine which is also close.",149,much

This is a coll piece of Korean history and culture which must have been truly spectaculat in the day",150,much

153,153,1684,"It is best to start your tour of the palaces with this one right here. Crowds are few and tour groups, which are both free and in English, are much smaller. The other palaces you can make do without a tour if you have a guide book, you'll notice lots being repeated in terms of the design of the palaces and structure.  This palace also has a secret garden out back which makes for a pleasant stroll. Note that you are not allowed to wander around the garden by yourself but must go with a tour, you are however allowed to amble around the rest of the palace freely.  It takes a good half day to see everything if you're with a tour. Lots of pagodas, ponds and architecture that must be quite stunning in the fall.",153,much
154,154,1688,"It's a must see in Seoul. However if you come straight after a couple of weeks in Japan (as we did) you cannot help comparing Korean and Japanese temples/shrines and I think Korean ones could have been much improved with a bit of painting, landscape design etc",154,much
155,155,1697,"Went here to see the palace and while it felt a little ""barren"" the architecture was why I enjoyed it. I am a fan of building architecture and yes, some of the building had been burned down and rebuilt, but I wanted to learn about the history of the palace and the signs scattered about allowed me to at least understand a bit about that.  We got the package that allowed us to visit all of the UNESCO sites and, apparently, they throw in the tour of the ""secret"" garden which, well, isn't actually too much of a secret. They also call it the ""rear"" garden which is a much more fitting name. its a large area with some natural pools and very quiet areas. After the first three stopping points it gets a bit hilly so those who are not as ambulatory or are in a wheelchair/use a cane/have problems walking easily on incline surfaces should probably skip the last two stops.  Overall it was a nice place to visit and see the grounds and palace. It is also nearby to Insadong, which is a shopping district (mainly souvenirs) but we strolled there as well afterwards and it was a nice relaxing place to visit.  Overall I'd say at least check it out if you are a fan of history, architecture or both.",155,much
156,156,1699,"One of South Korea's most popular tourist attractions. At the entrance there is a Changing of the Guard, somewhat of a Korean variant on Buckingham Palace, with traditional costumes and music. I believe this place can be crowded at times, but Friday noon it was ok. The park is large with another large garden, the further you will walk into the park, the more quiet it becomes. And that is the moment where you really get to enjoy it. Peaceful relaxation and stunning views into the mountains. I am normally not much of an historician but would like to come back here one day just early in the morning or late in the evening.",156,much

We sat under the pagoda and just sat in peace under the shade from the humid weather . There was a entrance fee which wasn't much but so worth while to see .

It had been rebuilt after a fire. I actually do not remember much but the crowds.",163,much

The Guided tour in English started at 10:00hrs but we were there by 9:00hrs and we already look around and took photos. This is recommended if you like to focus on the interesting history talks of the tour guide wearing Traditional Korean Hanbok while showing you around the palace. It will take an hour till your next tour to the Secret Garden. That's why you don't have time to take much photos because there's a lot of places you will be visiting with the group (in fast pace) then next going uphill to the garden. You must wear running shoes, enough sunblock, insect repellent, water and eye shades as you are going to do some hiking. We visited the area during summer (June 2015). The tour in the secret garden and the admission fee are separate purchase at the ticket booth. But since you are already there, you might be up to doing some adventure while discovering the King's hide out when he needs to be alone and relax. Definitely a must visit!",167,much
168,168,1766,This is definitely one of the most beautiful places in Seoul. The carefully curved and colorfully decorated buildings look really marvelous. When walking along I had a chance to admire the old builders' effort. That gave me the chance to imagine how much the Koreans respected the emperor's authority. The buildings are perfectly set inside the peaceful park. This is very Asian style which philosophy is to cooperate not interfere with nature. Walking along the gardens was a very relaxing experience for me after the hustle and bustle of contemporary Seoul. To sum up this place is one of Your must see list when in Korea.,168,much

But note that the Piwon is only open to guided tours that are alternatively in Korean, Japanese and English, so make sure to check the schedule and get there early because the tour of the Piwon is very popular. Also, be prepared for a long walk uphill and downhill through the Secret Garden, which must be as large as the gardens at Versailles but is much more rugged terrain. There's a fee for the Secret Garden, but it's only about $5 and it's worth it. I went with a friend on a very hot day in July and it was exhausting but worthwhile. The gift shop has a little cafe and is air conditioned; they also have expensive but nice souvenirs as well as wi-fi (the only place on the grounds of the palace with wi-fi). When you leave, walk out the main gate to the right and walk just a few blocks and you'll be in Bukchon Village, which is also really worthwhile; it's also a good place to eat lunch or dinner.",169,much

Interesting history made this a very worth while location.",170,much

One thing I love about Seoul's historical attractions is that they include free English tours, you just have to make sure you have the times right and that you are on time. Unfortunately I missed the last secret garden tour, which is said the be the highlight. Nevertheless, I found the tour to be fun, interesting, and very informative. Really, don't miss the tour, it is 70% of the experience. I found it more interesting than the main palace, Gyeongbukgong, equally beautiful, and much less crowded.",171,much

Changdeokgung is the only UNESCO World Heritage site out of the Five Grand Palaces built by Joseon dynasty which ruled Korea. Magnificent piece of authentic ancient Korean architecture.  There are many tour operators who offers a package of Changdoekgung with night markets etc., but you will need to enquire first whether they will take you into the 'Secret Garden'... you SHOULD NOT miss it. I booked with an operator, and upon learning that they will only provide entry to the palace and not the 'Secret Garden', I decided to abandon the tour midway and be on my own.  The palace and 'Secret Garden' tickets are sold separately, and 'Secret Garden' is opened to a batch of tourists with a Palace guide guiding you on the trail once every 15-30 mins. So, you may have to get in there, and plan for a secret garden ticket with a slot an hour at least from when you reach (sometimes there is quite a rush, and number of tickets per slot is limited to a maximum 30 ish). I spent the hour seeing the palace, and then went for the Secret Garden tour, which is technically 70% of the palace area.  It was worth a wait. Lush-green tree-rows with beautifully crafted lake-houses .... the flora was just amazing. ... I wonder if I liked the whole trail so much in summer, how good it will be during the spring season..  The only flip-side which I will regret - taking a Korean tour of 'Secret Garden' [every slot of Secret Garden tour is in a specific language and only few were in English] since the next English tour available was still couple of hours more of wait. so couldn't make much out of the context. But hey.. you always have a Wikipedia, it's the visual and other sensory experiences that matter...",175,much

This Palace has lots of history than Gyeongbukgong. if I remembered correctly from the guided tour. And the story about the last Prince (or was it King?), who rebuilt a quarter especially for his lover, was so romantic. If you are not travelling with kids, I really recommend that you have to follow the guided tour as the guide knows so much.",176,much
177,177,1850,"In my opinion, this palace is much more worth visiting compared to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The minute I stepped onto the palace ground, the palace seems to reach out to you, eager to share its history with you. The palace is of a considerable size and you need to take your time to appreciate each and every building. As the halls and living quarters are built apart from each other, every time I looked into a hall or a living quarter, I try to imagine how life was like for a royalty back in the Joseon period. It would be great if you can hire a guide or get an audio guide to help better understand the rich history of the palace. As I went to the palace after mid-noon, we missed the guided tour to the Secret Garden located just beside the palace. Make sure you check the timing for the English tour and head down early to book a spot.

Probably in general it is the same for the others palaces as well -- Gyeongbukgung, Deoksukgung. The only difference will be in the details. The secret garden is ok but truly a very long walk and especially not for those too tired after visiting other areas in Seoul. Its a series of walk up and down small hills.

Lots of obnoxious high schoolers running around unsupervised, making noise, etc.  If you're in Seoul you should go, but compared to some of the other places in Asia I have been, it wasn't that great.  Just my opinion.",181,much

It was part of the Seoul Culture Tour - a free 5 hour tour (10 am to 3 pm) provided by the airport for passengers on long layovers. It was very cold - 10 Celsius, and the Airport even provided free down parkas. The Palace is well preserved. It was educational and picturesque. We learned a lot about Korean history and culture and very much enjoyed this introduction Korea. Per our guide the best time to visit South Korea is March and April. Winter is cold and summer is hot and muggy.",188,much
189,189,1943,"If you have never been to China and visited the palaces around the Forbidden City, then this will be a good experience of an Asian palace. if you have visited Beijing and toured even the palaces of the princes, then you can skip this.  It's much smaller than I thought and may be it had to do with the Korean history, but the palace seems to be pretty basic. Like a poor man's version of the Forbidden City.",189,much
190,190,1949,I decided to visit the palace as I had never seen something like this before. There was a relatively cheap entrance fee and there were not many people so the trip was very slow paced and relaxing. The grounds are quite large so give yourself about 2 hours to see it properly and read the information boards along the way which explain the historical significance of the palace. There are many buildings to see and appreciate the architecture of the time. There are guards at the front gate wearing traditional costume with whom you can take some photos with if you wish. I enjoyed it very much.,190,much
191,191,1953,"Nice place to go visit. Went on a weekday. Much better, as little traffic. It was a cold day, so i rushed through it. Don't expect to see a palace like those of Turkey and England. Its very much outdoor based.",191,much
192,192,1957,We visited here on a tour and really enjoyed the site. It speaks to the history of Korea. I suspect that if it was raining we would not have enjoyed it as much as we walked on a lot of sand that I guess would turn into mud when it rains.,192,much

A dream come true to me that my hubby bring me to Korea last November until the first week of December as an anniversary gift. Although the weather that time is so cold, we explore the expansive area as much as we could. I really fell in love to the place and thinking back in times how they live their day to day life in this very large area. Of course, don't forget your cameras for your photo ops as a proof that you visited the area. There's a coffee shop near the entrance if you want to relax first after your exploration.",193,much
194,194,2012,Many Things were built by wood and due to many wars and fires there are not many historical places ( such as palaces and grand religious places like in Europe ) and I believe this place is the best that you can get in Korea.

195,195,2023,"We planned to visit Changdeokgung Palace because it is one of the World Heritage properties and Secret Garden (inside Changdeokgung Palace) with beautiful Autumn leaves.  There are two kinds of tickets, one is for Changdeokgung Palace only (3,000 won) & the other is Changdeokgung Palace + Secret Garden (8,000 won with tour guide). We made ticket reservation on its website 1-week before the trip, all Chinese & English speaking tour guides were fully booked, we Chinese only had to book a ""Japanese"" speaking tour guide at 12:30 pm. If you want to know every place of its history, it is highly recommended to make the reservation on its official website as early as possible for a understandable language. No advance payment is required.  Upon arrival at the Secret Garden, we were a bit disappointed because it's too early for the beautiful Autumn leaves at the end of October, not much were seen. However, the weather is nice and comfortable, it took us 2.5 - 3 hours to walk, take pictures and enjoy the environment (without following the Japanese tour guide). It is a nice & relaxing place to visit. We may learn more of Its history on its official website or UNESCO's.",195,much

197,197,2047,"We arrived and realized that we had visited 6 years earlier. We paid the entry fee and went in anyway. We had the same impression that we had on our prior visit. It is impressive, but it is stark and bare, leaving too much to our limited imaginations. The last time that we visited we took a tour in English and paid the extra fee for the Secret Garden, only accessible by tour. Both were well worth the fees and time spent. This is a UNESCO World Heritage site and while we would never want it turned into a Disney version of a palace, it would be great to see an exhibit (drawings, models, film) of what all of these buildings were used for and what they may have looked like when the palace was inhabited. Next to the Secret Garden entrance was an entrance to another palace, the Changoyeonggung Palace. It was only about $1 each and it turned out to be the highlight of our day. I understand an additional fee for the Secret Garden, but would have preferred that the visit was not limited to a guided tour. I also would have liked that a brochure be offered with the entry fee or for an additional charge. There were a few plaques in English throughout, but more information and history would have been a great addition.",197,much
198,198,2049,"Changedeokgung is a beautiful palace albeit much smaller than Gyeongbukgung. It was not too crowded when we visited on a Tuesday. We bought combination tickets for $10k Won each which allows one to visit the various palaces in Seoul as well as the Jongmyo Shrine. This includes the Secret Garden too. If you plan on visiting at least 2 of these attractions, it is worth buying the combination tickets. We arrived early and were able to join the first English speaking tour for the morning. It is good to join the tour (free) as the guide will provide commentaries and information as well as historical background to the many buildings / rooms within the palace grounds. We particularly enjoyed the little snippets the guide shared with us regarding the daily lifestyle & stories of the Kings & Queens who lived there. The tour last about an hour and it ends near the entrance to the Secret Garden. This was very well planned as we could immediately make our way to the next guided tour to the Secret Garden scheduled at 1130am. The Secret Garden tour took about 90minutes and we had a nice relaxing time there. Some portions of the gardens are quite steep but the guide always allow a short time of rest for us to recover before moving on.",198,much

If you're taking the city tour, the other one is stop #22 and this is #23. Take 23. It's a much larger palace with a secret garden. .secret garden is a different fee to get in and I didn't go there but I've read that it's one of the main attractions not to be missed. This palace (grounds) is much larger with beautiful architecture.",200,much
201,201,2070,"I had pre-booked my Huwon (Secret Garden) Tour online and I would recommend visitors to do so. Although you will still have to queue to retrieve your tickets, at least you are guaranteed for the tour, in your preferred language (and you will be aware of the relevant time slots too). The land area is massive and there is much to explore in Changdeokgung Palace even without the Huwon; however, I reckon one might get bored easily without a guide. One positive thing to note is that due to its size, I didn't feel that it was too crowded although there were many visitors (even local groups bringing their children along for study trips).  The Huwon tour though is definitely my highlight to Changdeokgung Palace. The Huwon harmonises with its natural terrains as its pavilions and gardens are built on slopes and around its large hills. Hence, most of these beauties are hidden from sight, if you are not following the tour. On the other hand, the route may be difficult as there is some hiking involved (just a tough on the elderly) and the tour would be almost impossible for those bound on wheelchair as maneuvering around it gets really tricky. Be prepared, with a good pair of walking shoes.",201,much

Too much dust and open space, some pleasant vistas but the backdrop of hi-rise is a real annoyance. Very tricky to get real quality photos here. I had to focus on close-ups. Very average for the price....",202,much
203,203,2099,"The palace is a very nice place, and with much less people than the major palace in Seoul. Some of the buildings and gates are original and dating from early 15 century. 1 hour to 90 min should be ok for a good visit. The tickets are cheap, as all the major attractions in Seoul, for this one for example the entrance is around USD3",203,much
204,204,2104,Or maybe I have seen too many palaces. We did the English tours of palace and garden. I wish the guide had not made it seem so much like work for her and for us. But it was ok. Just not great.,204,much
205,205,2116,I visited the palace on a weekday and found that it was much less crowded than the Gyeongbokgung Palace which was nice since this allowed for time to stroll around and take pictures. The whole complex was very beautiful and it was really interesting to see the original-type architecture of Seoul. I didn't do the Secret Garden tour but found that I really enjoyed the palace regardless. Definitely worth the admission price and there are brochures and information boards throughout so you get an understanding of which buildings were used for different purposes.,205,much
206,206,2118,"You can visit it now with an entrance fee aside from that needed to enter the palace itself. Though every last Wednesday of the month the palace entrance is free. I have been inside the Deoksugung Palace which is closest to the town center, Changdeokgung is much bigger and with an English tourist guide (scheduled), I had a better appreciation of the history of the palace i.e the history of rooms, space, engravings etc. My group wanted to have our own free walk in the Secret Garden because we were short of time but we were not allowed too – seems that visitors have to follow the guide once inside the garden. It is quite huge, to make sure the queen was not bored or/and having a feeling of melancholy being forbidden to step outside of the palace. Almost like being outside, it’d be more beautiful in the fall or winter.",206,much
207,207,2122,"I have not seen Changdeokgung in the daytime, so this review is strictly about the Moonlight Tour. I was looking forward to the tour with great anticipation, as it is only offered to foreigners six nights a year, with a limit of 100 tickets per night. I made a special point to be online and order tickets the minute they went on sale, that's how much I wanted to take this tour.  The tour was offered in English, Chinese, and Japanese, and attendees were divided into groups accordingly. That part was good. I expected the pathways, buildings and garden to be illuminated (not brightly so as to recreate daytime, but at least so that we could see what we were being shown) but sadly, this was not the case. A small number of attendees were asked to carry paper lanterns as we walked the grounds, and there were a few lights on the buildings, but I couldn't really see much. The pathways were unlit (the few paper lanterns scattered about were ineffective), and the ground is quite uneven, with random obstacles on the path (something which looked like pipe vents, at one point there was something that looked like an empty concrete pond, completely unlit, which someone could easily have tripped into), and we were marched from building to building very quickly. There was a lot of hiking up stairs and then down stairs, all stone, all uneven, all unlit. What could have been a pleasant walking tour felt more like a march in the dark. We were ""treated"" to a tour of the rear ""secret"" garden but were unable to see anything - I mean absolutely nothing. So what was the point of taking us through the garden? I'm still not sure.  When we reached the pavilion at the end of the garden, there was one building which was beautifully lit, with a large (unlit) pond in front of it. A musician played a traditional Korean gayageum, and we got to sit and listen for about 10 minutes. This part of the tour was quite lovely.  Tea and traditional Korean sweets were part of the tour, but the tea was served in paper cups - take one as you walk past a table, and keep moving - and the sweets were handed to you in a (very nice) fabric bag. I didn't expect a formal tea ceremony, but I also didn't expect a paper cup. This was just one more disappointment.  From there we sat as an audience in front of a stage area, where we were treated to another lovely musical performance consisting of several different types of performances. This was the highlight of the tour. If this had not been included, my rating would have been ""poor"" rather than ""average."" After that, we had to walk about 15 minutes back to the entrance, with no guidance, minimal lighting, and, once again, hidden obstacles.  Cost: 30,000 won per person. I would not recommend it. Go in the daytime, walk at your own pace, and you will undoubtedly get much more enjoyment for much less money.",207,much
208,208,2129,Look I have to start with a disclaimer and say that old palaces and the like tend not to be too much of my thing. That said I did enjoy the trip here and really do recommend taking the time to make your way here if you are in Seoul. The guides are really very knowledgeable and the gardens within the grounds of the palace are well worth checking out. If not for any other reason that you are in a busy and bustling city yet are in what is really a quite secluded and serene garden and nature walk. I suppose it is the juxtaposition that is most striking about it.,208,much
209,209,2130,"Its a beautiful palace with a huge amount of grounds and wasn't overly crowded. I have to say despite its beauty I did find it a little bit samey in design/architecture without much variation from the style. Its worth a visit, and get a guide if you can because its very thorough and informative. Takes about 1-2 hours to look around. There is access to the 'secret garden' but it costs more so we didn't go. Try and go when its sunny as the colours on the buildings are better! Near to Insadong and other palaces/temples. This is easy to find (its huge) and is about 10-15 minutes away from various metro stations.",209,much
210,210,2155,"The palace itself is interesting, but lack of any identification of what the buildings were or their significance to the historical period has you looking at a lot of buildings that all look very similar. Once you've seen one or two, you've seen them all. The Secret Garden is also interesting, but it too has many of the same structures without much difference in their historical value. It was interesting but not worth 90 minutes. Guided tour is large group with single guide, you can easily miss our out the naration.",210,much

212,212,2190,"This is my second palace tour in Seoul and while the throne hall is not as ""grand"" as the one in Gyeongbokgung Palace, it has its own charm and I love it!.  The palace is not that crowded or maybe our guide simply took us on places that were not part of the official tour given by this place. I'm glad I signed up for this free tour and because it's a small group, we get much better chance to ask more questions and stray away from the usual pack of tourists roaming around. I love the fact that some areas are really quiet where you can simply sit down on an open balcony and admire the beauty of its surroundings.  The structures of this palace is great and true to its description, it follows the natural topography of the site instead of imposing themselves upon it. I also love the short hike on the natural garden at the back of the palace.",212,much
213,213,2191,"This palace is much more beautiful than it's big brother to the east. Changdeokgung has a more cobbled together feel, and somehow a more Korean feel than the large rectangular layout of Gyeongbokgung. The gardens are a highlight. Try to get on a tour of the back garden if you can, but if you miss the slot just wandering around the palace grounds is a treat. Especially good in spring and autumn.",213,much

216,216,2211,"I joined the Secret garden tour as I missed the free tour. The secret garden was great and the tour guide was great. But I believe it would be much more interesting to listen to stories for the palace rather than the garden. Nevertheless, the tour and palace is worth seeing.",216,much
217,217,2213,"Changdeokgung Palace is a charming historical place that should be on everyone's Seoul itinerary. While Gyeongbokgung Palace is the more popular and larger attraction, Changdeokgung offers a more personal and intimate experience because of its smaller (but still expansive) compound and the lovely Secret Garden. There are two guided tours here - the outer main buildings and the Secret Garden. I highly recommend both. With so much history and information to absorb, it would be an injustice to the place if you walk around on your own. The Secret Garden, by the way, can only be accessed via the official guided tour. Our tour guides on both tours were outstanding and spoke excellent English. Their knowledge was, of course, extraordinary, but they also made great effort to talk clearly and slowly. The buildings of the palace were most interesting to me.This palace as I understand it was mainly for living more than ceremonies. It was fascinating to see living quarters of royalty as well as those that served it. Spanning centuries, the palace remained in use until the last century. The tours took us not only through the buildings, but indeed through time. The Secret Garden was fun but busy with scores of people joining the tour. While hearing the tour guide commentary was difficult at times, we did get the chance to see some striking pavilions by pools and walk along tree-lined paths that really made my day. Anecdotes and tidbits delivered by the guide enhanced a really good visit.",217,much
218,218,2216,We spent about four hours at this palace. The secret garden is beautiful but not for people unable to walk distances or climb stairs. We enjoyed our visit very much. It was the first palace we visited on our trip.,218,much
219,219,2218,"We were disappointed. Although this site is nicely preserved, there wasn't much to see. There was an extra entrance fee for the secret garden, which according to the guide books was the gem of this site. We didn't go in unfortunately. Strollers? Impossible to lug up the huge stone steps in front of every building. Families with young children need to be better prepared than we were.",219,much
220,220,2222,"It is easy to find fault with the Palace but that would be missing the point. The site is readily accessible, good value, and interesting in its context. We were not on a tour and found taking our time to wander where we liked a more relaxing approach and signage was adequate. Restoration and reconstruction efforts have resulted in an historical 'oasis' amongst the hustle and bustle of modern Korea. For certain, it would be nice to walk around inside the buildings and see fully furnished interiors but that is unrealistic for large numbers of visitors, the wear and tear would be too much. We found it interesting to discuss the similarities and differences with other Asian palaces we have visited. The setting and the landscape both contribute to the experience.",220,much

The place - just average for me - nothing much to see and gardens were just okay.",221,much
222,222,2247,This palace is an easy walk from Anguk station on the orange line. Adult admission for the english language palace tour + secret garden tour was around 18000 won. There is an english brochure for 500 won. We took the 10:30 am palace tour followed by the 11:30 garden tour. The garden tour was 1.5 hours long. You can tour the palace on your own but to see the gardens you must be with a guide.  The guides wear traditional hanboks and both of my guides spoke good english. The palace tour is interesting and there was enough information without being overloaded with trivia. The garden tour however was more about the scenery. The lady talked about the functions of the different areas of the gardens but it wasn't very compelling. Also it was more enjoyable to not be in the throng of 50 people that were on the tour and to straggle behind.  I found this palace more interesting than Gyeongbokgung and it is much larger than Deoksugung.,222,much
223,223,2248,"How to get there: Anguk Station, Exit 3  We toured Changdeokgung last April 15. Our tour guide informed us that unlike the Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung is more of authentic Korea-style palace. Inside Changdeokgung are another attractions which are the Secret Garden and Huwon, wherein you will pay for another entrance fee.  Entrance fee for the Changdeokgung is KRW 3,000. But with the Integrated Royal palaces (IRP) Ticket for KRW 10,000, you may visit Seoul's 4 palaces and Jongmyo shrine as much as you want for a month.",223,much
224,224,2253,"Changdeokgung Palace is much more tranquil than the other two major palaces of Seoul. It is surrounded by lush gardens and greenery, which even in the winter’s snow can make Changdeokgung look remarkably picturesque, rivalling perhaps even the wintery sight of the incredible Ginkaku-Ji temple in Kyoyo, Japan.  The main garden here is called Huwon which is 78 acres of amazing tranquil greenery. Depending on the season, you can see snow, autumnal leaves or possible some cherry blossoms.  Changdeokgung is the longest-serving royal palace in Seoul, and this made me want to visit it to see what the fuss was about. I enjoyed an hour or so looking at the intricate architecture, but to the untrained eye you must remember that a lot of these palaces and buildings within them all look very similar, so unless you have a particular interest in Joseon Dynasty era palaces, then I think you should prioritise your palaces, and thus I must recommend Gyeongbokgung.",224,much
225,225,2254,"Our first palace visit in Seoul was Gyeongbokgung. That was a great introduction to the Joseon dynasty, and our visit to Changdeokgung added to that experience. The history of this palace is covered extensively elsewhere, and all the practical information required is in the excellent KTO page http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264348  We bought an Integrated Ticket of Palaces which covers Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, Gyeongbokgung and Jongmyo Shrine. This was excellent value at 10,000 won.  This time we managed to join an English speaking tour, and we learned so much about life in the royal palaces in that era. As with Gyeongbokgung, there are seats dotted around, so you can bring a picnic or rest your weary feet.  The English tours to the palace are at 10:30am and 14:30, and the English tours to the Secret Garden are at 11:30 and 15:30. We started with the 10:30 palace tour followed immediately by the 11:30 garden tour, and this proved exhausting, especially for my parents who are in their 70s. If time permits, my advice would be to have a break in between the tours by heading to nearby Insadong or Bukchon, with its art galleries, independent craft shops, cafes and restaurants.  You could even consider returning on another day for the Secret Garden. On no account should you join in another language group for the garden tour, as visitors all have to stick together and you are not permitted to wander off on your own. You will be stuck for 90 minutes with a guide speaking in a language you do not understand.  Take this visit at a leisurely pace. This is Seoul at its historical and cultural best and it would be a shame to factor in Changdeokgung as simply one more thing to cross off your Seoul 'to do' list.",225,much

It was quite long but very informative and good to get away from the palace crowds for a bit.

Just wish that there was more to see in the buildings as, apart from the throne room, everything is pretty much empty.",228,much
229,229,2290,we visited in November so it was very quiet which despite the cold was actually very nice and peaceful as it felt like we were the only group around! we bought the combination ticket which allows entry into several palaces including the famous secret garden in this palace.  I would definitely recommend to book a tour of your language of choice as this makes the walk around much more interesting instead of walking around an empty palace! The tour guide was very informative and spoke great english.  I enjoyed the secret garden the most and it is possible to get some beautiful shots here! we managed to even catch some autumn red leaves!  if travelling in the winter do make sure to wear comfortable shoes and wrap up! the palace ground tour lasts for 1hour and then the secret garden tour for 90 minutes.,229,much

But I didn't see much difference between both palaces (building and the grounds). Didn't get to visit the garden as we missed the last English tour which is at 2.30pm. Probably we should have come during other seasons as the palace looks bleak and melting snow was dripping from the roof during winter.,230,much

This was very disappointing but the palaces and garden area was still very beautiful. I would definitely recommend a tour because the grounds are beautiful on their own but the stories make it so much more interesting. There is quite a bit of walking but it is mostly flat so I found it fine to wear sandals but be prepared to walk a lot.",231,much

There are small signs here and there, and large signs with lots and lots of info. I also wish I was able to book a secret garden tour which was not available to be day of because it seemed all the tour groups had booked it. Nearby is a children's museum which was fun for me.

The english tours at all of them are 11 1 and 3 with changing of the guard on the hour. I would definitely take the tour so you know what your looking at.

Be sure to catch the free English tour for a better appreciation of the palace, the history of Korea, and the lives of the royal family.  Within the Changdeokgung is the Secret Garden (separate fee; with tour guide), which for me was overrated, and can be skipped as there is not much to see. Given all the walking (up and down slopes and stairs) that I did, the garden wasn't just impressive enough.",238,much

Changdeokgung has a 'secret garden' but don't expect too much, it's really more of a small forest with some forgettable pagodas scattered around. It's pretty, but not a must-see. If you've only got time for one palace, choose Gyeongbokgung.  However, Changdeokgung is very close to Insa-dong, a fun neighborhood for souvenir shopping, so if you want culture and shopping all at the same subway stop, this might be your palace.",239,much

The admission fee is 3,000 KRW, and if you would like to visit the secret gardens, that is an additional 2,000 KRW (please check their website as I did not choose the secret garden option).  If you have made it to the Changdeokgung Palace, do not miss walking through the Bukchon area (next to the palace). Go to the information counter to get a Bukchon map. You can even catch a different view of the palace grounds from Bukchon.",240,much

The secret garden is also here but requires another entrance fee, so we didn't see it. I heard it's really beautiful inside. If you're not much into palaces, like me, visiting one will be okay I think. Since most palaces are under the Joseon dynasty, they practically look all the same to me.",245,much

Both in English. For the palace tour (KRW 3,000), the guide is and old lady, clearly explain the history of this palace and all. I think, if times allow, it is better you join this tour because it is a waste to only look at this beautiful buildings without knowing the story behind it. But, if you too concern about your time (ya, there is a lot to do in Seoul in 1 day), you can skip this.  Just after I finished the Palace Tour, I continue with the Secret Garden Tour. It will cost you KRW 5,000. I have to warned you, it is not and easy tour, because you will hike up a small hill, do a lot of walking here. A good and comfy shoe will help you a lot. But do not worry so much because the guide is good enough to arrange sufficient stop for you to catch your breath. On top of that, if you are not able to finished your tour, just let her know, and she will point you the nearest exit to you. Just for you to know, this Secret Garden is not actually a garden, it is more to a forest behind the palace. So, if visiting a beautiful forest is not your thing, don't go. As for me, it is worth a visit.",249,much

Entrance fee to the garden must be combined with the palace tour- very cheap at 9,000 won. We went much earlier than our 1130AM guided tour to the Garden. Presented our reservation confirmation form to the cashier, paid the fee and went around this beautifully-preserved Palace. Unlike our last year's rain-filled visit, the weather this time was sunny yet cool. 5 minutes after 1130, our big group was herded to the Garden. It was enchanting.

263,263,2567,"This is the second palace visited on a Saturday (after Gyeongbokgung Palace) and is the only World Heritage Site of the 4 palaces. Arrived around 1pm and spent about an hour here following the numbering of the buildings in the provided brochure. Ticket costs KRW3000 (~USD2.70) with an additional fee to visit Huwon. If one is keen to see this ""Secret Garden"" then advanced booking is best. It seems the regular ticket will allow one to see many structures in this palace complex, but cover less than half of the area (Huwon is rather large).  The brochure which came with the ticket is an excellent one and quite sufficient for navigating through the complex, with rather substantial information for identifying unique features of the buildings and understanding the architecture. Changdeokgung minus Huwon seems much smaller than Gyeongbokgung and takes a shorter time to visit. However after seeing much in Gyeongbokgung, this required a bit more effort to appreciate. Also, worth noting is that the crowds seemed unavoidable here, probably due to the small size of Changdeokgung, the fact that it was visited later in the day and on a weekend.  Thought the blue tiled roof of Seonjeongjeon was rather unique, but personally found the Nakseonjae Complex stood out the most because of its simplicity, reflecting the character of the King who lived here.  Overall, a very good visit to Changdeokgung, and a worthy inclusion to exploring Seoul. Note that this palace is closed on Mondays. Also there is a month-valid combination ticket to visit the other three palaces and Jongmyo shrine nearby. These are all within walking distance but would be rather difficult to properly appreciate in one full day.  If coming by metro, Changdeokgung is accessible by Line 3 (Anguk station) Exit 3.",263,much

If you have the chance to do the moonlight tour, even though it is much more expensive (30,000 won) it is totally worth it. They tour you around the grounds and at the end there is an amazing performance of traditional Korean music, dance, and singing.",264,much
265,265,2570,"Must be the size of the place. It's much smaller compared to Gyeongbokgung. And you definitely must try and fit in for a guided tour.

267,267,2600,"For somewhat who is interested in East Asia history, one must visit this palace. There is a very real difference between Chinese and Korean royal buildings. Korea's last dynasty Joseon, was Confucian in principle and practice, and I might add far more Confucian than later dynasties in China (where Confucianism originated).  This difference is apparrent in palace architecture and royal tombs. While the Forbidden City Palace is perhaps the most grand palace in the world, Changdeokgung is rather simple, not in a bad way. This is by design. Moreover, while Chinese tombs were designed often as monumental structures by the Emperor destined to abide there, in Korea the view was different.  Joseon strictly adhered to Confucian princliples, which are very concerned with humility, filial devotion, and the dignity of simplicty. Therefore, concerning palace and tomb architecture it was ideal to construct buildings that showed the dignity and honour of the dynasty, but equally important was humility in design. Feng Shui was also far more important than grandiosity, much time was spent by geomancers to select the best location for royal palaces or tombs. Changdeokgung is considered one of the finest locations of any building in Korea.  Changdeokgung encapsilates this philosphy better than any other Korean palace, and this is one reason it is a Unesco World Heritage site. For 288 years Changdeokgung was the primary palace of the very long ruling Joseon dynasty. Kings were born, numerous royal weddings took place, and royalty died in this palace complex. Kings wrote poetry in the secret garden, one famous poem is etched in stone here.  It is true some parts of the palace have been rebuilt after Korea's tumultous history during the 20th century, but there are numerous structures that are very well preserved. Geumcheongyo Bridge is the oldest bridge in Seoul and dates back to 1411. The oldest wooden buildings are from the 17th century, as the palace was burned to the ground in the Imjin War. Injeongjeon Hall, the most grand building of the palace was last rebuilt in 1804.  The secret garden is the most celebrated of all Korean gardens, in which harmony with nature is of primary importance. Much of the trees in the garden are over 300 years old, some planted by royalty. It should also be noted that IUCN designated the secret garden as a conservation area because of its diverse ecosystem and landscape, despite being in central Seoul.  I have taken 5 tours of Changdeokgung palace, all of them different. It is one of the most important historical sites related with the Joseon dynasty. If history is not your thing, at the very least you can enjoy the beautful garden and imagine a different age.",267,much
268,268,2622,"I only visited this palace because I had extra time in Seoul and had half a day to spend on this palace, Insa-dong, and the Buchon villiage. Do not expect a grand palace as Gyeongbokgung. If you want to visit, come for the history not for the sight.  Unlike Gyeongbokgung which is connected to the subway station, the Changaokgung is a bit of a walk from the subway station. Just when I thought I missed it, there it was. This palace does not boast a large foot print and does not have as many grand structures as Gyeongbokgung. There is no guards nor ceramoney. There is not much to see really. The english tour is only about $3 and the guide tried her best and made the palace tour more interesting than it was.  There is a secret garden behind the palace, which occupies most of the land and requires a seperate entrance which I will described below. The tour costs $5 and the tour guide also did a great job. However, the garden is similar to our community garden back home, with a few traditional Korean structures scattered around. It is a hilly garden and not the best for the physically challenged.  If anyone is planning on a day tour to cover this palace, the secret garden, Insa-dong, and the village, one needs to be fit. If you are like me who only hikes 2-5 miles a day, I recommend skipping the secret garden (or the Changdaekgung all together) and use your time and energy for other things more exciting in Seoul, which are plentiful. You can read about the history of Changdaekgung without spending precious time here.",268,much
269,269,2634,"Good to read up first and focus on the chambers that you intend to visit. A guided tour would be good to explain in details. Wonderful experience to witness the change-of-guard possession. Take it easy, savour the rich culture, close your eyes and envision the time the Officers were standing according to their ranks. I did not walk around too much but the ancient buildings, vastness, how sommers were being kept cool (by lifting doors in hanging horizontal positions) were a marvel.",269,much
270,270,2637,"If you're palace hopping in Seoul, this one is highly recommended -- there are quite a few buildings to check out, regular English tours of the buildings and the Secret Garden, and plenty of spots for interesting pictures. You can check out the buildings unguided, and that would take up less than an hour (depending on how short your attention span is). I didn't get a guide and that's probably why I left thinking it was a pretty place but without much insight on the history (brochure was pretty thin and mostly served as a map).  Re Secret Garden, when choosing an exit option, the ""never before trodden"" one is okay -- they say it's hilly and long but it didn't feel like it was more difficult to walk that way than the ""retracing your steps to the entrance of the garden"" route. Budget 1.5 hours for the Secret Garden if you're guided (in certain seasons, you can wander about unguided). English tourists on the 11:30 run -- bring a sandwich and a drink! It's a huge garden, and you can't get lunch inside.  While there, see the Bukchon houses and Insadong -- these top tourist spots are all near the Anguk Station.",270,much
271,271,2641,"Apart from the size, I'm not impress with this palace much. The style are similar to other palace in Seoul. It's also very crowded, so full of people rushing to follow tour guides.",271,much
272,272,2644,"The palace itself is average. You cannot go inside any of the buildings, but the grounds are well kept and the exteriors are well renovated. The guided tours are awful, so don't waste your time. The guides rush from location to location and begin speaking as soon as they reach the next spot, but before the majority of the travelers have caught up. Even with a microphone, we could not hear what one of our guide was saying she spoke so softly. The groups, especially for the Huwon, are massive, so that also makes it challenging to keep up and hear your tour. Also, the guides dictate, verbatim, what is in the pamphlet they hand you when you buy your tickets, so you could easily have a much more enjoyable self-guided tour on your own schedule. While we were able to tour the Huwon on our own, I do believe for the most part, you are required to be with a guide. The Huwon was beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there photographing it. Do not expect your typical floral garden- there are very few flowers in the Huwon, which our friends were disappointed to discover. The garden features nicely maintained buildings, some small ponds and lots of greenery on well shaded pathways. The Huwon is a great stop in Korea.",272,much
273,273,2645,The others were much more pleasing to the eye. Still important part of Korean history.,273,much
274,274,2648,This palace certainly has a lot to explore. But you do not need to know the history because the buildings are magnificent without knowing the history.  There are a number of buildings to work around and a plethora of things to learn - if you are interested take a guide from the front and work slowly round each building.  The gardens look wonderful but we spent so much time wandering through the buildings that we ran out of time to investigate the 'Secret Gardens'.,274,much
275,275,2649,"The size of the palace is impressive, and if you take into account that the secret gardens are also part of it, you will definitely have things to see for a couple of hours. We did not visit the secret garden, because the reviews said that it's not the typical garden full of flowers. And we thought that we pretty much saw the korean style garden around the palace itself. However we also visited the Changgyeong palace, which you can get to from inside this palace (entrance next to the meeting point for the secret garden). From there we headed to the Jongmyo shrine, which was about a 15 minute walk. Besides its size, I personally didn't find anything outstanding about this palace. I have seen other asian palaces which were much more adorned - I honestly expected more design (inside and outside) that what it actually had. However the buildings are well maintained and the surrounding area / park is clean. The place is very dusty, so by the end of your visit you will most likely have to clean your shoes.",275,much
276,276,2651,"There are about 5 palaces around Seoul. Read up on them, pick carefully, and go to some, BUT NOT ALL as much is replicated. For a deeper insight into them, take a guided tour at one, but no more.",276,much
277,277,2661,"We very much enjoyed our visit to Changdeokgung Palace but more so our guided Secret Garden tour. We used the handbook that was given to us at the ticket office to self guide our way around the Palace, we probably only spent one hour wandering around before our secret garden tour. On the day of our visit there would have been around 50 people in our tour, the guide managed the number very well, waiting in most instances for everyone to catch up when walking from one site to another.  The tour lasts 1 hour and 40 minute, apparently Autumn is the best time of year to visit per the guide, but we very much enjoyed what nature had on offer, the cherry blossoms were out, and that's a nice thing. The secret garden was built for the sole use of the royal family in Joseon Dynasty, even today it is a peaceful place in a busy city. The water features are not as stunning as they would have been in the 1400s when they were designed, due to the growth of the city, so one can only imagine what is was like back then. There is a lot of walking on the tour, some steep hills and stairs to navigate, it is surprising how unfit most people were in our tour, young and old, and they would lag behind, but the tour seems to accommodate this.  As we were staying in downtown Seoul we were able to walk from our hotel to the Palace. I had reserved our places for the tour online the night before, but never needed to show my reservation number at the ticket office as they were plenty of tickets available on the day.",277,much
278,278,2670,"We visited this palace and enjoyed it. However, don't expect to see much, as it's a replica (most burned either during the 1910 occupation, WWII or the Korean war) and there is literally no furniture par a bed and a throne to see. The gardens are probably the biggest asset. We didn't visit those as you need to follow a guided tour and that didn't fit our schedule.",278,much
279,279,2674,"A visit here will make for a pleasant hour or two of your day. There's not much to see except for lovely old buildings and gardens, so it's not mentally exhausting like a museum -- more like a walk in a World Heritage park.  Tours of the Palace and Secret Garden are offered in English at 11:30 and 14:30 (closed Mondays). There are tours offered in other languages at different times, but I'm sorry I can't remember them all. You must be on a tour to enter the Secret Garden, but you don't need it for the Palace. If you choose not to take a tour of the Palace grounds, make sure you grab one of the little green information booklets (free) from the entrance gate, as there isn't much signage to tell you what you're looking at.",279,much
280,280,2687,"If you are debating which palace to go to (because there are just so many in Seoul), this one is the best to see in Spring because of its beautiful gardens. Make sure you go earlier in the day if you go because sometimes the garden tours close pretty early. I would say however that the garden tour isn't much to see in summer (there aren't any real colors...just lots of trees). I have gone to the palaces every season except winter and spring is best for the garden but fall could come in a very close seconds. It's all personal preference. This palace also ""connects"" to another palace area so you could wipe out two birds with one stone by going to see this one instead.",280,much
281,281,2693,"We visited early in the morning, not knowing the tour schedules. I remember enjoying the early morning walk with the chilly autumn air and the misty almost empty streets until we came to the gate of the palace, which I thought was*the* palace at first since it was so large.  We spent about an hour touring the place by ourselves and mingled with the other tourists reading the brochures and the markers until it was finally time for the English guided tour at 10.30 a.m.  There were actually many tourists around, most of them I think were Japanese or Korean, but the place was so large that the compound never felt full, it seemed rather empty even!  We were glad we joined the guided tour. There are much more fascinating facts to be learned about the buildings and the comings and goings of the Joseon dynasty members that we didn't find out just by reading the brochure or palace markers.  We didn't get to visit all the palaces in Seoul, but we were definitely glad we visited this one. Truly a beautiful and historical site.  If you are going there, wear comfortable shoes and prepare to walk a lot. The compound is big and will take about two hours worth of walking to explore sufficiently (not fully, I think you'd need a day or two for that). And don't miss the tour of the Secret Garden near the back area of the palace! This requires a separate entrance fee and has a different tour schedule.",281,much
282,282,2696,"The location of the palace is very easy to get to: you can either take the Seoul City tour bus and stop here, or you can take the metro and alight at the station (there are signs in the subway that will direct you to which exit is closest).  There's always a line outside so be mindful of the crowds. There's an entrance fee, and you can purchase a ticket from a booth located outside the main gates. You can also opt for an English tour, which only goes for certain times in the day (we chose the 11 am slot). The tour doesn't start on time because the guide wants to get as much of the English-speaking people together as possible (there was only one person doing the tour for about 20 people). This particular tour goes on for around two hours and only covers the palace grounds; you'll have to purchase another ticket for the Secret Garden tour, which only goes in the afternoon (in my case it had been around 2 pm).  Because we were so many, it was hard to hear the guide speak. She was dressed in a bright and colorful Hanbok (I think so it's easier for us to spot her) and brought around a small microphone but we still strained to hear what she was talking about. She also had a folder with pictures of things so we had a visual of stuff she talked about. You can ask her questions if you misheard something or would like to learn more, but I recommend you do this aside so it doesn't prolong everyone. It's very scripted and impersonal. In every station she allots a few minutes so you can take pictures or explore the area on your own before moving on. As I mentioned earlier, this was just a tour of the main palace, so she took us to the sleeping quarters, the library, the ritual house, the kitchens, the receiving area, the bridge, etc. On the day that we went it wasn't crowded so we were able to take photos without random people in it.  The tour of the Secret Garden was the highlight of this experience. You buy a separate ticket and can opt for the English tour as well, but others just choose to walk the course by themselves (which eventually you will do because the place will absorb you). The grounds are MASSIVE. The emperor had it right having a whole freaking park as his backyard. He and the crown prince had their own libraries, and plenty of pavilions that allowed you a view of, say, the lake from different angles. The buildings are pretty far from each other (you will mostly just walk) because they go with the natural flow of the mountain. Our tour guide (dressed in the same bright Hanbok and armed with the same tiny mic) was a little scary because she looked like she was having a bad day. She wasn't very open to questions and those she did answer she returned with monosyllables and a glare. Her pace is just right, allowing maybe 7 minutes per station (including photo-taking), and she keeps reminding you that you can go off by yourself and never get lost as long as you follow the paved path. I should mention that before you start the tour, you should head to the bathroom because there are no others in the area save for the one at the souvenir shop near the entrance. You should also bring an umbrella along during their rainy season, because chances are it WILL rain and there is nowhere you can seek shelter. Also bring a water bottle because it is a long walk and you may get thirsty along the way.

283,283,2704,"Seoul was made the capital city of Korea over six centuries back by the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). It was the last Dynasty to rule Korea before that country was taken over by Japan. Korea became independent again only after Japan's defeat in World War II - only to be divided between the democratic South and the Communist North. Today, The South is a showpiece liberal democracy, while the North has the most repressive regime anywhere.  The Gyeongbokgung Palace (gung means palace) is the oldest and largest palace to be built by that dynasty, with the huge main building having an imposing Korean-style double roof. Visitors can have themselves pictured with the ""Royal Guards"", dressed in colourful peroid costumes, and carrying weapons of their times. On my last day in Seoul, I was fortunate to witness a detailed religious ceremony featuring numerous priests, singers and dancers, all in colourful period costumes. It was living history at its best. (Admission Won 3,000, Tuesdays closed). On the palace grounds are the excellent National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum of Korea (entry free, closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, respectively).  The Changdeokgung Palace, set up later, became the favourite residence of later Joseon Dynasty Kings, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It has numerous wooden buildings, esthetically painted, and displaying an understated elegance. Korean palaces are very different from the ostentatious palaces of Western Europe. The attached Huwon Garden is a beautiful example of Joseon-period garden architecture. The King and his people would stroll around the lotus pond and even discuss matters of state there. (Admission Won 3,000, closed on Mondays. Tour of garden Won 5,000 more)..  Right next to it is the smaller Changgyeonggung Palace, built as the residence of three dowager Queens. It is also worth a visit. The Deoksugung and Gyeonghuigung Palaces are much smaller still, and less important.  Tourists should preferably visit only the first two palaces mentioned above, and the Jongmyo Shrine - the Royal ancestrial shrine of the Joseon Dynasty, located nearby..  Seoul is so rich in historical and cultural attractions, world-class museums and art galleries, and classical music and dance performances, that my ten-day itinerary was inadequate to cover even half of it.

It wasn't really that old, as many buildings were rebuilt many times. The buildings had nothing inside, so they seemed just like empty shells. Much of the ground was just gravel, thus lifeless. Finally, there were only general descriptions of a couple areas, not descriptions for each building. Basically, there was no narrative to the entire place. If compared to similar buildings in China, there is no comparison. Even though the buildings in China are usually tourist traps, they tell you a story. For me that is important  One thing I can say about the place is that it is really cheap. My wife and I paid 6,000 won to get into both of the eastern palaces. That's basically six US dollars.

I was looking forward to the tour with great anticipation, as it is only offered to foreigners six nights a year, with a limit of 100 tickets per night. I made a special point to be online and order tickets the minute they went on sale, that's how much I wanted to take this tour.  The tour was offered in English, Chinese, and Japanese, and attendees were divided into groups accordingly. That part was good. I expected the pathways, buildings and garden to be illuminated (not brightly so as to recreate daytime, but at least so that we could see what we were being shown) but sadly, this was not the case. A small number of attendees were asked to carry paper lanterns as we walked the grounds, and there were a few lights on the buildings, but I couldn't really see much. The pathways were unlit (the few paper lanterns scattered about were ineffective), and the ground is quite uneven, with random obstacles on the path (something which looked like pipe vents, at one point there was something that looked like an empty concrete pond, completely unlit, which someone could easily have tripped into), and we were marched from building to building very quickly. There was a lot of hiking up stairs and then down stairs, all stone, all uneven, all unlit. What could have been a pleasant walking tour felt more like a march in the dark. We were ""treated"" to a tour of the rear ""secret"" garden but were unable to see anything - I mean absolutely nothing. So what was the point of taking us through the garden? I'm still not sure.  When we reached the pavilion at the end of the garden, there was one building which was beautifully lit, with a large (unlit) pond in front of it. A musician played a traditional Korean gayageum, and we got to sit and listen for about 10 minutes. This part of the tour was quite lovely.  Tea and traditional Korean sweets were part of the tour, but the tea was served in paper cups - take one as you walk past a table, and keep moving - and the sweets were handed to you in a (very nice) fabric bag. I didn't expect a formal tea ceremony, but I also didn't expect a paper cup. This was just one more disappointment.  From there we sat as an audience in front of a stage area, where we were treated to another lovely musical performance consisting of several different types of performances. This was the highlight of the tour. If this had not been included, my rating would have been ""poor"" rather than ""average."" After that, we had to walk about 15 minutes back to the entrance, with no guidance, minimal lighting, and, once again, hidden obstacles.  Cost: 30,000 won per person. I would not recommend it.

There were also destruction from fires and such. Still, they are indeed very beautiful and will give you a good sense of Korean culture, art, and history.

339,1,183,"We visited this place with two children. It is beautiful place and lots to see Highly recommend. Give enough time . Lots of walking . We took English speaking guide, Bit disappointed as she spoke very fast and did not allow group together to catch up. Go early as not to miss changing of guard and visit to Gardens.   .",339,disappointed
340,2,251,I think my expectation was way too high and the day I visited was a cold day without much sun. That's why I was little disappointed and it would have been so much better if the day was warmer and brighter.,340,disappointed
341,3,257,"It’s unclear what, if anything, is the original structure. It has been reconstructed with bits from another palace which makes it all seem a bit pointless, especially since they point out that many structures were modified in the process. Is this really what the palace looked like? And what parts are original, from the other palace, or new from the restoration which began in the 1990’s?  You can’t go into any of the ”historical” buildings (from the 1990’s..?) which means you only see exteriors and the occasional glance through and open window or door.  There is very little written information in English (or any other language for that matter). To enter the garden you have to join the English speaking guided tour which only runs 3-4 times a day, and since it’s a limited number of people per tour, chances are likely that you won’t get tickets unless you booked in advance. Although I can’t say I’m terribly disappointed in not getting a spot for the garden since I wasn’t very impressed with the palace to begin with.  I wouldn’t recommend this one.",341,disappointed
342,4,511,"The palace is nice, less crowded than Gyeongbokgung and a bit smaller, so I liked this one more. But the main reason I came here was the Secret Garden tour and we were not disappointed. The tour itself provides valuable information for those interested in the history of the place. I stayed back for the first few buildings, then decided to explore on my own, since I wanted to get nice pictures without the whole group in them (the tour is limited to 100 people). I would recommend that. You can always go back and catch up with the group, or ask the guide some questions. The gardens are so beautiful, we were lucky with the weather; sunshine and blue sky. It was just amazing and I took a million pictures (see below :-)), a total MUST DO if you love gardens. I would go back and book the tour again, it's so beautiful!",342,disappointed
343,5,715,"First of all, palaces in Seoul aren't something spectacular nor in fantastic sceneries. That's not what they pursued in the past. Gates might be the biggest structures. And maybe some temples on mountains or on cliffs will be better for wallpapers. Tourists expecting those might be disappointed after visits. Nevertheless, there are people who have been so impressed on them and Changdeokgung is one of the best.  - location: Locating in a less crowded area and with less reputation than Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung is comparatively quieter and more comfortable to take a look. Gwangjang Market, Jongmyo Shrine and Changgyeonggung Palace are near and good for connected package in a single day.  - The true beauty of Korea's palaces is a harmony with surrounding nature. Trees, rocks and even views around are parts of the palace. Sophisticated roofs of buildings are also nice.  - The tour is walking outside and watching. The good weather is very important.  - There aren't many buildings and visitors can't enter inside.  - Guided tours only during weekdays. Free visit on Saturday. I think slow travelers will prefer visiting on Saturday.  - Secret Garden: Called as Huwon(後苑 Backyard Garden) or Biwon(秘院 Secret Garden) in the history. 5,000 won to have a guided tour. This takes about 90 min and there are several buildings and pavilions in the forest. The old tree near the way out shouldn't be missed. Right next to the entrance of Huwon, there's the entrance of the other palace, Changgyeonggung.  - The gift shop has tons of quality gifts comparing to most other folk shops in Seoul. Prices are high as they need to be.  - Events like night specials will be also nice. They have illuminations and great performances.",343,disappointed

345,7,743,"I read about a Moonlight guided tour of this palace from 8 PM - 10 PM on Sunday nights from June 2017 - November 2017, so I jumped on the opportunity and booked the ticket 3 months in advance of my trip. I was not disappointed - this palace is seriously SO beautiful. Between Gyeonbokgung (the large main palace in Seoul at the city center) and this palace, I MUCH preferred Changdeokgung. The guided tour at night was great, and had an English speaking guide (they offer Korean, English, and Chinese). We went through the palace and learned about the different buildings and architecture. The secret garden is only open to moonlight tour guests and we got to see that too - it was absolutely stunning with the library lit up in the background over the pond. There were traditional musicians throughout the palace as well, playing the traditional flute, and someone was playing a gayageum in the garden. After the actual tour, there was also a cultural performance, where we saw two traditional Korean dances, heard a traditional music performance by a Korean ensemble, and heard one of the traditional Korean stories that are sung by the storyteller. We got to try special tea and foods as well, and got a little gift of 6 gold bookmarks with Changdeokgung's special window architecture on them. Overall, for 32,000 Won (~$30) I would highly recommend that people get tickets to this event, or if not at least go see the palace sometime during the day. I'm not sure what the regular day admission is for the palace, but I'm sure it's less than the moonlight tour. Maybe about 10,000 Won (~$10)? But I'm not totally sure.",345,disappointed
346,8,877,"went there specifically for the renowned Secret Garden sights end of March, the cherry blossom season. You gotta pay extra for this Secret Garden guided tour, as they wont let you in by yourself. otherwise you just pay for the general admission fee. Seem wearing a Hanbok will get you some discount on the entrance fee. the old heritage building is well maintained and upon entering we were greeted by 2 blooming white cherry blossom tree. there were a few more pink cherry blossom further in. as for the Secret Garden tour, very informative tour guide and very friendly. there are different language tour session, so know when is preferred time slots. Was a disappointed though with the scenery as the flowers are not in bloom and the trees are still withered from winter. Be prepared for a little up slope hike. Really choose your visiting season well or else be disappointed.

348,10,1224,Went there with my wife and son especially to see secret garden. Gosh!!! What a waste of time. Nothing to see in that garden. Mughal gardens in india are much better. Took free English tour. Felt walking in a normal garden. But totally disappointed. Guide used to show a simple hut with no great architecture and give its history. I got to know that I am doomed when they told that the 1st place we will visit iin the garden is the most beautiful place. A big no from my side.,348,disappointed

You are truly in an oasis in the middle of the beautiful city of Seoul.",349,disappointed
350,12,1366,"While not the biggest palace- this is probably the most visited of the 5 palaces in Seoul. While the biggest palace- Gyeong-bok-gung (Gung means palace), Chang-deok-gung was the most preferred palace of the king and his queens, chiefly for one reason- the SECRET GARDEN, which covers ~60% of the total palace area. While the palace itself can be entered with a ticket of KRW 3,000 and without a guide, the secret garden has a separate entrance within the palace (and ticket) and can only be accessed with a guide. Each guided tour lasts 90 minutes and tours are run in English and Korean languages (there might be other languages, but am sorry not sure about which ones, maybe Chinese & Japanese as well). The palace itself is open from 9AM to 5PM on all days (Mondays closed).  Another important piece of advice- each tour has a cap of 100 joiners and while there are 3-4 English and 4 Korean tours every day (except Mondays) and they sell our pretty fast; apparently 50 passes per tour can also be booked online, though I haven’t tried it personally. So unless you are staying for a few days and want to try your luck, try booking the pass in advance. A palace-cum-garden ticket can be obtained at the main entrance for KRW 8,000.  I actually missed the Sunday 3:30 PM (last English tour) and was almost disappointed until I came out and realised that there were 2 Korean tours available for 4 PM and 4:30 PM (ending at 5:30 and 6 PM, even though main gates shut at 5 for new entrants). As it was the last free day I had in Seoul I joined the Korean tour, which was the second best option. Really enjoyed the stunning beauty and grandeur of the secret garden, complete with small ponds with large umbrella-esque shelters for the royalty to sit by, waterfalls, and beautiful halls inside, not to mention flower beds and courtyards. And, the Korean guide realised that I had missed the English tour and was kind enough to summarise the brief to me after others had been informed and given time to click pictures.  A must-do in Seoul, apart from Gyeong-bok-gung (for the Change of Guard ceremony at 10 AM & 2 PM daily except Tuesdays when it is closed).",350,disappointed
351,13,1479,"To really appreciate Korean culture, I wanted to visit this amazing palace and immerse myself in the ornate beauty. I was not disappointed. The guards are dressed in ancient style finery and allow you to have pictures taken with them. Inside, you walk through one palace to another and can take photos of the interiors, which are dazzling. It's especially nice to do this on a day with good weather as it requires quite a lot of walking outdoors.",351,disappointed

I was disappointed that you could not enter any of the buildings however there was information in English almost everywhere. Staff were helpful and polite. There are toilets a a cafe should you need them. We did not enter the second area as you could only do so on a guided tour and this lasted 90 minutes. It was too cold for us to stand around!",352,disappointed
353,15,1569,"We visited Changdeokgung Palace on two separate visits while in Seoul recently. During our first visit, we took the guided tour of the ""Secret Garden"". We had made a reservation several days in advance since the English language tour only allows for a certain number of people at a time. Our guide was exceptional. She was very knowledgeable; spoke excellent English; and you could engage her in conversation in between the various stops along the way. This was wonderful as I always want to learn more about the places I visit. I would rate the guided tour we had of the ""Secret Garden"" as the BEST thing we did during our time in Seoul. On our second day, we brought members of our family to the Changdeokgung Palace. We did not take a guided tour. There were signs along the way in English that explained each of the areas of the palace that we saw. They were very well done. Having seen the Gyeongbokgung Palace on a previous visit to Seoul, I would rate the ""Chang"" palace as being more interesting. Why? First, it's in a great setting - on a hillside with woods surrounding it. Second, it is more compact and therefore more manageable to get around to the various buildings. Third, it has the most original buildings of the two palace compounds. That's why it has been chosen as an UNESCO World Heritage site. We really enjoyed walking around Changdeokgung Palace on what was a cold November day. The gift shop was a great place to warm up when we needed to. Consider adding this palace to your list of 'must-sees' in Seoul. You will not be disappointed!",353,disappointed
354,16,1607,"Just a word of caution: The tour is physically challenging and, at times, arduous (with some steep climbs and descents, frequently on uneven ground and/or stones). Unless you are in good physical and aerobic shape, save yourself 5,000 won and give it a pass.  The guide for my group had full command of English, was cool and laid back, was thorough yet concise and, most importantly, went at a fairly leisurely pace. This allowed people to admire the sights, fall back a bit to photograph along the way and rest a bit, as the tour is physically demanding. [If anyone affiliated with the Imperial Household Agency in Kyoto reads this: You might want to take this tour to see how you should be conducting yours... seriously].  The walk is pleasant, the sights are pleasant. I was a little disappointed that the structural highlight of the tour, Juhamnu Pavilion, was “view at a distance” only. Additionally, I was a little surprised that the structures and grounds of many of the sights were not kept up as one would expect, given the garden’s significance. One of the sights (I believe it was Seonhyangjae) was under complete renovation; while that was bad for us, it will be good for those who visit when it’s completed.  The tour was vastly more valuable from a historical viewpoint than was from a visual standpoint. A Japanese garden it was not. I’m sure in the autumn it will be more visually compelling. This is a subjective opinion but I’m very torn as to whether or not it paid for itself (obviously they have to pay the tour guides which adds to their cost though, so therein lies the bind).  One thing the tour is, though, and that’s shady. If it’s uncomfortably warm or hot, you might want to schedule the tour to coincide with the height of the mid-day sun (although the strenuousness of some of the climbs sort-of negates the inherent temperature differential).",354,disappointed
355,17,1756,"Changdeokgung Palace was close to our hotel. The entrance cost 3000 KW for Palace itself and Palace Garden had a separate price. If you have been to China and other Asia you would be probably disappointed, so was I. The Palace looks like Chinese but cheap, it is small and low like few other things in Korea. Blooming trees were really beautiful over there. But in general it was not a Palace but traditional mansion.",355,disappointed
356,18,1785,"This palace is on the World Heritage List and deserves to be. If you only see one palace in Seoul, make sure it is Changdeokgung. This palace eschews the rigid, identical layout of the other palaces and has more character to it thanks to the lovely gardens and more of the rooms having furniture in them. I took the free English guided tour of the palace and learnt lots about how the palace was used and who lived there. The Secret Garden tour was also enjoyable, seeing all the little ponds and pavilions tucked away in the extensive, forested grounds that feel a world away from the modern city around you. I was disappointed by the other palaces of Seoul, but Changdeokdung is something special and a nice place to visit.",356,disappointed

We made ticket reservation on its website 1-week before the trip, all Chinese & English speaking tour guides were fully booked, we Chinese only had to book a ""Japanese"" speaking tour guide at 12:30 pm. If you want to know every place of its history, it is highly recommended to make the reservation on its official website as early as possible for a understandable language. No advance payment is required.  Upon arrival at the Secret Garden, we were a bit disappointed because it's too early for the beautiful Autumn leaves at the end of October, not much were seen. However, the weather is nice and comfortable, it took us 2.5 - 3 hours to walk, take pictures and enjoy the environment (without following the Japanese tour guide). It is a nice & relaxing place to visit. We may learn more of Its history on its official website or UNESCO's.",359,disappointed
360,22,2197,This is the best preserved palace in Seoul so the guide books tell us. We were a little disappointed. We went on an English tour. Our guide spoke very good English but she started her commentary to quickly. There were many places where the group had to move in single file and with the best will in the world it took time for the whole group to gather. In the meantime the guide had started her commentary when about 6 people ( out of a group of 20 or more) had arrived so we missed quite a bit.  Although the buildings were very interesting they were completely bare. It would have been good to see some of the rooms furnished appropriately. Another day I visited Unhyeongung Palace which is just down the road and although a lot smaller I found it more interesting because many of the rooms were furnished and even had mannequins of the royal family of the time in them.Tthis palace was free but we paid a modest amount at Chagdeokgung Palace.,360,disappointed

There was an extra entrance fee for the secret garden, which according to the guide books was the gem of this site. We didn't go in unfortunately. Strollers? Impossible to lug up the huge stone steps in front of every building. Families with young children need to be better prepared than we were.",361,disappointed
362,24,2242,"Such a beautiful place. This palace was recommended to us over a visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace as it's meant to be prettier. Obviously we went with this recommendation and whilst I can't compare, I can say that we were not disappointed. We made it in time to take the secret garden tour - the only way to see the gardens and the back of the palace, including the prince's private get-away and the servant quarters. The tour guide was was full of really interesting facts and it gave us insight into how Koreans lived in that era, eg. raised rooms that were cooler in Korea's stinking hot summer's. I really, really wish that the library was available on the tour, however we could only look up at it. The courtyard with the pond and the library is stunning. We could've stayed for ages, but we were so tired from walking around. Take some snacks as the shop there only had drinks!",362,disappointed
363,25,2277,"Having been to the Forbidden Palace in Beijing... nothing else could really compare, so I was a bit biased! This palace was very easy to find and easy to get to which was great. The inside was quite nice too, although it is mostly empty rooms... There wasnt that many visitors when I went so you could see everything and take decent pictures without a swarm of people in your photos. However, I was rather disappointed that they had 'sold out' of tickets for the secret garden! It was the main reason I went... I don't really know how tickets for a garden could sell out... anyway... so you've got to go super early to get tickets for that! I think I went around midday and there were no tickets left. Anyway, this is quite a nice place to go for history and photos. Theres a small coffee shop and souvenir shop inside.",363,disappointed

There is a Secret Garden inside the Palace, you need to buy another ticket for it, but I think the garden is not so interesting, compare to the imperial garden in China or Europe.

The guided tours are awful, so don't waste your time. The guides rush from location to location and begin speaking as soon as they reach the next spot, but before the majority of the travelers have caught up. Even with a microphone, we could not hear what one of our guide was saying she spoke so softly. The groups, especially for the Huwon, are massive, so that also makes it challenging to keep up and hear your tour. Also, the guides dictate, verbatim, what is in the pamphlet they hand you when you buy your tickets, so you could easily have a much more enjoyable self-guided tour on your own schedule. While we were able to tour the Huwon on our own, I do believe for the most part, you are required to be with a guide. The Huwon was beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there photographing it. Do not expect your typical floral garden- there are very few flowers in the Huwon, which our friends were disappointed to discover. The garden features nicely maintained buildings, some small ponds and lots of greenery on well shaded pathways. The Huwon is a great stop in Korea.",367,disappointed

So if you're expecting a beautiful English garden with lots of flowers, you may be disappointed.  There is a great FREE eponymous iPhone app for the palace. It serves as an audio guide and GPS map. Because of its size, it would be best to download it before going.",369,disappointed

Actually we were at the Changdeokgung Palace the day before but we were told we just missed the last English tour of the day. So on the 24th we only got to see the palace itself. If you are a foreigner it is assumed that you need an English tour. In the cold short winter days of December (may be even January and February), there were only two English tours in a day. It was at 11:30am and 2:30 pm. (It is worth double checking these times for yourself) We were not the only ones who were disappointed and had to go back a second time. (We were also made to pay the palace tour again) The palace itself was ok. In spite of the cold and the run around, the Biwon was worth it. In the palace compound proper one can still see the city buildings around. Once inside the garden it was a hidden world, and a very photogenic place. The idea is closer to a rambling Chinese garden with hills, ponds, gates, teahouses and pavilions than a controlled Japanese Zen meditation garden. Enjoy! The gift shop/Cafe carries good souvenirs but somewhat pricey. On the way out, west of the palace compound there are a few restaurants. For very delicious and very sizeable meat dumplings and oyster/fish pancakes, Buckchon Restaurant is highly recommended. (This place has tables and chairs) The service was also very good.",370,disappointed

Even so, it was an interesting visit and an opportunity to learn a few things about Korean history and culture. Sadly I did not make it to the secret garden, as I ran out of time, but this attraction is well worth a visit! A word of warning for people with physical impairments. There are some extremely steep steps to climb so don't be disappointed if you won't be able to see every part of it. Still, there should be plenty to make it worth your while.",371,disappointed

377,4,90,"Stunning palace. I have a lot of time in Seoul and Korea so going to see all the palaces. If your time is limited, definitely do this one. Time your visit accordingly with the mandatory guided tour of the Secret Garden. Annoyingly they appear to change timings so check online the day before your visit. I got there at 09:00 when they opened. I was the first person inside. I walked around the palace grounds myself for just over an hour and then did the English guided Secret Garden tour at 10:30 which finished around noon. Lasts about one and a half hours. You can leave the tour after fifty minutes as the last part is quite a bit of walking including uphill. For most of us it is fine but others were struggling with the heat even though it was early and parts of it are uphill so be mindful. I spent in total three hours there. Separate ticket for the palace and Secret Garden. They do have guided tours of the palace itself but to be honest, you can easily do this yourself. They give you a booklet plus there are information boards. Suggest going early as soon as it opens. It was beautiful and peaceful and you could freely walk around and enjoy the setting, also getting some good photographs. When I left at noon, it was much busier. Grounds are clean and well laid out. The palace was stunning. I loved the details of the doors and the architecture. There is a cafe and what appeared to be an art or souvenir shop on the premises. I didn't bother with it. Take water with especially if you are there for three hours like me. There are restrooms too. My thoughts. The Secret Garden is apparently the highlight. Whilst this was nice, I think the weather will contribute towards your experience. We had a lovely day and the sun shining with the reflection on the water and the colours of the leaves made the gardens look very pretty. However, we can't control the weather and I would suggest thinking about this if you have a day with bad weather. Parts of the garden were nice but other parts started to look the same. I started to get bored as did a lot of the group. I was glad I went though. The guide was difficult to understand (although the tour was in English) but there are information boards as well along the route which also provide useful facts. They limit the number of people on the tour so purchase a ticket as soon as you arrive.",377,much

379,6,108,"Set within a large park, accessible by subway, bus or tour, this Prospering Virtue Palace was built during the Joseon Dynasty. It served as the main palace for nearly 270 years following its destruction during the Japanese invasion and its subsequent rebuilding. A visitor may note that one building in particular, the Seonjeongjeon Hall is the only building featuring a tiled blue roof. There indeed is a love story to the history of this exquisite and beautiful palace, yet I shall leave that for the visitor to enjoy on their visit.  One detail in particular that distinguishes this palace from other palaces of the Joseon Dynasty is the palace gardens, and I am already planning my return trip to behold the “Quintessence of Joseon-era Landscaping” in spring or summer, to step where Kings and Queens strolled, relaxed, and perhaps engaged in sericulture. To truly savor visiting the Changdeokgung Palace I need to walk its gardens, valleys, pavilions and behold the lotus ponds and then see the Palace from otherwise hidden views. The Secret Garden occupies more than half of the entirety of Changdeokgung Palace, and I am delighted to plan my return to see the views from the Buyongji Pond and Juhamnu Pavilion, Aeryeonji Pond and Uiduhap, the New Seonwonjeon (New Royal Shrine) and so much more.  In the meantime I hope you enjoy my photographs of Changdeokgung Palace.  Please note that the admission to the Changdeokgung Palace is separate from the admission to the Secret Garden and, at least as of this writing, there is (but verify this) a Royal Palace Pass valid for 3 months from the purchase date, which includes admission to the Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden; the Gyeongbokgung Palace; the Changgyeonggung Palace; the Deoksugung Palace; and the Jongmyo Shrine.",379,much

You get to see the Throne Hall, with the impressive king's chair. Other than that, a lot was under repair, and you don't get to access the King's residence building, so not much to see. We didn't know how or if you could access the Queen's residence building (behind the King's residence building)... so overall, we didn't get to see much; however, the ones we saw were well preserved.",380,much
381,8,121,"Historically palace, if you wearing hanbok , you get to enter for free because Koreans care much about their traditions. Very impressed.",381,much
382,9,131,"Visited the palace first before Gyeongbokgung. Read reviews that this palace was designed to be in harmony with the environment and after arriving there, it can be observed as to how it is. For a Palace, it is certainly not imposing as the Gyeongbokgung one and certainly no surprise why many princes chose to have their palace here. Unfortunately, I did not follow any guided tour for the front part if the palace, thus may have missed much interesting snippets.  However the guided tour to the ""Secret Garden"" is a must. Only entered with a guided tour, they are conducted at different times for different languages. I say it's a must so when you visit, u can imagine how the palace designers have made much effort to be a environmentally harmonious building. Do make a point to visit it.",382,much
383,10,137,"A much often overlooked attraction compared to its more renowned 'sister' palace, the Gyeongbokgong.  The palace grounds are larger and the palace was used as a residence for the royal family back in the old days. Recommend to visit during the autumn due to sights of the structures complemented by the bright colors of the autumn foliage",383,much
384,11,144,This tour includes a guided tour of the palace grounds at night plus a performance at the end if the tour. We were served hot Korean tea in a disposable cup and given a goodie bag containing a purse and a bar of soap. It would have been nice if we were given some traditional Korean sweets instead of the soap. Try the moonlight tour if you want a different experience but do note the price is much higher than the day ticket.,384,much
385,12,152,I went to Changdeokgung Palace on a Sunday afternoon. It has less much people than Gyeongbokgung Palace. But I was not disappointed. I had opportunity to take many beautiful photos with interruption from other tourists. Don't expect grand buildings here as well as other palaces in Seoul. It offers a different kind of beauty and experience comparing to palaces in Beijing.,385,much
386,13,170,I hired the traditional “hanbok” dress to wear to the palace and get nice photos. This place is perfect for photos and the architecture and history is beautiful. Wearing the traditional dress made it more surreal and it really felt like you were there. It is a huge place so bring water and get as much photos as you can.,386,much
387,14,176,Very much enjoyed wandering around this UNESCO site. Now regret that we didn’t do the Secret Gardens but we were tiring.,387,much
388,15,192,"The palaces are beautiful and the grounds are well-landscaped. The original buildings were burned by the Japanese during their occupation of Korea, so these are recreations, but feel ancient. The guides at the library are very kind and helpful providing very interesting information. Take your time, there is a lot to see. It is also common to see people dressed in the garb of that time period which really adds to the atmosphere as you wander the grounds. There is so much history here. And if you are there in the summer, bring the sun umbrellas. It is hot and rain is frequent at that time of year. The little cafe has limited offerings, so you may want to bring food. Note of caution: If you take the Hop On Hop Off bus, they drop you off a quite a ways from the entrance. It is better to get off at the stop prior; it is much closer to the entrance.",388,much
389,16,193,Lovely place filled with history. There is so much to see. We did t have time to do the secret gardens. It was a very good visit.,389,much
390,17,210,"This is the most special of all the palaces and probably the one to visit in case you plan on doing one only. The palace is spacious with large open places. Tourists are not allowed inside much of the covered areas and most of the time you are out in the open. So it can be harsh during summers. But still if you are touring seoul this is one of the must do activities. Just be prepared for the walk and the sun. The secret garden tour is amazing and can only be taken as a guided tour of roughly 70 min duration in summers and 90 during other times. Most of cultural heritage sites including this palace in seoul are free to enter from Aug 10 -25, due to National Liberation Day celebrations...however secret garden tour is paid and needs to be booked atleast a day prior. There is a souvenir and refreshment shop inside for the tourists. From the inside one can also tour the Changgyeonggung palace since the two are connected. The entire tour including the palaces and secret garden can take from 2-3 hours.",390,much
391,18,227,"Absolutely magnificent palace complex. I spent about 5 hours wandering around the inner and outer court before exploring the palace itself and the secret gardens. I was mesmerised by it to be honest. I intended to spend a couple of hours, a half day at most, but ended up spending pretty much a whole day here. The gardens are extra, 5000 won, but are well worth it. The place is stunning obviously but don't rush through the inner and outer courtyards as they are just as enchanting. One of the best days I've had on tour in a long, longt ime and definitely the best and most beautiful attraction in Seoul. An absolute must-do in my opinion.",391,much
392,19,236,"I’d premise this with the fact it was an exceptionally hot and humid day we visited Changdeokgung palace which definitely impacted our enjoyment. The gardens are the main reason to visit and they are lovely (no flowers, all trees and greenery when we went in June - well maintained) but I would say beyond walking around the gardens, there wasn’t much to do. The entry price was only 1,000 won which is cheap but for that you can’t get inside any of the buildings and when it is hot, it’s a bit relentless.  So in short I’d recommend a short visit but not on a hot day.",392,much
393,20,244,"Following the Japanese Invasion both the first and main Gyeongbokgung Palace and this secondary palace were destroyed, but Changdeokgung Palace was rebuilt quickly and then became the main palace. This unique Korean palace was built in harmony with the landscape and is a true beauty. I did not go to the Secret Gardens though. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Walking thru both Palaces and the Bukchon Hanbok Village will take up much of your day so it's best to get an early start and then head to Insadong Street to browse and eat. These are some of the best sites to see in this section of Seoul.",393,much
394,21,251,I think my expectation was way too high and the day I visited was a cold day without much sun. That's why I was little disappointed and it would have been so much better if the day was warmer and brighter.,394,much
395,22,253,"The palace is very nice, but the garden is so much nicer. Lots of trees, so a nice place to visit on a hot day. Entering the garden is kinda weird. You have to buy a ticket for a specific time and only at that time you can enter the garden, even though the sign at the garden entrance says you can just go in on your own. You can choose to do a guided tour or walk around on your own.",395,much
396,23,258,Glad that we sign up for this moonlight tour. The atmosphere at night was so different from the day where it was much more peaceful except that it can be quite scary if you're walking alone. It's so beautiful at night walking around with a lantern on hand.  Get to see more of it and understand better from the guided tour despite having tour this place in the last trip.,396,much
397,24,293,This palace is one of the Joseon Dynasty king's favorite and it is much beautiful and calmer than Gyeongbokgung since it is near the secret garden. It is the only palace in Seoul that has granted UNESCO World Heritage.,397,much
398,25,320,"今年秋天終於排上日程，剛好可以參加古宮的夜間導覽。 ＊注意!外國人只有周日場次。我提前一個月上網買票，因為聽說很熱門，有時可能搶不到票。 前些年已經去過兩次昌德宮，但這是第一次夜間參觀，氣氛格外不同，安靜、神秘、美好。英文導覽員的英文很好，說得不多，但很清楚。記得一定要早點報到，因為是所有隊伍一齊在門外集合，等門開了才會魚貫進入。(自己腦補: 等待的時候有點像古代朝臣在宮門外等候上朝的那種感覺^^) 其實夜間能看到的古蹟特色比較少，畢竟天色已暗。但另有一股韻味(不透露太多，才能好好體會)。雖然收費較高，但包含一場很不錯的國樂與舞蹈等表演，還有小小點心盒。 *注意: 入秋後首爾日夜溫差大，整場tour都在戶外，若當天剛好遇上低溫冷鋒之類的，建議帽子、圍巾、手套都戴上。 *景福宮也有夜間參訪，買票時記得看清楚是景福宮(星光紀行)還是昌德宮(月光紀行)。兩者內容稍有不同，票價與時間長短也有差異。 I visited this palace twice before during daytime. This was my first Moonlight Tour to this ancient palace. It provided a different feel when walking in the quiet night. Open your ears and eyes, for there's music and performance. * This tour is only offered in a limited period ever spring and autumn. For foreigners, only Sunday nights are available, so plan your tour ahead if you're interested. * If you want to really see the beauty of architecture, visit during daytime -- it's really dark during this Moonlight Tour so you won't be able to see much palace features. * They would give you an earphone guide-set and a lantern to light your way. The English guide spoke good English. Note: The more famous palace -Gyeongbokgung- has a nighttime tour too, called Starlight Tour. There's some difference in the content of these two tours. In sum, this Tour is totally worthwhile, and it provides a unique experience. Keep warm, though, for temperatures could drop suddenly in spring/autumn nights in Seoul. Arrive early to check-in -- all visitors would lineup and wait for the gate to open and enter all-together. You can purchase online beforehand. The tickets could sometimes be sold out since this is a popular tour.",398,much
399,26,325,"Seoul has a few royal palaces. Changdeokgung was in use far into the 20th century. The thing with these palaces is; once you have seen one, you have pretty much seen them all. When you visit Seoul for the first time I certainly wouldn’t recommend to go see all palaces. One, two max, is more than enough. Changdeokgung is perfect for a quiet stroll on a lazy Sunday afternoon. From the back gate you can walk straight into Changgyeonggung palace. These two palaces are a haven of peace in busy Seoul.

The structure looks practically the same and there are so many small doors leading to small streets that you may get lost in it. But I like this one better than the gyeongbokgung, maybe because not so many people visiting it so not that crowded, you can really enjoy the scenery and imagine how the life’s like there when it’s still used by the royal family.",401,much

The scale is much smaller, but prettier I think. Many of the buildings here were open for display, so you can see what the rooms looked like. There are so many buildings and small paths to walk around here, you can get lost. I did not do the private gardens, I will keep that for next time. The entrance price was cheap and this palace was easy to get to. If you don't have time to visit all the palaces, I recommend visiting Changdeokgung Palace.",403,much

405,32,376,"though smaller than its main sister, the Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeok Palace can hold its own. In fact, I'd much prefer Changdeok due to its size (smaller palace ground) but no less beautiful and intricate. It also has Secret Garden palace (you need extra ticket to get in, famed for its beautiful ground and garden). With Changdeok, you got to see buildings and its functionality, its architecture and also history (progression). The colorful walls and ceilings are such a wonder, the neat design of the buildings are a marvel in itself. It's worth a visit for palace, architecture, and historical geek. You can definitely take great pictures in the compound, because there are many great spots to shoot.",405,much

No regret if you cannot enter the Secret Garden due to full booking in summer. Landscape and scenery are nothing special there. It was very humid in July when I went there. But I believe its scenery would be very beautiful when maples blossom in fall.  In general, the buildings of Changdeokgung Palace outside Secret Garden are much better than those in Gyeongbokgung Palace.",411,much
412,39,457,"My mother and I did a secret garden tool of the palace. It was not that great.  The tour was in Chinese since my mother only speaks chinese. It was a free tour offered by the park. The group was about 30 people with some family with young children and seniors.  The tourist guide was not good at all. Her Chinese was not clear, so most of the time we could not understand her. The garden itself is also not what we expected. It's not a botanic garden with flowers and plants, rather it's a big wooded area with natural trees on hills up and down. There were few residence halls here and there. So really not much to see. The guide walked very fast and never bother to check on anybody. It was like a hiking trip with climbing up and downs. The last draw was that the guide lead the group to an almost vertical up stairs in the bushes and just went up without asking anybody if they could do it. I would not risk my mother breakkng her leg gojng up there. So, with some other families with young children we had to look around to find another way out. It was totally unprofessional! We went to see other parts of the palace and didn't find the impressive. All the big halls have tall stairs to climb, so not easy for elderly.  I don't recommend the secret garden tool. Especially if you are not fit for hiking.",412,much

415,42,489,We walk here from City Hall where we were staying. The main entrance is now opened as I remember that it was under reconstruction then. There were guards doing sentry duties and they attracted much photo session. I was delighted to be granted free access being a 'Senior Citizen'. It's the usual visual to see how royalty live in the past. Lots of ground to cover as the site is huge. Highlight for me is to see a lot of folks wearing traditional Korean costume. And many were foreigners renting and wearing them. I said hello to a group of students from Indonesia dressed in the hanboks. I greet them in Bahasa which surprised them.,415,much
416,43,495,"I think if you visit Seoul, you have to go to one of the palaces. We went on a busy, sunny, weekend and it was very enjoyable. There's lots of places to walk around, and it's much different from the palaces and castles back home.  Rent a hanbok!!! There're loads of places nearby, very reasonably priced, and it makes the whole experience more fun. Also, free entry if you do so.  Whilst here we were approached by people (I want to say high school students?) who asked us to vote on things we liked about Korea. No idea why they were doing this, but it was fun to speak to new people. Also a lot of people taking pictures for each other.",416,much

There are very few building that are open, and most that are aren’t terribly ornate. You walk around and look at the exterior of the building with the doors all closed and all the mini complexes have the same architecture. It becomes rather repetitive. I don’t feel like you need to spend too much exploring every corner of the palace, hit the highlights and move on. The Folk Museum you can access for free is probably the best part, very informative on Korean culture. Keep you ticket stub for re entry to the palace grounds.",418,much

They sell separately for secret garden ticket and palace entrance ticket. for me its pretty good deal. I dont have to queue for bought entrance ticket for each palace I want to. Changdeokgung is massive palace, but maybe not as big as Gyeongbokgung. But in this palace there is a secret garden that can only be enter in certain time. and must be guided. it even got secured by 2 security personel. I got here only 2 hours before closed. So I didn't get much around the palace itself. We straight to secret garden entrace, and thank god the guide wasn't there yet. after the guide arrived we enter the secret garden. don't worry the guide was speaking english, also there is a chinese tour for certain time.  the guide told us that Secret Garden can only be enter by the king himself, other people can enter this side of the palace only by king permission.  so its truly a privileges for us to enter this secret garden. the garden is very much preservative and I can see why you can only enter in certain time and with personal guide.  Its like went inside another world, its not like seoul.. when you enter you can only feel peace. the air is different, even though the city just right upon you.  I just want to stay there as long as I could. But I could not because the guide only give us 10-15 minutes spare time for each site we visit. wear a nice and comfy shoes because the walk can take for 1-1,5 hours. and there quite few hills. my friend just went under surgeries last month and can't take the hills very well. security guard was nice and keeping her a company when we continue our tour.  for me if you visit seoul and have extra time. do visit this palace and secret garden for certain.",423,much

For example, it does offer a bit more history and authenticity as it is quite a bit older than the other palace which was only recently rebuilt.

They are similar in many ways - well-preserved, beautiful, with extensive grounds and many buildings to explore - but Changdeokgung has much larger grounds, which you can tour if you have a special ticket. When you first arrive, you can buy an entrance ticket to the palace, and at the same time can ask for an entry ticket to the ""Secret Garden."" This allows you entry at a specified time but doesn't cost anything extra. I've gone twice and once they just let us in at that time and we were free to wander at will. The second time, there was an English-speaking tour guide who showed us a few of the most important sights within the garden. It is amazing how quickly you feel immersed in nature, even though you know you are in the center of a bustling city. It is so quiet and serene - just the thing when city life gets too overwhelming. Definitely wear your walking shoes - the paths are smooth and wide, but the garden is very large and hilly so it requires a bit of stamina to see it all. Young children or anyone with limited mobility will find it tough to see the whole thing.",427,much

443,70,766,It is a very large area. Apart from the buildings there is not that much to see. The grounds are very serene and well kept.,443,much
444,71,778,Beautiful palace in the central of Seoul.... peaceful... Good for taking pictures. cheap entrance fees... not much crowded... mostly kids from school... 1 hour is enough to explore... been to all palace in Seoul... all looks similar... so its better to visit any 2 palace instead of visiting all palaces.,444,much
445,72,788,"Unimpressive palace that looks like a newly built movie set. The gardens are also boring and lacked imagination. Have seen much better and memorable historical sites at other Asian countries than this. e.g. Japan. If you don't have much time in Seoul, can skip this.",445,much
446,73,795,"This was the only palace I had time to tour while in Seoul, but I was grateful for the opportunity. There is so much symbolism to the architecture and furnishings that I would have been oblivious to without a guide. Also, learning how the multiple palaces in Seoul relate to each other was a fascinating lesson. This was an impressive visit!",446,much
447,74,816,"the secret garden stuff is amazing and enjoyable, but other than that everything is pretty much the same as gyeongbokgung, cultural palace. i do prefer the gyeongbokgung but the secret garden stuff is worth it.  and also less people wearing hanbok (other alternative to wear hanbok and take a picture of urself)",447,much
448,75,830,"I had a literal 24 hours in Seoul on a stopover and I was able to tour this beautiful palace with a local friend. The English tour was very informative and I learnt so much about what life would have been like at the palace throughout the ages! The architecture is gorgeous and the interior paintwork is like a mosaic of colour. I didn't have time to go into the secret garden, plus it was the middle of winter, but it was a lovely morning, well spent. They had a useful luggage storage locker facility, which was good as I was hauling at lot of gear.  I fully recommend visiting the palace if you are staying in Seoul, whether for a ridiculously short time like I was or for a longer time.",448,much
449,76,837,"I don't know too much about Korea but this palace compound was built in 1405 so it's well over 600 years old. Interesting to see this in the center of Seoul with all the traffic and other more modern buildings. To be honest, after visiting the Forbidden City in Beijing, any other Asian palace pales in comparison. It was still interesting to travel into Seoul to see it.",449,much
450,77,853,"There is much history here on these grounds! Changing of the guard was amazing and very colorful! The Korean Folk museum was very interesting to spend a few hours out of the hot sun! Beautiful gardens, ponds, and well manicured trees and shrubs! Fantastic background for professional looking photos!",450,much
451,78,863,"It was wonderful place especially in spring! I can see a Korean palace with beautiful sky in harmony. Actually I considered to visit Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung just befort a day of visit. But I'm sure Changdeokgung is better because I've heard several comments about Gyeonbokgung that there are too much people to enjoy that place. However Changdeokgung is good enough to enjoy the gung with nice weather, beautiful building and so on. And I recommend to use an application the ""Real, Changdeokgung"" which guides you based on your location. It is very helpful to tour Changdeokgung. Alwasy it's true that ""Your knowledge determines your insight."" At that point, it was awesome and to wonderful application to visit Changdeokgung.",451,much
452,79,870,"Changdoekgung is by far the best preserved palace in Seoul. While Gyeongbukgung is more famous, it has been altered more. I suggest you take the English speaking tour for your 1st visit, there are usually 2 or more a day. The tour takes you through the grounds and into a couple of the buildings, but more importantly takes you too the Hidden Gardens, ponds, and summer retreat palace buildings. Korean landscaping is much more natural than other gardens.  If you only have a couple days in Seoul, I put this high on the list of places to go. It is in central Seoul and close to Gyeongboekgung, Insadong, City Hall, Myeongdong, and Namdaenum.",452,much
453,80,875,The palace was only 10-15 minutes on foot from Anguk subway station. It might be the most beautiful one in Seoul. The cherry blossom was everywhere in the palace at the time we were visiting it. Walking around it might take less than an hour but we decided to slowly do so with resting and feeling the breeze of history blowing on us. So much enjoyful and peaceful!,453,much
454,81,888,"I appreciate Korean Palaces so much because it shows how much they treasure their history. It was well preserved and strictly kept clean, and thus it has become a highly respected place. I wish the Philippines valued its history as much as Koreans did. :(",454,much

I also went to the Secret Garden and did not enjoy it during March. Go there in the spring, summer or fall. Don't waste your time and money in the pre-spring season.",457,much
458,85,936,"This palace is much smaller than Gyeong Bok palace, but you will definately get a more out of this gem. Changdeok Palace has a garden that is only accesible through tour groups formed at the tocket booth. It is unnecessary to make reservaions if you are in a party under four, they offer walking tours in English, Chinese and Japanese. The royal garden is full of ancient trees, beautiful architecture and landscaping that is particular to the Korean culture, it is less tended and more close to a forest than a typical western garden. Don't hesitate to go on this tour as it is worth your money and time!",458,much
459,86,952,"This palace has much to explore, almost every corner has a magical photo opportunity! Especially with all the pretty girls wearing their traditional clothes. Many are more than happy to pose for you, if you ask nicely!

460,87,955,"You can't miss this place. Make sure you go there with lots of time (i would say at least 3hours) to explore the area. And please wear comfartable clothes and shoes because you will be walking a LOT. Paying for the guided tour is important for you to learn a lot the local history. Take time to choose a quiet spot, sit down and observe Korea people who goes there. You would be amazed how much you can learn by observing the way they interact with each other, how they respect their culture and people. I was truly amazed!!!",460,much
461,88,968,"We had an excellent afternoon including a secret garden tour. Without the tour I think it would be hard to enjoy or learn much during a visit, but the information and history provided by the guide during our 75 minute tour were really interesting and nice. Perhaps the group size was bigger than it should have been, but anyway it was a nice afternoon and without the tour it would have been a big disappointment.",461,much
462,89,986,"The palace could be more beautiful during fall, but I visited in winter so it looked the same with other palaces. We booked the huwon garden tour, and again, the tour guide said that the garden was much more beautiful during fall. In winter, it is all snow and frozen ponds. It was nice to hear the tour guide leading us through history, though.",462,much
463,90,997,"Highly recommended for a visit. This huge Palace complex is a fine example of Korean historical architecture and culture. The grounds were stunning, particularly in Autumn - it's a photograper's dream, particularly with the young local people dressed in traditional dress ( a lovely, popular current trend). Very reasonable entrance fee and so much to see there.",463,much
464,91,1006,This palace is neat to look around...not much on display but the area is nice with some fantastic scenery. Whilst there we learned that it is in the process if being rebuilt and so not much of it at all is actually historic.,464,much

466,93,1018,"Tip: You can book the secret garden tour a week in advance (I suggest you do so as it's limited to 100 per slot). The English tour starts at 11.30am.  Be at the palace early to roam around and join the 10.30 General Tour (English) around the palace grounds. You will still make it for the 11.30am secret garden tour which takes 1.5 hours.  Following the tours make it so much easier to appreciate and understand the stories behind the buildings. You can either choose to get off Jongno 3 ga station (exit 6) or Anguk station (exit 3) depending on where you stay.  We got the Royal Palace Pass which is 10,000 won and allows us entry to 4 palaces (including Gyeongbokgung) and the Jongmyo Royal Shrine.",466,much

469,96,1049,"We bought tickets for this palace along with tickets for the secret garden tour. Unfortunately, the tour guide for the secret garden had somewhat stilted English (and was thus a bit difficult to understand) and the tour was quite boring, so we just ventured out on our own after a while.  The palace is humongous so be prepared for a very long walk. Also note there really isn't much food you can purchase within the palace itself except for some drinks, so be prepared for that as well.  The palace does get a bit repetitive at times, although the nicely manicured grounds do make up for it.",469,much
470,97,1060,"So much into Korean royalty history. So interesting to see the King's palace and the Queen's palace, how they rule and what their restrictions are. The architecture and very detailed designs of the palace are impressive. They have maintained these sites so well without altering the original set-up. When you're in Seoul, at least visit one of these heritage sites. This requires lots of walking and climbing of stairs. You need need to be fit though but good walking tour.",470,much
471,98,1067,"Very attractive palace buildings with interesting architecture and interiors making a pleasant change from temple visiting. But don't expect to have the place to yourself. It was very busy, but this added to the character as many were in national costumes. Due to time restraints we were not able to visit the secret garden, which is a shame as photos we have seen make it look well worth visiting too. Would recommend having a local guide to make the most of your visit as there is much to understand.",471,much
472,99,1084,Part of the tour was a visit to Changdeokung Palace. Its design is not as detailed and intricate as that of Gyeongbokgung. It is much simpler and there were few people who visited this palace. Considered as Changdeokgung Palace was recognized as a World Cultural Heritage site by the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Committee.,472,much
473,100,1103,"We went to Seoul in June, it was quite hot, I had high expectations about Seoul but so far it was just an average trip that didn't have much attraction. We went to Changdeokgung Palace. I like places with history and story attached to it. I enjoyed the food but didn't love it. I guess enjoying/loving your travel will depend on the places that you go. So maybe next time I will try the outskirts of Seoul.",473,much
474,101,1106,Changdeokgung is a popular tourist spot. Its Secret Garden is hotly sought after in autumn; booking of entry for the Secret Garden of Changdeokgung is via internet (6 days in advance) and all the places will be taken up within an hour or so (booking starting at 10:00 local time). Changdeokgung itself is quite typical but the Secret Garden looks more ancient and has retained much of the original character (despite the re-built). It is a delight to visit the Secret Garden to experience the absolute tranquility and beauty of an ancient garden.,474,much
475,102,1122,"The exterior is not as spacious and grand as Gueongbokgung. However, it's a prettier palace with more trees and a mysterious feel. Go visit the secret garden for a stroll (5000Won per entry) We had a great time enjoying the scenery and breeze inside. There are slopes and much steps at the end of the walk and not suitable for person with walking inconvenience.",475,much
476,103,1129,"It's 3,000W to get in then another 5,000W for the secret garden tour. A nice bunch of buildings but to be honest A LOT of it is inaccessible (you can only look from the outside), there isn't too much in between (the grounds feel sparse), and of course so little of it is original. A huge number of people come here each day so I wouldn't call it peaceful but an ok place to visit if it's the only palace you go to while in Seoul.",476,much
477,104,1132,"I visited on a Wednesday. Contrary to the information in some other reviews, there are many secret garden tours available, including 4 per day in English (this depends on the time of year; see the palace website for full details). Currently, the tours take 200 people instead of the palace website stated 100, this may have been due to Chinese National Day. 50 tickets can be booked ahead and the rest are claimed at the palace. I was able to purchase tickets at 11:15 for the 11:30 tour.  As for the palace itself, very nice and the layout is very different from palaces I've seen before. While some of the layout is perpendicular building and walkway placement, much of it is off at odd angles to meld seamlessly with the natural terrain. This was a nice contrast to the forbidden city in Beijing. The garden tour is definitely worth the time (90 minutes). The tour guide has some useful information and the tour group quickly dwindles to a reasonable size, but you're free to leave the tour guide from the start if you like to do your own thing.",477,much

It was a pity that we didn't spend much time at the palace and wish to try the Korean customs. We also didn't have time to visit the secret garden. For me, I will visit this palace next time.",479,much
480,107,1171,"You need to arrive fairly early if you want to do the secret garden tour after the palace tour. English-speaking guides take the tour around the palace at 10.30am and the secret garden tour kicks off at 11.30am. We turned up a bit late so although we had the palace tour, the garden tour was sold out and we had to wait until 1.30pm for that. Luckily our hotel was very near so we nipped back there as there isn't really another two hours of activity once you have toured the palace. The talk was very good at giving an insight into court life, meaning when we later went to Gyeongbokgung Palace we didn't feel it necessary to join a guided tour. Word of warning to the infirm, the garden tour has some quite steep climbs and quite a lot of older and more overweight vistors found the pace a bit intense, especially in the heat. It's also worth buying the four-palace pass if you intend to visit all the palaces in Seoul. We only did these two, but I'd recommend them both. Gyeongbokgung is much bigger and also contains two fantastic museums. A real must visit.",480,much
481,108,1175,"I enjoyed visiting this gorgeous palace. It has so much architecture and history! The day we went was free entrance and we only had to pay for the English-guided garden tour which lasted an hour. When visiting you can see some Koreans dressed in traditional clothes. It can be very humid and hot so stay hydrated! Also, you can take beautiful pictures so I recommend bringing your best camera. Highly recommended if you are in the area!!!",481,much
482,109,1177,"Changdeokgung Palace is set within a large park in Jongno-gu in Seoul. It is one of the “Five Grand Palaces” built by the kings during the Joseon Dynasty. And as such, it was the principal palace for many of the Joseon kings and a 600-year-old UNESCO World Heritage Site.  We were here for a visit as part of our full day city tour. We arrived at around 9.30am and stayed there for slightly over an hour. It was not crowded when we arrived (perhaps it was still early) and our admission fees had been included in our package tour. But I understand that the admission fee is 3,000 won per adult.  The palace ground was massive, with many ""interlinked"" palace buildings from one to another with a big open compound. Of course what was interesting was the ancient style of architectural design and to some extent, similar to the Chinese style. According to our guide, both ancient China and Korea were good allies and thus the country had some influences from the Chinese culture. (in fact, on the roof top of some buildings were designs of the Chinese classic novel, Journey to the West, with the Monkey God, the Tripitaka Master etc, cool!)  Maintenance and conservation work of the buildings had been done here by the city authorities. So we walked from one building to another, with some being able to enter or taking a look from outside on the interior structure of the palaces, such as the King's chair and office, paintings etc!  Along the way, we also saw some people wearing the traditional Korean Hanbok costumes, very nice, colourful and lovely~ And you are keen, you can try them out too!  As we need to visit several attractions in our tour, we were not able to stay to visit the Secret Gardens which according to our guide, was very beautiful and nice!  For us, the visit here was generally fine and interesting to learn about the ancient culture of Korea though we would love to see more like in Gyeongbukgung Palace. Weather was very sunny and warm and do remember to bring along an umbrella, hat and drinking water.  Well, if you are planning to visit some palaces in your trip here, Changdeokgung Palace is also a good option besides the Gyeongbukgung, though the latter has much more to see, besides the buildings and gardens, bigger, there is also an ancient ""change of guard"" ceremony.  But do take note that the former is closed on Mondays and the latter is closed on Tuesdays!",482,much
483,110,1179,"It is a very charming place, the little lake with white water lily. Well maintained place. You have chance to try their traditional dress for photo as well which was fun. I love the architect of this place very much",483,much
484,111,1183,"You wont need too much time here , just a overall look not more than 30 minutes. This is the most important sign of seoul when you visit . Great place for history lovers. You can also find some tour leaders to receive detailed information.",484,much

Also, It was much better to take pictures/hanbok photos as it is less crowded. I missed out on the secret garden because of itinerary constraints but I would urge people to visit the garden during their visit because it is magnificent.",486,much
487,114,1194,Overall i find the Palace in Korea a bit too boring.Is all a shell other than that nothing much to see and everything thing looks the same. Is a shame when you look into the room is either empty or pretty dull. You want to see the richness of it during those days.I reacon they cold do much better. Only highlight i got was the delicious cold Citroen Tea you can buy at the giftshop.That was a really nice drink freshly made lemon tea with pieces of preserved lemons. Loved it.,487,much
488,115,1200,"We came here because the other bigger palace was closed on Tuesday. It was okay, nothing too special in my opinion. But the architect was interesting. It's 3000 won entrance fee and you have to pay extra for the secret garden, which I think is what everyone wants to see. It's another 2000 won and you can only go as part of a guided tour. There is not much shade so it's pretty hot on a summer's day.  Bukchon Village and Insadong Street are close by.",488,much
489,116,1222,"This was my favorite palace, and was recommended by a local as theirs as well. It truly blends Korean architecture with nature. The grounds are surrounded with trees and is much prettier than the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Only frustrating part was that you had to pay an additional fee to view the secret garden. It was really nice that they had a snack bar with free wifi and AC, as it was really hot!!!!",489,much
490,117,1224,Went there with my wife and son especially to see secret garden. Gosh!!! What a waste of time. Nothing to see in that garden. Mughal gardens in india are much better. Took free English tour. Felt walking in a normal garden. But totally disappointed. Guide used to show a simple hut with no great architecture and give its history. I got to know that I am doomed when they told that the 1st place we will visit iin the garden is the most beautiful place. A big no from my side.,490,much
491,118,1225,"the palace follows the usual style of these types of buildings, There's not really much to see but the interiors of the buildings have a lot of interesting detail and if you can get a tour guide it makes the visit and understanding the context more enjoyable",491,much
492,119,1226,"I'd recommend this as your first stop in Seoul to get a feel for what Korea has to offer. It will most likely also be all the palaces and temples you will want to see for your whole time in Seoul, which is fair because there's so much more to do in the city. Maybe my expectations were too high, but while I found it was nice to walk around and experience something I don't normally see which is of high historic value, I found it a little underwhelming. Although for such a low price it's definitely worth it.  You're free to walk around by yourself without a tour, plenty of opportunities to take photos, the tour isn't really essential unless you want to learn a lot about the history. The Secret Garden tour is reasonably good and gives you enough information about the palace to keep you satisfied. Even then, you're not really missing out if you don't take a tour, but it's still nice to do. Jongmyo is the only place in the area where you've forced to take a tour 6 days of the week, so if you have limited time I'd recommend not taking any tours here.",492,much
493,120,1237,"This royal palace was much nicer than kyungbok palace. Kyungbok palace was a nice palace but I was much more impressed by this palace. If you have time, You need to visit secret garden of this palace. It's worthy!",493,much

497,124,1295,"The only reason I give it 4 stars, is that like many places in Korea they don't give information or notice about how much walking is required or the terrain. I took my parents here and they loved the rich history, the large spaces, but the walking, especially on a hot day in Seoul can be a lot. Make sure to go into the Palace and see the bench where the King would sit. It still smells musty and the old yellow curtains hang low. The best spot is the Secret Garden, but note this is a long walk with many steep hills and climbing.",497,much
498,125,1305,"The strange history concerning how many times it has been destroyed and rebuilt (portions at least) is fascinating. And from far it looks small but as you approach you see the intricate details and great attention that was laid to each element that makes it so beautiful. There were lots of people, but I found that charming. It was good to have a tour guide to tell us about the nuances of the structures and the layout and some of the stories that make a place so much richer. Not good to go on a rainy day. Worth a visit if you have the time - about 1:30-2 hours is good enough. Then it becomes a bit repetitive. If you get a chance walk around the area in the city because there is lots to do there as well, not just sightseeing.",498,much

The secret garden was where the king spent most of his time together with his most beloved concubine ( whom he couldn't make as his first wife as he wasn't allowed to choose his own wife) He built a house for her next to the garden ( something unheard apparently , showed how much he loved her)",499,much
500,127,1312,Our annual Rotary International convention was held in Seoul Korea this year. We took a few extra days for sightseeing. This Palace was one of the highlights for me. I love history and I love beautiful things. This inexpensive tour combines both of those. I love the way it Korean culture honors its history. This is a beautiful place to visit without spending too many dollars. You can do the whole thing in an hour or two. I also very much enjoyed the museum adjacent to the Palace. Air-conditioned and a nice restaurant inside it was a good diversion in the middle of a hot day. If you can do this with the tour guide it is even better. Too many things that you simply would not understand without having a guide.,500,much
501,128,1325,"I believe you do not need to visit Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace. They are pretty much the same, though the tour we took at Gyeongbokgung Palace was better. The best part of Changdeokgung Palace was The Secret Garden. You can take the tour of The Palace, and then take the tour of The Secret Garden.

502,129,1336,We took the Secret Garden tour with a knowledgeable English-speaking guide. There are a lot of people who do this tour so I would suggest one to be early as they are punctual. A walk through this Joseon dynasty palatial grounds gives insight into the ways of the Korean royals. The secret garden covers a lot of the palatial grounds with many intricate and unique pavilions and ponds. The setting of these structures was done with much harmony with the landscape. A visit to this palace is absolutely worth it.,502,much

The palace is rather small and the highlight would the garden.For this you have to go on the website and make a booking. We chose to go on Christmas Day thinking it would be quiet but our group was large, at least 30 (sure reminds of my school trips!). Give yourself half an hour to visit the actual palace itself. I loved the garden as it was huge, sitting in an area much bigger than the palace. It was a hunting ground for the king in the olden days so as to give you an idea how large it was. It is an oasis of calm in the midst of Seoul! However, you can only visit with a guide and therefore cannot enjoy it as much as it should be. I love to sit and watch the world go by so that is not possible. Lovely and well worth a visit.",505,much

The first one--a tour of of the buildings and explanation of the history was very hood. The second tour--of the Secret Garden--was only okay. I could barely understand the guide and the Secret Garden was pleasant--but not as impressive as the name conjured. But I was there just before spring, and I suspect it would have been much prettier with the flowers blooming and the trees leafing out. But the palace was ""WOW!""",507,much
508,135,1406,"This is more Korean style palace. That is, it is built according to the nature. The other one - Gyeongbokgung - is more Chinese style which gates and building are all lined up. Even the main gate for this palace is situated in the corner. And they didn't cut down on hills and trees. So it's pretty much of hiking in the city if you take the full course. The palace part is open to everyone except every Mondays, but the secret garden - something more famous - must be reserved beforehand. If you are a small group, there usually are some tickets available at the spot, but I wouldn't risk it. Just reserve it online first. The garden is beautiful and huge and the hills are haha endless. Better wear sneakers. No tough shoes.",508,much
509,136,1424,"We had been to many similar palace's during our Asia trip, so we only noticed subtle differences. It felt like we were seeing much of the same from what we saw prior in China and Japan. Not taking anything away from the site, it was a great experience and well kept. If you havent seen one of these palace's before and you are in the area, worth the visit.",509,much
510,137,1428,"Seeing the garden is by tour only. We brought tickets for the palace and gardens when we arrived in the afternoon but because of the afternoon garden tour time we didn't get a chance to see the palace. We found the garden disappointing during our visit in late March. There was not much colour. Maybe it looks more attractive at other times of the year? We felt the tour guide did little more than walk us from one photo opportunity to another, and also felt the tour could have been done in half the time.",510,much
511,138,1438,This was an interesting palace but we didn't spend very much time here because we were so short of time. I would like to be able to visit it again.,511,much

The place has some young men and women dressed in Korea outfit to walk around and stopped for pictures. They are love birds and felt that I was back to the pass and was walking in the palace hundreds of years ago. Not crowded at all, and it was pleasant to walk around. The trees was so nice and the short explore was a much do in Korea.",512,much
513,140,1463,"Had a few hours to kill so I went to the Changdeokgung Palace to walk around. Went on the garden tour which was muddy and not very interesting. The walking areas are sandy dirt, so plan accordingly as your shoes will be a mess when you leave. It had rained/snowed a few days before my visit and the grounds were not in great shape. Worth going, but probably much nicer in spring and summer. I would not pay extra for the garden tour in the winter as there is not much to see.",513,much
514,141,1501,"This Palace is easily reachable by underground or taxi. Most beautiful trees with red leaves mixing other pine trees were all bald at winter time, so it not as colourful as it is in pictures shot in autumn. All buildings were the same and very plain, may interested those architectural lovers. We attempted to pay fee for the secret garden which must be entered with a tour guide but unfortunately one only time with a chinese tour guide on sunday, for the whole day, can you imagine how interested it can be. The palace charge extra money to enter the secret garden but the service is so limited and travellers take so much time to go there. Tour guides in English is also limited. And I did not think I saw any timetable for the secret garden at the main entrance, may be it is a little secret that should not tell travellers. The ticket seller, probably has limited english ability and will just answer the money you need to pay but nothing else. So if you go, it would be better to enquire the tour guide time for the secret garden if you do not want to miss the boat.",514,much
515,142,1503,My husband is Korean. He took me here because he knew of all the palaces this would be my favorite. And it was. It was smaller than the other palaces (but that isn't saying much because this was huge still) I loved it for the natural beauty. It was breath taking. There was a little pond that you would surely miss if you didn't look for it and it was covered in green lily pads. We watched two ducks roam around the waters. This place was a gem in industrial Seoul!,515,much

Tourists are only allowed to go into the garden at certain time with the guided tour. The tour guide was very helpful and really explained the idea behind each building and their layout. Tour is around 1.5hrs and basically hiking up and down the hill, because the garden was built on a small hill. The guide also recommended us to come back in the autumn. The palace will be much more colorful than it is in the winter.",517,much

The secret garden is only open to guided tours, which need to be booked in advance, and the group can get quite big during peak seasons. There are up and down road/stairs and it's a good 90 minute walk.",519,much
520,147,1619,Nice palace to visit. Loads of walking to do.. Very intricate rooftop designs for the inner palace and the rooms of the king and queen. If I remember correctly.

We took the advice of a very helpful woman at a tourist information booth in Itaewon, and took the garden tour. Our guide was amazing! Her English was exceptional, and she had a great sense of humor. We learned so much about the garden and its history. I loved the stories, and the beauty of the gardens and building. It was early fall, so the leaves were changing beautifully. What a lovely way to spend time enjoying and learning!",521,much

In tour books it seems like it's a day and for us it was Sunday but nothing was back open as usual until Wednesday!  We walked to gyeongbokgung palace but it was closed!  The palace doesn't seem as grandiose as the Gyeongbokgung palace but I couldn't believe how much more there was to the grounds. We explored on our first and then waited for an English speaking tour to pass and then hopped on. We had to pass time before our secret garden tour. I ""reserved"" online weeks before but it didn't seem to matter when we got to the ticket booth. They say that half of the tickets are reserved and the other half is on the day of. 11yo lasted through 2/3 of it but it was still worth it.

We should have prepared better and done bukchon village which is close or jongmyo shrine which is also close.",522,much

This is a coll piece of Korean history and culture which must have been truly spectaculat in the day",523,much

526,153,1684,"It is best to start your tour of the palaces with this one right here. Crowds are few and tour groups, which are both free and in English, are much smaller. The other palaces you can make do without a tour if you have a guide book, you'll notice lots being repeated in terms of the design of the palaces and structure.  This palace also has a secret garden out back which makes for a pleasant stroll. Note that you are not allowed to wander around the garden by yourself but must go with a tour, you are however allowed to amble around the rest of the palace freely.  It takes a good half day to see everything if you're with a tour. Lots of pagodas, ponds and architecture that must be quite stunning in the fall.",526,much
527,154,1688,"It's a must see in Seoul. However if you come straight after a couple of weeks in Japan (as we did) you cannot help comparing Korean and Japanese temples/shrines and I think Korean ones could have been much improved with a bit of painting, landscape design etc",527,much
528,155,1697,"Went here to see the palace and while it felt a little ""barren"" the architecture was why I enjoyed it. I am a fan of building architecture and yes, some of the building had been burned down and rebuilt, but I wanted to learn about the history of the palace and the signs scattered about allowed me to at least understand a bit about that.  We got the package that allowed us to visit all of the UNESCO sites and, apparently, they throw in the tour of the ""secret"" garden which, well, isn't actually too much of a secret. They also call it the ""rear"" garden which is a much more fitting name. its a large area with some natural pools and very quiet areas. After the first three stopping points it gets a bit hilly so those who are not as ambulatory or are in a wheelchair/use a cane/have problems walking easily on incline surfaces should probably skip the last two stops.  Overall it was a nice place to visit and see the grounds and palace. It is also nearby to Insadong, which is a shopping district (mainly souvenirs) but we strolled there as well afterwards and it was a nice relaxing place to visit.  Overall I'd say at least check it out if you are a fan of history, architecture or both.",528,much
529,156,1699,"One of South Korea's most popular tourist attractions. At the entrance there is a Changing of the Guard, somewhat of a Korean variant on Buckingham Palace, with traditional costumes and music. I believe this place can be crowded at times, but Friday noon it was ok. The park is large with another large garden, the further you will walk into the park, the more quiet it becomes. And that is the moment where you really get to enjoy it. Peaceful relaxation and stunning views into the mountains. I am normally not much of an historician but would like to come back here one day just early in the morning or late in the evening.",529,much

We sat under the pagoda and just sat in peace under the shade from the humid weather . There was a entrance fee which wasn't much but so worth while to see . Would of been better with a English speaking guide to tell you the history of the place but we saw it on our travels and just went in,532,much

536,163,1733,"We went on what was National children's day. It was very crowded and that made it difficult to see most of the exhibit. We did see them practicing for a parade of soldiers, but our guide was not very good at expalining it. The main part of the palace was colorful and the architectural details impeccable. It had been rebuilt after a fire. I actually do not remember much but the crowds.",536,much

Ancient pavilions with chinese poem on it could be found. But it's not too much of a surprise to us. Perhaps we were already awestruck by Gyeongbokgung palace a day earlier =)",539,much

The Guided tour in English started at 10:00hrs but we were there by 9:00hrs and we already look around and took photos. This is recommended if you like to focus on the interesting history talks of the tour guide wearing Traditional Korean Hanbok while showing you around the palace. It will take an hour till your next tour to the Secret Garden. That's why you don't have time to take much photos because there's a lot of places you will be visiting with the group (in fast pace) then next going uphill to the garden. You must wear running shoes, enough sunblock, insect repellent, water and eye shades as you are going to do some hiking. We visited the area during summer (June 2015). The tour in the secret garden and the admission fee are separate purchase at the ticket booth. But since you are already there, you might be up to doing some adventure while discovering the King's hide out when he needs to be alone and relax. Definitely a must visit!",540,much
541,168,1766,This is definitely one of the most beautiful places in Seoul. The carefully curved and colorfully decorated buildings look really marvelous. When walking along I had a chance to admire the old builders' effort. That gave me the chance to imagine how much the Koreans respected the emperor's authority. The buildings are perfectly set inside the peaceful park. This is very Asian style which philosophy is to cooperate not interfere with nature. Walking along the gardens was a very relaxing experience for me after the hustle and bustle of contemporary Seoul. To sum up this place is one of Your must see list when in Korea.,541,much

But note that the Piwon is only open to guided tours that are alternatively in Korean, Japanese and English, so make sure to check the schedule and get there early because the tour of the Piwon is very popular. Also, be prepared for a long walk uphill and downhill through the Secret Garden, which must be as large as the gardens at Versailles but is much more rugged terrain. There's a fee for the Secret Garden, but it's only about $5 and it's worth it. I went with a friend on a very hot day in July and it was exhausting but worthwhile. The gift shop has a little cafe and is air conditioned; they also have expensive but nice souvenirs as well as wi-fi (the only place on the grounds of the palace with wi-fi). When you leave, walk out the main gate to the right and walk just a few blocks and you'll be in Bukchon Village, which is also really worthwhile; it's also a good place to eat lunch or dinner.",542,much

Out tour guide was very good, although she reminded me a little too much of JuDee (tour guide from the Avatar cartoons). Beatiful grounds and. Interesting history made this a very worth while location.",543,much
544,171,1776,"I wouldn't call this a must see, but I must say that I really enjoyed it despite the biting cold. One thing I love about Seoul's historical attractions is that they include free English tours, you just have to make sure you have the times right and that you are on time. Unfortunately I missed the last secret garden tour, which is said the be the highlight. Nevertheless, I found the tour to be fun, interesting, and very informative. Really, don't miss the tour, it is 70% of the experience. I found it more interesting than the main palace, Gyeongbukgong, equally beautiful, and much less crowded.",544,much
545,172,1781,We were able to catch the english tour which was so much more informative and interestinf then just walking around by yourself.

Free admission for the month of july!,545,much
546,173,1787,"A nice palace with the usual decorated roofs, and pleasing complexes of interconnected buildings. The secret garden was fine, but not especially beautiful, and a long organised walk in a large group is not the best way to enjoy it.

Luckily, the palace is beautiful and has a distinctive style so it is easy to explore. If you visit, do spare time to join the back garden tour.

548,175,1833,"In case you are a business traveller, and have very little time to see through the rich Korean history in Seoul, this place (Changdoekgung) along with the other one in heart of city (Gyeongbukgung) would be an ideal place for an afternoon short trip - it's well possible to squeeze any of these palaces between your morning meetings and evening drinking sessions...  Changdeokgung is the only UNESCO World Heritage site out of the Five Grand Palaces built by Joseon dynasty which ruled Korea. Magnificent piece of authentic ancient Korean architecture.  There are many tour operators who offers a package of Changdoekgung with night markets etc., but you will need to enquire first whether they will take you into the 'Secret Garden'... you SHOULD NOT miss it. I booked with an operator, and upon learning that they will only provide entry to the palace and not the 'Secret Garden', I decided to abandon the tour midway and be on my own.  The palace and 'Secret Garden' tickets are sold separately, and 'Secret Garden' is opened to a batch of tourists with a Palace guide guiding you on the trail once every 15-30 mins. So, you may have to get in there, and plan for a secret garden ticket with a slot an hour at least from when you reach (sometimes there is quite a rush, and number of tickets per slot is limited to a maximum 30 ish). I spent the hour seeing the palace, and then went for the Secret Garden tour, which is technically 70% of the palace area.  It was worth a wait. Lush-green tree-rows with beautifully crafted lake-houses .... the flora was just amazing. ... I wonder if I liked the whole trail so much in summer, how good it will be during the spring season..  The only flip-side which I will regret - taking a Korean tour of 'Secret Garden' [every slot of Secret Garden tour is in a specific language and only few were in English] since the next English tour available was still couple of hours more of wait. so couldn't make much out of the context. But hey.. you always have a Wikipedia, it's the visual and other sensory experiences that matter...",548,much

This Palace has lots of history than Gyeongbukgong. if I remembered correctly from the guided tour. And the story about the last Prince (or was it King?), who rebuilt a quarter especially for his lover, was so romantic. If you are not travelling with kids, I really recommend that you have to follow the guided tour as the guide knows so much.",549,much
550,177,1850,"In my opinion, this palace is much more worth visiting compared to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The minute I stepped onto the palace ground, the palace seems to reach out to you, eager to share its history with you. The palace is of a considerable size and you need to take your time to appreciate each and every building. As the halls and living quarters are built apart from each other, every time I looked into a hall or a living quarter, I try to imagine how life was like for a royalty back in the Joseon period. It would be great if you can hire a guide or get an audio guide to help better understand the rich history of the palace. As I went to the palace after mid-noon, we missed the guided tour to the Secret Garden located just beside the palace. Make sure you check the timing for the English tour and head down early to book a spot. I really enjoyed this palace and since I didn't get to visit the Secret Garden, I definitely have a valid reason to revisit again!",550,much

Probably in general it is the same for the others palaces as well -- Gyeongbukgung, Deoksukgung. The only difference will be in the details. The secret garden is ok but truly a very long walk and especially not for those too tired after visiting other areas in Seoul. Its a series of walk up and down small hills. And I have visited much more beautiful gardens in Kyoto.",552,much

The area surrounding the palace also had some hanuks and local artisan shops you can explore.",553,much

The gardens are well maintained and it was clean.  Lots of obnoxious high schoolers running around unsupervised, making noise, etc.  If you're in Seoul you should go, but compared to some of the other places in Asia I have been, it wasn't that great.  Just my opinion.",554,much

It was very cold - 10 Celsius, and the Airport even provided free down parkas. The Palace is well preserved. It was educational and picturesque.

It's much smaller than I thought and may be it had to do with the Korean history, but the palace seems to be pretty basic. Like a poor man's version of the Forbidden City.",562,much
563,190,1949,I decided to visit the palace as I had never seen something like this before. There was a relatively cheap entrance fee and there were not many people so the trip was very slow paced and relaxing. The grounds are quite large so give yourself about 2 hours to see it properly and read the information boards along the way which explain the historical significance of the palace. There are many buildings to see and appreciate the architecture of the time. There are guards at the front gate wearing traditional costume with whom you can take some photos with if you wish. I enjoyed it very much.,563,much

I really fell in love to the place and thinking back in times how they live their day to day life in this very large area.

If you want to know every place of its history, it is highly recommended to make the reservation on its official website as early as possible for a understandable language. No advance payment is required.  Upon arrival at the Secret Garden, we were a bit disappointed because it's too early for the beautiful Autumn leaves at the end of October, not much were seen. However, the weather is nice and comfortable, it took us 2.5 - 3 hours to walk, take pictures and enjoy the environment (without following the Japanese tour guide). It is a nice & relaxing place to visit. We may learn more of Its history on its official website or UNESCO's.",568,much

570,197,2047,"We arrived and realized that we had visited 6 years earlier. We paid the entry fee and went in anyway. We had the same impression that we had on our prior visit. It is impressive, but it is stark and bare, leaving too much to our limited imaginations. The last time that we visited we took a tour in English and paid the extra fee for the Secret Garden, only accessible by tour. Both were well worth the fees and time spent. This is a UNESCO World Heritage site and while we would never want it turned into a Disney version of a palace, it would be great to see an exhibit (drawings, models, film) of what all of these buildings were used for and what they may have looked like when the palace was inhabited. Next to the Secret Garden entrance was an entrance to another palace, the Changoyeonggung Palace. It was only about $1 each and it turned out to be the highlight of our day. I understand an additional fee for the Secret Garden, but would have preferred that the visit was not limited to a guided tour. I also would have liked that a brochure be offered with the entry fee or for an additional charge. There were a few plaques in English throughout, but more information and history would have been a great addition.",570,much
571,198,2049,"Changedeokgung is a beautiful palace albeit much smaller than Gyeongbukgung. It was not too crowded when we visited on a Tuesday. We bought combination tickets for $10k Won each which allows one to visit the various palaces in Seoul as well as the Jongmyo Shrine. This includes the Secret Garden too. If you plan on visiting at least 2 of these attractions, it is worth buying the combination tickets. We arrived early and were able to join the first English speaking tour for the morning. It is good to join the tour (free) as the guide will provide commentaries and information as well as historical background to the many buildings / rooms within the palace grounds. We particularly enjoyed the little snippets the guide shared with us regarding the daily lifestyle & stories of the Kings & Queens who lived there. The tour last about an hour and it ends near the entrance to the Secret Garden. This was very well planned as we could immediately make our way to the next guided tour to the Secret Garden scheduled at 1130am. The Secret Garden tour took about 90minutes and we had a nice relaxing time there. Some portions of the gardens are quite steep but the guide always allow a short time of rest for us to recover before moving on.",571,much

If you're taking the city tour, the other one is stop #22 and this is #23. Take 23. It's a much larger palace with a secret garden. .secret garden is a different fee to get in and I didn't go there but I've read that it's one of the main attractions not to be missed. This palace (grounds) is much larger with beautiful architecture.",573,much
574,201,2070,"I had pre-booked my Huwon (Secret Garden) Tour online and I would recommend visitors to do so. Although you will still have to queue to retrieve your tickets, at least you are guaranteed for the tour, in your preferred language (and you will be aware of the relevant time slots too). The land area is massive and there is much to explore in Changdeokgung Palace even without the Huwon; however, I reckon one might get bored easily without a guide. One positive thing to note is that due to its size, I didn't feel that it was too crowded although there were many visitors (even local groups bringing their children along for study trips).  The Huwon tour though is definitely my highlight to Changdeokgung Palace. The Huwon harmonises with its natural terrains as its pavilions and gardens are built on slopes and around its large hills. Hence, most of these beauties are hidden from sight, if you are not following the tour. On the other hand, the route may be difficult as there is some hiking involved (just a tough on the elderly) and the tour would be almost impossible for those bound on wheelchair as maneuvering around it gets really tricky. Be prepared, with a good pair of walking shoes.",574,much
575,202,2093,"3000W each to enter and English tour (only 1 at 2.30pm). No English maps etc. We have visited many temples in Korea - Busan, Sockcho etc. This was uninspiring. Too much dust and open space, some pleasant vistas but the backdrop of hi-rise is a real annoyance. Very tricky to get real quality photos here. I had to focus on close-ups. Very average for the price....",575,much
576,203,2099,"The palace is a very nice place, and with much less people than the major palace in Seoul. Some of the buildings and gates are original and dating from early 15 century. 1 hour to 90 min should be ok for a good visit. The tickets are cheap, as all the major attractions in Seoul, for this one for example the entrance is around USD3",576,much
577,204,2104,Or maybe I have seen too many palaces. We did the English tours of palace and garden. I wish the guide had not made it seem so much like work for her and for us. But it was ok. Just not great.,577,much
578,205,2116,I visited the palace on a weekday and found that it was much less crowded than the Gyeongbokgung Palace which was nice since this allowed for time to stroll around and take pictures. The whole complex was very beautiful and it was really interesting to see the original-type architecture of Seoul. I didn't do the Secret Garden tour but found that I really enjoyed the palace regardless. Definitely worth the admission price and there are brochures and information boards throughout so you get an understanding of which buildings were used for different purposes.,578,much
579,206,2118,"You can visit it now with an entrance fee aside from that needed to enter the palace itself. Though every last Wednesday of the month the palace entrance is free. I have been inside the Deoksugung Palace which is closest to the town center, Changdeokgung is much bigger and with an English tourist guide (scheduled), I had a better appreciation of the history of the palace i.e the history of rooms, space, engravings etc. My group wanted to have our own free walk in the Secret Garden because we were short of time but we were not allowed too – seems that visitors have to follow the guide once inside the garden. It is quite huge, to make sure the queen was not bored or/and having a feeling of melancholy being forbidden to step outside of the palace. Almost like being outside, it’d be more beautiful in the fall or winter.",579,much
580,207,2122,"I have not seen Changdeokgung in the daytime, so this review is strictly about the Moonlight Tour. I was looking forward to the tour with great anticipation, as it is only offered to foreigners six nights a year, with a limit of 100 tickets per night. I made a special point to be online and order tickets the minute they went on sale, that's how much I wanted to take this tour.  The tour was offered in English, Chinese, and Japanese, and attendees were divided into groups accordingly. That part was good. I expected the pathways, buildings and garden to be illuminated (not brightly so as to recreate daytime, but at least so that we could see what we were being shown) but sadly, this was not the case. A small number of attendees were asked to carry paper lanterns as we walked the grounds, and there were a few lights on the buildings, but I couldn't really see much. The pathways were unlit (the few paper lanterns scattered about were ineffective), and the ground is quite uneven, with random obstacles on the path (something which looked like pipe vents, at one point there was something that looked like an empty concrete pond, completely unlit, which someone could easily have tripped into), and we were marched from building to building very quickly. There was a lot of hiking up stairs and then down stairs, all stone, all uneven, all unlit. What could have been a pleasant walking tour felt more like a march in the dark. We were ""treated"" to a tour of the rear ""secret"" garden but were unable to see anything - I mean absolutely nothing. So what was the point of taking us through the garden? I'm still not sure.  When we reached the pavilion at the end of the garden, there was one building which was beautifully lit, with a large (unlit) pond in front of it. A musician played a traditional Korean gayageum, and we got to sit and listen for about 10 minutes. This part of the tour was quite lovely.  Tea and traditional Korean sweets were part of the tour, but the tea was served in paper cups - take one as you walk past a table, and keep moving - and the sweets were handed to you in a (very nice) fabric bag. I didn't expect a formal tea ceremony, but I also didn't expect a paper cup. This was just one more disappointment.  From there we sat as an audience in front of a stage area, where we were treated to another lovely musical performance consisting of several different types of performances. This was the highlight of the tour. If this had not been included, my rating would have been ""poor"" rather than ""average."" After that, we had to walk about 15 minutes back to the entrance, with no guidance, minimal lighting, and, once again, hidden obstacles.  Cost: 30,000 won per person. I would not recommend it. Go in the daytime, walk at your own pace, and you will undoubtedly get much more enjoyment for much less money.",580,much
581,208,2129,Look I have to start with a disclaimer and say that old palaces and the like tend not to be too much of my thing. That said I did enjoy the trip here and really do recommend taking the time to make your way here if you are in Seoul. The guides are really very knowledgeable and the gardens within the grounds of the palace are well worth checking out. If not for any other reason that you are in a busy and bustling city yet are in what is really a quite secluded and serene garden and nature walk. I suppose it is the juxtaposition that is most striking about it.,581,much
582,209,2130,"Its a beautiful palace with a huge amount of grounds and wasn't overly crowded. I have to say despite its beauty I did find it a little bit samey in design/architecture without much variation from the style. Its worth a visit, and get a guide if you can because its very thorough and informative. Takes about 1-2 hours to look around. There is access to the 'secret garden' but it costs more so we didn't go. Try and go when its sunny as the colours on the buildings are better! Near to Insadong and other palaces/temples. This is easy to find (its huge) and is about 10-15 minutes away from various metro stations.",582,much
583,210,2155,"The palace itself is interesting, but lack of any identification of what the buildings were or their significance to the historical period has you looking at a lot of buildings that all look very similar. Once you've seen one or two, you've seen them all. The Secret Garden is also interesting, but it too has many of the same structures without much difference in their historical value. It was interesting but not worth 90 minutes. Guided tour is large group with single guide, you can easily miss our out the naration.",583,much
584,211,2161,"Excellent, very much worth a visit, if you are interested in Korea's ancient history. Ground can be a bit uneven so watch your step, very good.",584,much
585,212,2190,"This is my second palace tour in Seoul and while the throne hall is not as ""grand"" as the one in Gyeongbokgung Palace, it has its own charm and I love it!.  The palace is not that crowded or maybe our guide simply took us on places that were not part of the official tour given by this place. I'm glad I signed up for this free tour and because it's a small group, we get much better chance to ask more questions and stray away from the usual pack of tourists roaming around. I love the fact that some areas are really quiet where you can simply sit down on an open balcony and admire the beauty of its surroundings.  The structures of this palace is great and true to its description, it follows the natural topography of the site instead of imposing themselves upon it. I also love the short hike on the natural garden at the back of the palace.",585,much
586,213,2191,"This palace is much more beautiful than it's big brother to the east. Changdeokgung has a more cobbled together feel, and somehow a more Korean feel than the large rectangular layout of Gyeongbokgung. The gardens are a highlight. Try to get on a tour of the back garden if you can, but if you miss the slot just wandering around the palace grounds is a treat. Especially good in spring and autumn.",586,much
587,214,2194,whow -really impressive and perfectly restored- it is a most if you really want to enjoy all of it -take ample of time and idepending on your taste a tour guide or at least a good guide book -so much to learn and to discover,587,much

589,216,2211,"I joined the Secret garden tour as I missed the free tour. The secret garden was great and the tour guide was great. But I believe it would be much more interesting to listen to stories for the palace rather than the garden. Nevertheless, the tour and palace is worth seeing.",589,much
590,217,2213,"Changdeokgung Palace is a charming historical place that should be on everyone's Seoul itinerary. While Gyeongbokgung Palace is the more popular and larger attraction, Changdeokgung offers a more personal and intimate experience because of its smaller (but still expansive) compound and the lovely Secret Garden. There are two guided tours here - the outer main buildings and the Secret Garden. I highly recommend both. With so much history and information to absorb, it would be an injustice to the place if you walk around on your own. The Secret Garden, by the way, can only be accessed via the official guided tour. Our tour guides on both tours were outstanding and spoke excellent English. Their knowledge was, of course, extraordinary, but they also made great effort to talk clearly and slowly. The buildings of the palace were most interesting to me.This palace as I understand it was mainly for living more than ceremonies. It was fascinating to see living quarters of royalty as well as those that served it. Spanning centuries, the palace remained in use until the last century. The tours took us not only through the buildings, but indeed through time. The Secret Garden was fun but busy with scores of people joining the tour. While hearing the tour guide commentary was difficult at times, we did get the chance to see some striking pavilions by pools and walk along tree-lined paths that really made my day. Anecdotes and tidbits delivered by the guide enhanced a really good visit.",590,much
591,218,2216,We spent about four hours at this palace. The secret garden is beautiful but not for people unable to walk distances or climb stairs. We enjoyed our visit very much. It was the first palace we visited on our trip.,591,much
592,219,2218,"We were disappointed. Although this site is nicely preserved, there wasn't much to see. There was an extra entrance fee for the secret garden, which according to the guide books was the gem of this site. We didn't go in unfortunately. Strollers? Impossible to lug up the huge stone steps in front of every building. Families with young children need to be better prepared than we were.",592,much
593,220,2222,"It is easy to find fault with the Palace but that would be missing the point. The site is readily accessible, good value, and interesting in its context. We were not on a tour and found taking our time to wander where we liked a more relaxing approach and signage was adequate. Restoration and reconstruction efforts have resulted in an historical 'oasis' amongst the hustle and bustle of modern Korea. For certain, it would be nice to walk around inside the buildings and see fully furnished interiors but that is unrealistic for large numbers of visitors, the wear and tear would be too much. We found it interesting to discuss the similarities and differences with other Asian palaces we have visited. The setting and the landscape both contribute to the experience.",593,much
594,221,2238,"Go early, really. Plus the 'audio guide shop' was 'sold out' within the first hour we arrived! Until we asked a Korean lady who still managed to get them - the guides are actually available NEXT to the bureau de change! Plus you are required to place your passport with them as a deposit - But they do double check before returning the passports to you which is assuring. The place - just average for me - nothing much to see and gardens were just okay.",594,much
595,222,2247,This palace is an easy walk from Anguk station on the orange line. Adult admission for the english language palace tour + secret garden tour was around 18000 won. There is an english brochure for 500 won. We took the 10:30 am palace tour followed by the 11:30 garden tour. The garden tour was 1.5 hours long. You can tour the palace on your own but to see the gardens you must be with a guide.  The guides wear traditional hanboks and both of my guides spoke good english. The palace tour is interesting and there was enough information without being overloaded with trivia. The garden tour however was more about the scenery. The lady talked about the functions of the different areas of the gardens but it wasn't very compelling. Also it was more enjoyable to not be in the throng of 50 people that were on the tour and to straggle behind.  I found this palace more interesting than Gyeongbokgung and it is much larger than Deoksugung.,595,much
596,223,2248,"How to get there: Anguk Station, Exit 3  We toured Changdeokgung last April 15. Our tour guide informed us that unlike the Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung is more of authentic Korea-style palace. Inside Changdeokgung are another attractions which are the Secret Garden and Huwon, wherein you will pay for another entrance fee.  Entrance fee for the Changdeokgung is KRW 3,000. But with the Integrated Royal palaces (IRP) Ticket for KRW 10,000, you may visit Seoul's 4 palaces and Jongmyo shrine as much as you want for a month.",596,much
597,224,2253,"Changdeokgung Palace is much more tranquil than the other two major palaces of Seoul. It is surrounded by lush gardens and greenery, which even in the winter’s snow can make Changdeokgung look remarkably picturesque, rivalling perhaps even the wintery sight of the incredible Ginkaku-Ji temple in Kyoyo, Japan.  The main garden here is called Huwon which is 78 acres of amazing tranquil greenery. Depending on the season, you can see snow, autumnal leaves or possible some cherry blossoms.  Changdeokgung is the longest-serving royal palace in Seoul, and this made me want to visit it to see what the fuss was about. I enjoyed an hour or so looking at the intricate architecture, but to the untrained eye you must remember that a lot of these palaces and buildings within them all look very similar, so unless you have a particular interest in Joseon Dynasty era palaces, then I think you should prioritise your palaces, and thus I must recommend Gyeongbokgung.",597,much
598,225,2254,"Our first palace visit in Seoul was Gyeongbokgung. That was a great introduction to the Joseon dynasty, and our visit to Changdeokgung added to that experience. The history of this palace is covered extensively elsewhere, and all the practical information required is in the excellent KTO page http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264348  We bought an Integrated Ticket of Palaces which covers Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, Gyeongbokgung and Jongmyo Shrine. This was excellent value at 10,000 won.  This time we managed to join an English speaking tour, and we learned so much about life in the royal palaces in that era. As with Gyeongbokgung, there are seats dotted around, so you can bring a picnic or rest your weary feet.  The English tours to the palace are at 10:30am and 14:30, and the English tours to the Secret Garden are at 11:30 and 15:30. We started with the 10:30 palace tour followed immediately by the 11:30 garden tour, and this proved exhausting, especially for my parents who are in their 70s. If time permits, my advice would be to have a break in between the tours by heading to nearby Insadong or Bukchon, with its art galleries, independent craft shops, cafes and restaurants.  You could even consider returning on another day for the Secret Garden. On no account should you join in another language group for the garden tour, as visitors all have to stick together and you are not permitted to wander off on your own. You will be stuck for 90 minutes with a guide speaking in a language you do not understand.  Take this visit at a leisurely pace. This is Seoul at its historical and cultural best and it would be a shame to factor in Changdeokgung as simply one more thing to cross off your Seoul 'to do' list.",598,much

It was quite long but very informative and good to get away from the palace crowds for a bit. It really didn't feel like you're in the middle of a cosmopolitan city when you're standing in a pavillion next to a pond. Really beautiful. Just wish that there was more to see in the buildings as, apart from the throne room, everything is pretty much empty.",601,much
602,229,2290,we visited in November so it was very quiet which despite the cold was actually very nice and peaceful as it felt like we were the only group around! we bought the combination ticket which allows entry into several palaces including the famous secret garden in this palace.  I would definitely recommend to book a tour of your language of choice as this makes the walk around much more interesting instead of walking around an empty palace! The tour guide was very informative and spoke great english.  I enjoyed the secret garden the most and it is possible to get some beautiful shots here! we managed to even catch some autumn red leaves!  if travelling in the winter do make sure to wear comfortable shoes and wrap up! the palace ground tour lasts for 1hour and then the secret garden tour for 90 minutes.,602,much
603,230,2291,Visited Gyeongbukgung back in 2006 and thought we should visit this palace as well since Changdeokgung is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. But I didn't see much difference between both palaces (building and the grounds). Didn't get to visit the garden as we missed the last English tour which is at 2.30pm. Probably we should have come during other seasons as the palace looks bleak and melting snow was dripping from the roof during winter.,603,much
604,231,2293,"This is one of favorite palaces in Seoul. The garden and pond area are a must-see! Unfortunately, when we visited the pond was under maintenance and was drained. This was very disappointing but the palaces and garden area was still very beautiful. I would definitely recommend a tour because the grounds are beautiful on their own but the stories make it so much more interesting. There is quite a bit of walking but it is mostly flat so I found it fine to wear sandals but be prepared to walk a lot.",604,much
605,232,2304,"I went to all three palaces and this was def the nicest. It is remodeled and seems to have some sort of structure. I wish I took a tour as I don't know much about what I was looking at. There are small signs here and there, and large signs with lots and lots of info. I also wish I was able to book a secret garden tour which was not available to be day of because it seemed all the tour groups had booked it. Nearby is a children's museum which was fun for me.

The english tours at all of them are 11 1 and 3 with changing of the guard on the hour. I would definitely take the tour so you know what your looking at.

622,249,2436,"This is my second times visiting this palace.Since I am alone and nobody is holding me back, Instead of blindly roaming the palace alone, I decide to join the Palace tour + The secret garden tour. Both in English. For the palace tour (KRW 3,000), the guide is and old lady, clearly explain the history of this palace and all. I think, if times allow, it is better you join this tour because it is a waste to only look at this beautiful buildings without knowing the story behind it. But, if you too concern about your time (ya, there is a lot to do in Seoul in 1 day), you can skip this.  Just after I finished the Palace Tour, I continue with the Secret Garden Tour. It will cost you KRW 5,000. I have to warned you, it is not and easy tour, because you will hike up a small hill, do a lot of walking here. A good and comfy shoe will help you a lot. But do not worry so much because the guide is good enough to arrange sufficient stop for you to catch your breath. On top of that, if you are not able to finished your tour, just let her know, and she will point you the nearest exit to you. Just for you to know, this Secret Garden is not actually a garden, it is more to a forest behind the palace. So, if visiting a beautiful forest is not your thing, don't go. As for me, it is worth a visit.",622,much

We were unable to book an online reservation last year since the reservation page was not in English. This time, it is and reservation was a breeze. Entrance fee to the garden must be combined with the palace tour- very cheap at 9,000 won. We went much earlier than our 1130AM guided tour to the Garden. Presented our reservation confirmation form to the cashier, paid the fee and went around this beautifully-preserved Palace. Unlike our last year's rain-filled visit, the weather this time was sunny yet cool. 5 minutes after 1130, our big group was herded to the Garden. It was enchanting.

636,263,2567,"This is the second palace visited on a Saturday (after Gyeongbokgung Palace) and is the only World Heritage Site of the 4 palaces. Arrived around 1pm and spent about an hour here following the numbering of the buildings in the provided brochure. Ticket costs KRW3000 (~USD2.70) with an additional fee to visit Huwon. If one is keen to see this ""Secret Garden"" then advanced booking is best. It seems the regular ticket will allow one to see many structures in this palace complex, but cover less than half of the area (Huwon is rather large).  The brochure which came with the ticket is an excellent one and quite sufficient for navigating through the complex, with rather substantial information for identifying unique features of the buildings and understanding the architecture. Changdeokgung minus Huwon seems much smaller than Gyeongbokgung and takes a shorter time to visit. However after seeing much in Gyeongbokgung, this required a bit more effort to appreciate. Also, worth noting is that the crowds seemed unavoidable here, probably due to the small size of Changdeokgung, the fact that it was visited later in the day and on a weekend.  Thought the blue tiled roof of Seonjeongjeon was rather unique, but personally found the Nakseonjae Complex stood out the most because of its simplicity, reflecting the character of the King who lived here.  Overall, a very good visit to Changdeokgung, and a worthy inclusion to exploring Seoul. Note that this palace is closed on Mondays. Also there is a month-valid combination ticket to visit the other three palaces and Jongmyo shrine nearby. These are all within walking distance but would be rather difficult to properly appreciate in one full day.  If coming by metro, Changdeokgung is accessible by Line 3 (Anguk station) Exit 3.",636,much

If you have the chance to do the moonlight tour, even though it is much more expensive (30,000 won) it is totally worth it. They tour you around the grounds and at the end there is an amazing performance of traditional Korean music, dance, and singing.",637,much
638,265,2570,"Must be the size of the place. It's much smaller compared to Gyeongbokgung. And you definitely must try and fit in for a guided tour.

640,267,2600,"For somewhat who is interested in East Asia history, one must visit this palace. There is a very real difference between Chinese and Korean royal buildings. Korea's last dynasty Joseon, was Confucian in principle and practice, and I might add far more Confucian than later dynasties in China (where Confucianism originated).  This difference is apparrent in palace architecture and royal tombs. While the Forbidden City Palace is perhaps the most grand palace in the world, Changdeokgung is rather simple, not in a bad way. This is by design. Moreover, while Chinese tombs were designed often as monumental structures by the Emperor destined to abide there, in Korea the view was different.  Joseon strictly adhered to Confucian princliples, which are very concerned with humility, filial devotion, and the dignity of simplicty. Therefore, concerning palace and tomb architecture it was ideal to construct buildings that showed the dignity and honour of the dynasty, but equally important was humility in design. Feng Shui was also far more important than grandiosity, much time was spent by geomancers to select the best location for royal palaces or tombs. Changdeokgung is considered one of the finest locations of any building in Korea.  Changdeokgung encapsilates this philosphy better than any other Korean palace, and this is one reason it is a Unesco World Heritage site. For 288 years Changdeokgung was the primary palace of the very long ruling Joseon dynasty. Kings were born, numerous royal weddings took place, and royalty died in this palace complex. Kings wrote poetry in the secret garden, one famous poem is etched in stone here.  It is true some parts of the palace have been rebuilt after Korea's tumultous history during the 20th century, but there are numerous structures that are very well preserved. Geumcheongyo Bridge is the oldest bridge in Seoul and dates back to 1411. The oldest wooden buildings are from the 17th century, as the palace was burned to the ground in the Imjin War. Injeongjeon Hall, the most grand building of the palace was last rebuilt in 1804.  The secret garden is the most celebrated of all Korean gardens, in which harmony with nature is of primary importance. Much of the trees in the garden are over 300 years old, some planted by royalty. It should also be noted that IUCN designated the secret garden as a conservation area because of its diverse ecosystem and landscape, despite being in central Seoul.  I have taken 5 tours of Changdeokgung palace, all of them different. It is one of the most important historical sites related with the Joseon dynasty. If history is not your thing, at the very least you can enjoy the beautful garden and imagine a different age.",640,much
641,268,2622,"I only visited this palace because I had extra time in Seoul and had half a day to spend on this palace, Insa-dong, and the Buchon villiage. Do not expect a grand palace as Gyeongbokgung. If you want to visit, come for the history not for the sight.  Unlike Gyeongbokgung which is connected to the subway station, the Changaokgung is a bit of a walk from the subway station. Just when I thought I missed it, there it was. This palace does not boast a large foot print and does not have as many grand structures as Gyeongbokgung. There is no guards nor ceramoney. There is not much to see really. The english tour is only about $3 and the guide tried her best and made the palace tour more interesting than it was.  There is a secret garden behind the palace, which occupies most of the land and requires a seperate entrance which I will described below. The tour costs $5 and the tour guide also did a great job. However, the garden is similar to our community garden back home, with a few traditional Korean structures scattered around. It is a hilly garden and not the best for the physically challenged.  If anyone is planning on a day tour to cover this palace, the secret garden, Insa-dong, and the village, one needs to be fit. If you are like me who only hikes 2-5 miles a day, I recommend skipping the secret garden (or the Changdaekgung all together) and use your time and energy for other things more exciting in Seoul, which are plentiful. You can read about the history of Changdaekgung without spending precious time here.",641,much
642,269,2634,"Good to read up first and focus on the chambers that you intend to visit. A guided tour would be good to explain in details. Wonderful experience to witness the change-of-guard possession. Take it easy, savour the rich culture, close your eyes and envision the time the Officers were standing according to their ranks. I did not walk around too much but the ancient buildings, vastness, how sommers were being kept cool (by lifting doors in hanging horizontal positions) were a marvel.",642,much
643,270,2637,"If you're palace hopping in Seoul, this one is highly recommended -- there are quite a few buildings to check out, regular English tours of the buildings and the Secret Garden, and plenty of spots for interesting pictures. You can check out the buildings unguided, and that would take up less than an hour (depending on how short your attention span is). I didn't get a guide and that's probably why I left thinking it was a pretty place but without much insight on the history (brochure was pretty thin and mostly served as a map).  Re Secret Garden, when choosing an exit option, the ""never before trodden"" one is okay -- they say it's hilly and long but it didn't feel like it was more difficult to walk that way than the ""retracing your steps to the entrance of the garden"" route. Budget 1.5 hours for the Secret Garden if you're guided (in certain seasons, you can wander about unguided). English tourists on the 11:30 run -- bring a sandwich and a drink! It's a huge garden, and you can't get lunch inside.  While there, see the Bukchon houses and Insadong -- these top tourist spots are all near the Anguk Station.",643,much
644,271,2641,"Apart from the size, I'm not impress with this palace much. The style are similar to other palace in Seoul. It's also very crowded, so full of people rushing to follow tour guides.",644,much
645,272,2644,"The palace itself is average. You cannot go inside any of the buildings, but the grounds are well kept and the exteriors are well renovated. The guided tours are awful, so don't waste your time. The guides rush from location to location and begin speaking as soon as they reach the next spot, but before the majority of the travelers have caught up. Even with a microphone, we could not hear what one of our guide was saying she spoke so softly. The groups, especially for the Huwon, are massive, so that also makes it challenging to keep up and hear your tour. Also, the guides dictate, verbatim, what is in the pamphlet they hand you when you buy your tickets, so you could easily have a much more enjoyable self-guided tour on your own schedule. While we were able to tour the Huwon on our own, I do believe for the most part, you are required to be with a guide. The Huwon was beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there photographing it. Do not expect your typical floral garden- there are very few flowers in the Huwon, which our friends were disappointed to discover. The garden features nicely maintained buildings, some small ponds and lots of greenery on well shaded pathways. The Huwon is a great stop in Korea.",645,much
646,273,2645,The others were much more pleasing to the eye. Still important part of Korean history.,646,much
647,274,2648,This palace certainly has a lot to explore. But you do not need to know the history because the buildings are magnificent without knowing the history.  There are a number of buildings to work around and a plethora of things to learn - if you are interested take a guide from the front and work slowly round each building.  The gardens look wonderful but we spent so much time wandering through the buildings that we ran out of time to investigate the 'Secret Gardens'.,647,much
648,275,2649,"The size of the palace is impressive, and if you take into account that the secret gardens are also part of it, you will definitely have things to see for a couple of hours. We did not visit the secret garden, because the reviews said that it's not the typical garden full of flowers. And we thought that we pretty much saw the korean style garden around the palace itself. However we also visited the Changgyeong palace, which you can get to from inside this palace (entrance next to the meeting point for the secret garden). From there we headed to the Jongmyo shrine, which was about a 15 minute walk. Besides its size, I personally didn't find anything outstanding about this palace. I have seen other asian palaces which were much more adorned - I honestly expected more design (inside and outside) that what it actually had. However the buildings are well maintained and the surrounding area / park is clean. The place is very dusty, so by the end of your visit you will most likely have to clean your shoes.",648,much
649,276,2651,"There are about 5 palaces around Seoul. Read up on them, pick carefully, and go to some, BUT NOT ALL as much is replicated. For a deeper insight into them, take a guided tour at one, but no more.",649,much
650,277,2661,"We very much enjoyed our visit to Changdeokgung Palace but more so our guided Secret Garden tour. We used the handbook that was given to us at the ticket office to self guide our way around the Palace, we probably only spent one hour wandering around before our secret garden tour. On the day of our visit there would have been around 50 people in our tour, the guide managed the number very well, waiting in most instances for everyone to catch up when walking from one site to another.  The tour lasts 1 hour and 40 minute, apparently Autumn is the best time of year to visit per the guide, but we very much enjoyed what nature had on offer, the cherry blossoms were out, and that's a nice thing. The secret garden was built for the sole use of the royal family in Joseon Dynasty, even today it is a peaceful place in a busy city. The water features are not as stunning as they would have been in the 1400s when they were designed, due to the growth of the city, so one can only imagine what is was like back then. There is a lot of walking on the tour, some steep hills and stairs to navigate, it is surprising how unfit most people were in our tour, young and old, and they would lag behind, but the tour seems to accommodate this.  As we were staying in downtown Seoul we were able to walk from our hotel to the Palace. I had reserved our places for the tour online the night before, but never needed to show my reservation number at the ticket office as they were plenty of tickets available on the day.",650,much
651,278,2670,"We visited this palace and enjoyed it. However, don't expect to see much, as it's a replica (most burned either during the 1910 occupation, WWII or the Korean war) and there is literally no furniture par a bed and a throne to see. The gardens are probably the biggest asset. We didn't visit those as you need to follow a guided tour and that didn't fit our schedule.",651,much
652,279,2674,"A visit here will make for a pleasant hour or two of your day. There's not much to see except for lovely old buildings and gardens, so it's not mentally exhausting like a museum -- more like a walk in a World Heritage park.  Tours of the Palace and Secret Garden are offered in English at 11:30 and 14:30 (closed Mondays). There are tours offered in other languages at different times, but I'm sorry I can't remember them all. You must be on a tour to enter the Secret Garden, but you don't need it for the Palace. If you choose not to take a tour of the Palace grounds, make sure you grab one of the little green information booklets (free) from the entrance gate, as there isn't much signage to tell you what you're looking at.",652,much
653,280,2687,"If you are debating which palace to go to (because there are just so many in Seoul), this one is the best to see in Spring because of its beautiful gardens. Make sure you go earlier in the day if you go because sometimes the garden tours close pretty early. I would say however that the garden tour isn't much to see in summer (there aren't any real colors...just lots of trees). I have gone to the palaces every season except winter and spring is best for the garden but fall could come in a very close seconds. It's all personal preference. This palace also ""connects"" to another palace area so you could wipe out two birds with one stone by going to see this one instead.",653,much
654,281,2693,"We visited early in the morning, not knowing the tour schedules. I remember enjoying the early morning walk with the chilly autumn air and the misty almost empty streets until we came to the gate of the palace, which I thought was*the* palace at first since it was so large.  We spent about an hour touring the place by ourselves and mingled with the other tourists reading the brochures and the markers until it was finally time for the English guided tour at 10.30 a.m.  There were actually many tourists around, most of them I think were Japanese or Korean, but the place was so large that the compound never felt full, it seemed rather empty even!  We were glad we joined the guided tour. There are much more fascinating facts to be learned about the buildings and the comings and goings of the Joseon dynasty members that we didn't find out just by reading the brochure or palace markers.  We didn't get to visit all the palaces in Seoul, but we were definitely glad we visited this one. Truly a beautiful and historical site.  If you are going there, wear comfortable shoes and prepare to walk a lot. The compound is big and will take about two hours worth of walking to explore sufficiently (not fully, I think you'd need a day or two for that). And don't miss the tour of the Secret Garden near the back area of the palace! This requires a separate entrance fee and has a different tour schedule.",654,much
655,282,2696,"The location of the palace is very easy to get to: you can either take the Seoul City tour bus and stop here, or you can take the metro and alight at the station (there are signs in the subway that will direct you to which exit is closest).  There's always a line outside so be mindful of the crowds. There's an entrance fee, and you can purchase a ticket from a booth located outside the main gates. You can also opt for an English tour, which only goes for certain times in the day (we chose the 11 am slot). The tour doesn't start on time because the guide wants to get as much of the English-speaking people together as possible (there was only one person doing the tour for about 20 people). This particular tour goes on for around two hours and only covers the palace grounds; you'll have to purchase another ticket for the Secret Garden tour, which only goes in the afternoon (in my case it had been around 2 pm).  Because we were so many, it was hard to hear the guide speak. She was dressed in a bright and colorful Hanbok (I think so it's easier for us to spot her) and brought around a small microphone but we still strained to hear what she was talking about. She also had a folder with pictures of things so we had a visual of stuff she talked about. You can ask her questions if you misheard something or would like to learn more, but I recommend you do this aside so it doesn't prolong everyone. It's very scripted and impersonal. In every station she allots a few minutes so you can take pictures or explore the area on your own before moving on. As I mentioned earlier, this was just a tour of the main palace, so she took us to the sleeping quarters, the library, the ritual house, the kitchens, the receiving area, the bridge, etc. On the day that we went it wasn't crowded so we were able to take photos without random people in it.  The tour of the Secret Garden was the highlight of this experience. You buy a separate ticket and can opt for the English tour as well, but others just choose to walk the course by themselves (which eventually you will do because the place will absorb you). The grounds are MASSIVE. The emperor had it right having a whole freaking park as his backyard. He and the crown prince had their own libraries, and plenty of pavilions that allowed you a view of, say, the lake from different angles. The buildings are pretty far from each other (you will mostly just walk) because they go with the natural flow of the mountain. Our tour guide (dressed in the same bright Hanbok and armed with the same tiny mic) was a little scary because she looked like she was having a bad day. She wasn't very open to questions and those she did answer she returned with monosyllables and a glare. Her pace is just right, allowing maybe 7 minutes per station (including photo-taking), and she keeps reminding you that you can go off by yourself and never get lost as long as you follow the paved path. I should mention that before you start the tour, you should head to the bathroom because there are no others in the area save for the one at the souvenir shop near the entrance. You should also bring an umbrella along during their rainy season, because chances are it WILL rain and there is nowhere you can seek shelter. Also bring a water bottle because it is a long walk and you may get thirsty along the way.  They have justifiably named this a world heritage site, and you cannot pass this up when you come to Seoul.",655,much
656,283,2704,"Seoul was made the capital city of Korea over six centuries back by the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). It was the last Dynasty to rule Korea before that country was taken over by Japan. Korea became independent again only after Japan's defeat in World War II - only to be divided between the democratic South and the Communist North. Today, The South is a showpiece liberal democracy, while the North has the most repressive regime anywhere.  The Gyeongbokgung Palace (gung means palace) is the oldest and largest palace to be built by that dynasty, with the huge main building having an imposing Korean-style double roof. Visitors can have themselves pictured with the ""Royal Guards"", dressed in colourful peroid costumes, and carrying weapons of their times. On my last day in Seoul, I was fortunate to witness a detailed religious ceremony featuring numerous priests, singers and dancers, all in colourful period costumes. It was living history at its best. (Admission Won 3,000, Tuesdays closed). On the palace grounds are the excellent National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum of Korea (entry free, closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, respectively).  The Changdeokgung Palace, set up later, became the favourite residence of later Joseon Dynasty Kings, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It has numerous wooden buildings, esthetically painted, and displaying an understated elegance. Korean palaces are very different from the ostentatious palaces of Western Europe. The attached Huwon Garden is a beautiful example of Joseon-period garden architecture. The King and his people would stroll around the lotus pond and even discuss matters of state there. (Admission Won 3,000, closed on Mondays. Tour of garden Won 5,000 more)..  Right next to it is the smaller Changgyeonggung Palace, built as the residence of three dowager Queens. It is also worth a visit. The Deoksugung and Gyeonghuigung Palaces are much smaller still, and less important.  Tourists should preferably visit only the first two palaces mentioned above, and the Jongmyo Shrine - the Royal ancestrial shrine of the Joseon Dynasty, located nearby..  Seoul is so rich in historical and cultural attractions, world-class museums and art galleries, and classical music and dance performances, that my ten-day itinerary was inadequate to cover even half of it. It is a dream destination.",656,much
657,284,2709,"Not much different than the first palace except for its 'Secret Garden'. I am sure that this garden is lovely but between the frozen ponds, barren trees and lack of all color except for brown and white, it was somewhat hard to imagine. Hope to see yourself..",657,much

659,1,198,The palace has nothing special but is good for the Korean Traditional dress called Hanbok experience and photos.  Just accors the road ( opposite to this palace) there is a shop for Traditional dress rental. They charge around kRW 15000 for 2 hours rental for dress. They provide all facilities like rentals lockers within this price. Ladies hair dress is additional KRW 5000. Overall a good experience to go for this.  Please also note that in case you are wearing the Traditional clothes the entry fee to palace is waived off.  The place is easily accessible through public transport.  The palace may be hot is summer and mostly uncovered in case of rain. So better carry an umbrella in summary or rainy season.  No F&B option in palace. Better to carry your water bottles.  They have washroom inside.,659,nothing
660,2,255,This is a great place to visit lots of history right in front of you perfectly preserved for tourists and Koreans who want to visit the local palaces. There are many palaces in Seoul but this is a very nice one which really is nicely preserved and is super easy to navigate though. There paths are not good for people with mobility issues and I don’t think you could get a wheelchair in here. There is very little share and there is nothing in the palace to drink so make sure you bring water along.  Great for all members of the family of all ages. Get yourself a hanbok and have a really traditional experience,660,nothing
661,3,291,"Caveat to this review is I’ve likely seen too many palaces over the years, and nothing in this one stands out. What also detracts from the experience is that all the buildings were only built within the last 150 years as the originals were destroyed. So you are seeing fairly modern materials and construction techniques. It feels a bit staged as a result.  If you’re short on time and have seen an Asian palace before then you can afford to skip this one.  Final point: ‘the secret garden’ can only be accessed via the scheduled tours, which appear to depart every 2 hours. I didn’t do it.",661,nothing

I heard tickets are hard to get (especially during Autumn foliage season) and can get sold out as fast as within the first 10min the system is open for booking.  Our guide was entertaining and shared many stories about the royalties, as well as the palace architecture. Now I understand why some of the doors are built so low...  The pace of the tour was relaxing. There were some steps (upslope) towards the end but nothing difficult. I don’t consider myself fit and/or athletic, but I had no problems keeping up with the group. My two little kids managed very well too!  You may want to visit the loo before the tour. There is only one toilet break during the 90min tour. No outside food and drinks allowed.

I also booked a tour to the secret garden (I booked it 4 days in advance) but I wouldn't recommend it in winter or early march/april.

But I am glad I did it. This is my 3rd palace for the week. And though I missed the glorious autumn leaves (I was rewarded at Deoksugung), this palace is not a UNESCO heritage site for nothing. It is the grandest of the 3 palaces I visited (the other being Gyeonbokgung) and it suitably named as a palace. The Korean Tourist Office has done a wonderful job managing my expectations that it is not as grand as China's.  This palace has the history and grandeur. Our guide was the best guide of all the tours I had. She speaks English with an American accent and it was easy to understand her.  As my tour ends at 11:25pm, I rushed to the Secret Garden's English Tour which starts at 11:30am. Trust me, it was super freezing and I was having second thoughts. Especially when our guide was warning as of the long walk and steps. Then I looked around. There are folks with strollers! I have to press on !! One-third through the tour, at this beautiful part with the pond & the pavilion is.......it started to snow !! Magical !! And the snow got heavier & heavier. I'd never forget this special moment! The last time I experienced this, it was in Nikko Japan, and that was about 10 years ago!  So it you are only in Seoul for a short time, and have to choose ONE to go.....this is the one. It was too cold for me to linger around after the cold. So I hurried back to get my umbrella and to watch to snow falling out of my window before catching authentic lunch at a hanok.  If you are in the area, end your tour with lunch at Gung Hanjeogsik. You need to cross the right traffic light, coming out from main entrance. Walk straight down the first road, then turn left. It's not easy to find, but worth it! I have come to realised, this trip, that having many reviews in TA on a particular restaurant is not necessarily the best. It could have been overly commercialised. It's super! And if you want stretch your visit to this area more, visit the",677,nothing

It was early Spring time and the flowers hasn't bloomed so the secret garden wasn't at its prettiest. The place is very mystical, scenic and calming, ZEN.

Most beautiful trees with red leaves mixing other pine trees were all bald at winter time, so it not as colourful as it is in pictures shot in autumn.

We attempted to pay fee for the secret garden which must be entered with a tour guide but unfortunately one only time with a chinese tour guide on sunday, for the whole day, can you imagine how interested it can be. The palace charge extra money to enter the secret garden but the service is so limited and travellers take so much time to go there. Tour guides in English is also limited. And I did not think I saw any timetable for the secret garden at the main entrance, may be it is a little secret that should not tell travellers. The ticket seller, probably has limited english ability and will just answer the money you need to pay but nothing else.

The garden was really interesting and beautiful but understand you'll be walking uphill a lot and can only go during a tour. They don't allow people to wander around by themselves. I dislike tours groups but there was nothing I could do. If you have a lot of time to sightsee around Seoul, try all the palaces. If your time is limited, pick either this one or gyeongbukgung (which is a few blocks away)...it's not worth cramming both into one trip to Seoul. IMO, I would pick gyeongbukgung since you also have the option of visiting 2 museums on the palace grounds as well as lockers to stash your bags. Also #5 line lets you out right under the entrance.",685,nothing

The entrance is a massive gate adorned with colourful patterns and carvings on wood. Ticket is very reasonable especially if you buy the combination ticket for the five grand palaces of Seoul. This ticket includes the secret garden in this palace as well which I recommend you to see but once you reach the pavilion with the pond where the souvenir shop is you may stop there because the rest will be a long walk with tree lined uphill path and some more pavilion, nothing else. The Injeongjeon Hall is the throne hall of the palace. There are also small buildings which good picture backgrounds with less people like the Huijeongdang Hall.

The palace doesn't seem as grandiose as the Gyeongbokgung palace but I couldn't believe how much more there was to the grounds. We explored on our first and then waited for an English speaking tour to pass and then hopped on. We had to pass time before our secret garden tour.

689,31,1679,"I am a history major, and I usually love these historical attractions, but I couldn't have been less interested with this palace. Maybe, its because I live in China and have seen structures like this before that I just really thought this attraction was not that interesting.  It wasn't really that old, as many buildings were rebuilt many times. The buildings had nothing inside, so they seemed just like empty shells. Much of the ground was just gravel, thus lifeless. Finally, there were only general descriptions of a couple areas, not descriptions for each building. Basically, there was no narrative to the entire place. If compared to similar buildings in China, there is no comparison. Even though the buildings in China are usually tourist traps, they tell you a story. For me that is important  One thing I can say about the place is that it is really cheap. My wife and I paid 6,000 won to get into both of the eastern palaces. That's basically six US dollars.  It is good to see the history of Korea in the Joseon palaces, but don't waste more than a morning on them.",689,nothing

It is not really what you would normally consider a garden at all. But each garden area is very nicely done and has traditional buildings. A guided tour must be purchased separately for the garden.  The palace itself is good to quickly look around. But nothing new if you have seen other palaces.

Going completely solo and taking a decent amount of pictures it took me about 45 minutes to see the palace grounds (which was a bit rushed) and still make my Secret Garden tour. Make sure you arrive a few minutes early - they limit the size of the tour group! Some people ended up getting bounced to a tour 30 minutes later just because they strolled up on time rather than 5-7 minutes early.  The Secret Garden is great to see, but in March nothing is yet in bloom so 90 minutes can feel a bit long. Still, the guides are good and speak excellent English.",691,nothing

I was looking forward to the tour with great anticipation, as it is only offered to foreigners six nights a year, with a limit of 100 tickets per night. I made a special point to be online and order tickets the minute they went on sale, that's how much I wanted to take this tour.  The tour was offered in English, Chinese, and Japanese, and attendees were divided into groups accordingly. That part was good. I expected the pathways, buildings and garden to be illuminated (not brightly so as to recreate daytime, but at least so that we could see what we were being shown) but sadly, this was not the case. A small number of attendees were asked to carry paper lanterns as we walked the grounds, and there were a few lights on the buildings, but I couldn't really see much. The pathways were unlit (the few paper lanterns scattered about were ineffective), and the ground is quite uneven, with random obstacles on the path (something which looked like pipe vents, at one point there was something that looked like an empty concrete pond, completely unlit, which someone could easily have tripped into), and we were marched from building to building very quickly. There was a lot of hiking up stairs and then down stairs, all stone, all uneven, all unlit. What could have been a pleasant walking tour felt more like a march in the dark. We were ""treated"" to a tour of the rear ""secret"" garden but were unable to see anything - I mean absolutely nothing. So what was the point of taking us through the garden? I'm still not sure.  When we reached the pavilion at the end of the garden, there was one building which was beautifully lit, with a large (unlit) pond in front of it. A musician played a traditional Korean gayageum, and we got to sit and listen for about 10 minutes. This part of the tour was quite lovely.  Tea and traditional Korean sweets were part of the tour, but the tea was served in paper cups - take one as you walk past a table, and keep moving - and the sweets were handed to you in a (very nice) fabric bag. I didn't expect a formal tea ceremony, but I also didn't expect a paper cup. This was just one more disappointment.  From there we sat as an audience in front of a stage area, where we were treated to another lovely musical performance consisting of several different types of performances. This was the highlight of the tour. If this had not been included, my rating would have been ""poor"" rather than ""average."" After that, we had to walk about 15 minutes back to the entrance, with no guidance, minimal lighting, and, once again, hidden obstacles.  Cost: 30,000 won per person. I would not recommend it. Go in the daytime, walk at your own pace, and you will undoubtedly get much more enjoyment for much less money.",694,nothing

The tourguide's English was understandable and I believe we had a rather interesting time there.  Nonetheless, it has been a year since I last went (late review is late), and I can safely tell you that I recall nothing from my trip to the palace other than the fact I've been there. So, I suppose while it made for an interesting stop, it wasn't memorable.  Drop by the palace if you have time, and if you really want to be able to cross it off your list.

I don't really know how tickets for a garden could sell out... anyway... so you've got to go super early to get tickets for that! I think I went around midday and there were no tickets left.
