1,1,127,"There's a reason this place draws crowds (especially in the Spring time). It's a wonderful place to take a stroll, walk your dog, or just lie out and enjoy the short window of time when the sun isn't too strong and it's not too cold out.",1,crowds
2,2,129,"This is a place where the local youths hangout to eat, drink and chill out in general. We decided to come here to try the local fad - eating ramen noodles in the park.  First you have to go to the very crowded convenience store to get your ramen. Next, cook your noodles. The store provides every amenity that you will need for a hot bowl of noodles. Lastly, find a spot amongst the very crowded waterfront to eat!  This was a good experience to enjoy your food, people watch and seeing the world go by. However the crowds and noise will seriously turn you off.  Granted, this is a public location and we came on a Saturday but it was a bit turn off.  We also discovered to our amusement that there is a booth in the park. You can actually call to order food delivered to you and the delivery man will meet you at the booth.  It was an interesting one time experience, however we will not probably come back here again.",2,crowds
3,3,140,"Visited with 50+ school kids in the start of winter!! Clear, cold and stunning! A great place to hang out, ride bikes, walk the riverbank, play in the gardens among statues, gardens, paths and big lawned areas. Sculptures, fountains, stunning views of the city and bridges. Boats on the river were preparing for night cruises with christmas decorations and lights but the cafes happily served food and drinks to us all. Due ti the cold, there were not big crowds so we had the place pretty much to ourselves, however it can be crowded. Beautiful views up and down the river and across to the city, Definate stop in Seoul.",3,crowds

6,1,73,"This park is the best place to enjoy the view of Seoul along the Han-River. There are less facilities than Banpo area. But you who use public transportation can arrive this park easier than that and many skyscrapers with lights also makes you feel good(of course, you can have fun with using food delivery service).  고층 건물들에 의한 야경이 이곳을 다른 한강공원에 비해 보다 매력적인 곳으로 만든다고 생각합니다. 다만 반포 한강공원에 비해 전반적인 구성은 알차지 않다는 느낌이 듭니다.",6,area
7,2,83,"I would mainly tell people to get off at yeouinaru station, exit 1, to enjoy hangang park. It's right next to the river and has so many food trucks during the summer time. You could just grab a meal and a few beverages and sit there peacefully as long as you want. Try to go when the sun is setting so that the temperature will be cooler. This has been one of my favorite summer spots and I try to go every weekend during the summer to enjoy the area, people, and food.",7,area
8,3,87,"You actually forget that you are in the middle of a very large city. The park offers a long circuit path for walking or jogging, plenty of park benches where you can watch the world pass by. The echo area also has elevated decking paths where you can explore the flora in this area of Korea, with plenty of labels annotating the species of the various trees.",8,area
9,4,91,We went for the cherry blossoms and enjoyed the festivities. A good deal of effort went into making the event enjoyable for people of all ages and it seems like it would be a lovely area for a stroll at any time of year.,9,area
10,5,95,"This is a really nice riverside park of Hangang(Han River). Good to visit and chill. - Metro #5 Yeonaru is the closest station. It's also nice walking from Yeouido Station through Yeouido Park. - Since it's a huge area, riding a bicycle is really popular. - You can also try Eland Cruise. - It's very windy until March. Be prepared with enough clothes.",10,area
11,6,101,"It's a very nice place for picnic with friends, family or love ones. It's a good place to feel like ""Korean"" / local. On weekend, it will be very crowded. But all of the facilities are fully provided. You can rent the mat and tent for sitting and enjoy your picnic, rent the bicycles to ride around the area, buying food/ snacks. They also provide the clean toilets as well. You can see the nice scenery of Han river. It's better to arrive around late afternoon and spend time until the early night.",11,area
12,7,109,"I came here in 2015 during the spring and there were cherry blossoms everywhere. The park itself is beautifully located along the Han River and a nice spot to spend some time enjoying yourself or with friends/family. I loved the area so much that the next time I come (spring 2019), I have planned to stay at the Conrad Seoul to have a view and be in walking distance. Highly recommend.",12,area

14,9,134,Had a lovely time walking along the Han river in the sunshine. There are boat trips that leave from the area and you can also cycle along the paths (you can hire bikes too). We finished off our walk at the food court in the base of the Seoul 63 building since there aren't any places to eat on our stretch of the walk. It was quiet enough for our walk but I believe the park gets much busier in the late spring and autumn. We also went there for the International Fireworks festival and it was CRAZY busy! I imagine it will be the same in cherry blossom season...,14,area

16,11,146,"Its very large area for sightseeing, you should spend time more than 3 hrs with my map. Firstly, taking subway transportation to Yeouido station, heading to NorthWest and walk through Yeouido Park and taking photo with National Assembly. Turning back to Yeouido Hangang Park. After this route, I found the minimart(named Mini Stop) where the chicken shop is on 2nd floor. So nice and memorable nature treat in Seoul!",16,area
17,12,153,"We stayed a week in Seoul and that day we felt like getting a bit away from all the action downtown.  A quick subway ride brought us to this pleasant park right at the Han River. There are lots of locals, mostly school kids and students (at least on a weekday) roaming the area and not many tourists....which isn't a bad thing.  This park has quite a nice setting with some good city views and lots of space to walk, bike or relax. A bit SEOUL sign at the river is the perfect photo op.  There is a good number of small restaurants, mostly chicken & beer and a huge bike rental, if you feel like driving instead of walking, quite cheap even.  If you are here in spring you might get lucky to see the cherry blossoms....we just missed by only a few days. Well, a good reason to go back I guess. After this park you should also check out the nearby Yeouido Park with some nice strolls (and more cherry blossoms in season).  All in all a nice place to spend some time away from all the action.  Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile.",17,area
18,13,159,"I don't really recommend this part of Seoul. There is nothing interesting around this area, only a park where people can do exercise. Maybe during cherry blossom season, it would be more interesting. We visited this park as part of our walking tour and cruise at Han river",18,area

20,15,168,Though it was very crowded we loved every bit of this beautiful park. We visited this place once in evening and once during a sunny afternoon. Lots of food vendors selling amazing snacks and accessories.

21,16,170,"Overlooked by the spectacular gold 63 City building, Yeouido Hangang Park is a pleasant place to spend a few hours. The park meanders beside the Hangang River and crossed by a number of bridges from northern Seoul, is easily reached by taxi, bus or subway. The park has playgrounds scattered along the shore making entertaining children a little easier. Bike rentals near the restaurants and wharf area allow the option of a bike ride along both sides of the river. For those less interested in bike riding, cruises leave the wharf and ply north and south of their starting point. Cruise times vary. Highlight of one of the cruises is the Banpo Bridge fountain which is best viewed in the evening when coloured lights illuminate the spectacle...",21,area
22,17,179,"Conveniently reached via Yeouinaru metro station (purple line) this park on the northern side of Yeouido island, fronting the Han river, provides a quiet escape from the concrete and human density of Seoul. I was there on a bright autumn weekday and it was virtually deserted. Some parts were clearly designed for events (thankfully none in progress), but follow the paths and you will be led to areas with wild grass and solitude.  There are great views across the river to the northern half of Seoul. Would also be a wonderful place to jog is you're so inclined.",22,area
23,18,180,"Lovely park. Although most trees were bare in winter, you can still see some with red autumn leaves.  There is a beautiful pond which is partially frozen.  The park is clean and great for walking. Toilets are clean too.  In fact there are two parks joined by a tunnel. One is nearer to the Han river, while the other part is nearer to the commercial area.  In the one nearer to the Commercial area (get down at National Assembly station), there is an ice park.  You can do ice skating (payable) or sledding (payable) or just play with the artificial snow(at the moment) for free.  Small food stalls are set up.",23,area
24,19,184,"I went here during Spring time and it's nice to see some Spring flowers in the area. You can just sit here to relax, have a picnic or do a bike stroll. It also has a good view of the Hangang river and the long bridge. This place is accessible from the train station.",24,area
25,20,188,"Nice for a picnic, or for your lunch break if you work in one of the skyscrapers nearby. Otherwise, there are some meadows, some trees, a river, a cafe, a small pagoda and so on- but nothing which is special to Korean culture. Nearby the river there are a few nice other spots, one can take a walk there.

27,22,204,"This is anothet park closed to the hotel I am staying. It's reall nice with great view over the river and city. Lot of people go there for picnic and cycling. There are washroom, playground, cruise. Should visit it if you are in the area.",27,area
28,23,218,"This park is huge and beautiful. I have been here on different occasions during different seasons with different people. One thing for sure, we have always enjoyed our trip there. I always have my annual winter vsit to this park just to give myself a short break fro the crazy schedule. It is always quite empty during winter so it feels like I have the park to myself. Watching the sunset while having a cup of coffee in a cafe which faces the river is perfect. During fall and spring, picnic is something not uncommon especially among locals. Go for a bike ride or just sit down and enjoy your time with family and friends. Either way it will be a fun day for you. I always avoid going to the cherry blossom festivals because it will be too packed with people. Instead I would suggest going several days earlier or well a day or two earlier would be fine too as most trees will be blooming by then and it won't be as pack as during the festival period. Sometimes, there are also performances at the main park area. So just sit back, relax and enjoy the scenery and time with your loved ones.",28,area
29,24,237,"I was lucky enough to visit Yeouido to meet a friend who works for Hyundai and it was such a beautiful area. It was also a little bit of a shock for me as I visited Yeouido which is mostly business people, politicians and police before going to Itaewon which is the foreign district. I didn't see any other foreigner whilst I was in Yeouido and I think several people were surprised to see me there.  Yeouido itself has many tall buildings with lots of glass fronting. The style of the buildings is very western and far away from traditional korean architecture. There's also the parliament building there with many protests happening on a daily basis. I saw at least 4 police coaches whilst I was there and as I passed they were deploying towards the protests.  The park is absolutely beautiful and much needed there. It was thriving with people taking part in some sort of game show, as well as office workers and elderly people getting excercise.  There's a large soft track that spands the outskirt of the park and several toilet facilities. In the centre of the park there's an astro-turf/basketball area with plane statue. There's also a nature reserve with a small stream and wooden paths you can walk along so you don't distrurb the animals. I only saw many plants and some birds but it was so quiet and serene. I was surprised that they'd made wheelchair access to the paths with areas along the path to move a wheelchair into should the user need a rest.",29,area
30,25,240,"regardless it's day time or night time, Koreans love to chill by the Hangang! It was comfortable and plenty of space to sit and relax, talk or even picnic. It's beautiful but you can try to search if there are any activities in the area otherwise it can be a little boring.",30,area
31,26,244,"I just so happen to be in the area during the cherry blossom season and it was beautiful. I also went back a little after the fact throughout my time in Seoul. Its a great place to ride your bike or go for a jog. If you are dating someone, you need to take them during the cherry blossom season. You just might get lucky, lol.",31,area
32,27,245,"This park is located on the south side of the Hangang river. It is a well maintained park with some kiosks for buying drinks or snacks. You can also opt for renting a bike at the park. Bikes are relatively small, but they work well in general. There's a biking trail in the park. But you can also leave the park and bike along the river Hangang. If you like biking and are a confident biker, this is what you should do in my opinion!There you'll find a nice walking and biking trail along the river. It's a great way to do some exercise and enjoy the views along the river. There are several resting areas and kiosks around. It can get very busy in the weekend. Enjoy!",32,area

Lots of native trees, grass and plants and flowers. Walking, biking trails, benches and tranquil view of the Han River. Take the metro, line 5, purple and when you exit the park is right in front of you. Hopefully if you are visiting and have the time between sightseeing and shopping, this is a great respite from the hectic Seoul.",34,area

37,32,265,"If you want somewhere pleasant and outdoors to hang out for a picnic in Seoul, this is a great place, particularly in the humid summer, when you'll appreciate the open space and the chance of a breeze. The Han is an impressively wide river, and is framed by the skyscrapers of Yeouido. There's a wide grassy area between the street and the river, so plenty of space to throw down a blanket, pop an bottle of wine, and chill out in the sun. Hangang park extends for miles in each direction, and is pretty much one giant cycle path, so if you have a bike, this is a great place to get exercise in peace and safety, without having to tackle the potential nightmare of cycling on the roads of central Seoul.",37,area
38,33,274,It was nice to see the older building preserved and restored. The shops and restaurants in the area were also interesting. It isn't hard to find and is worth the walk.,38,area
39,34,283,Long lanes to walk/Bike thru to see all the different areas of the park. A great place to bring a blanket and enjoy some sun on a patch of grass or a picnic with a S/O. Has areas to play basket ball or hold a stage for live music and a festival. I happened to be there on April 12th and it was the first day of the Cherry blossom festival.,39,area
40,35,300,Great timing as the Cherry Blossoms were in full bloom at the time of our visit. There are picnic areas all over the park and the view of the water is great. Take Line 5 (purple line) and get off at Yeouinaru.,40,area

43,2,104,"Very nice place to spend time with friends and family. We came on an afternoon, and people has already started their picnic.. it's even more merry in the evening as more people come. Bring your picnic mat or even rent the tents here! Pack your own food or skip the hassle by having one of the food delivery services offered. Cycling rental is available, clean and well maintained toilets. It's also interesting to just sit down and observe the people while overlooking the famous Han river. This place is definitely a venue to visit for a lovely korean-style picnic !",43,looking
44,3,157,I have been here once only - a nice place to visit in the early April. The park and the street is lined up with hundreds or thousands of cherry blossom trees. It is beautiful to stroll along the scented street or rest in the park. The upside of it is that it is really popular with the locals; so be prepared to be in the midst of thousands of people (during the Cherry blossom festival). I imagine the Park and the street with trees looking beautiful in the fall as well.,44,looking
45,4,174,"A vast open space with hardly anyone there. Well it was a chilly day in winter, looking at the reviews summer is when it all happens.",45,looking
46,5,212,"Great place to just chill be the river. We went to just have a snack and soju by the river but ended up renting bikes, a tandem and single coat for an hr was 9,000 won. About $8 US. Bikes were in good shape unlike some I've rented in different places. Super chill to ride along the river on wide sidewalks. There are bathrooms here and there and small convenience stores for whatever ya need. Some bring tents and hang out for hours and others just pass through. It's clean safe outdoors and would definitely recommend if you're looking to get outside and kill some time in Seoul!",46,looking
47,6,238,"If you've come all this way to Korea you'll want to find yourself something else to do because, as lovely as Yeouido Hangang Park may be, it doesn't deviate far from other average parks around the world. If you're a local looking for a relaxing time then by all means this park is more than decent. However, the disappointment of the city skyline - or a lack thereof - and you've got yourself a park that doesn't prove to be a good visit for tourists.",47,looking
48,7,270,"I walked to this park from Yeouido Park - and was impressed by the size of this park. Overlooking Hangang, you can go for a stroll, rent a bicycle, have a picnic, or simply sit anywhere in the park to admire the gorgeous city view and Gangbuk from this side of the city. With a good weather, I can only imagine how lovely it would be walking from one end to the other in this park at night - that will be in my list during my next visit for sure! :)  It's near to subway stations (Yeouinaru and Yeouido stations), cafes, stalls. Super clean.",48,looking
