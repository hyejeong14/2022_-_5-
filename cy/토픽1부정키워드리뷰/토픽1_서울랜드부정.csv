0,0,49,"definitely don't go here in the winter. even going in march is not a smart move. i nearly lost my face when going on the rollercoasters, not from screaming but rather the ghastly icy wind gushing at my face. should seriously rethink going to any amusement attractions during winter!",0,think
1,1,51,"I went to Seoul Land with my family. I think there's the amusement park part and the zoo part. We went to the zoo part. Actually we were planning to go to the amusement park but we went there by accident. Anyways, it didn't cost that much. There were many animals. It wasn't bad... I guess we had a good time.But I think I would go to the amusement park next time if I have a chance.",1,think
2,0,32,"Because of cold weather and small number of visitor, some rides are not operated. Parade and events were not lively compare to other season",2,small
3,1,48,"Just went there today with my 2 children aged 10 and 8. It's a pretty interesting park with an amusement park in one section, the zoo in another. Had already read the comments on the zoo and no one mentioned that entrance into the zoo required cash or a korean card. I wanted to buy a package that included the sky lift (which was awesome!) and tram and zoo entrance with my canadian credit card and they said that the zoo entrance fee could not be paid by my credit card. The tram and skylift were separate and went through ok. There was one ATM machine but it does not work with north american cards. Zoo was ok. Yes the enclosures seemed small compared to our zoos. I can't comment on the animals. We have a world renowned zoo at home and they were all doing the same thing...sleeping. We enjoyed our trip and would come back and join all the active seniors just to do the hike up the mountain! Unlike many public places in north america, the washrooms are super clean as are all the subways!",3,small
4,0,13,This amusement park is older and dated but it was still fun as there was not really any lines for any of the attractions. You will notice that many younger children or families go to this amusement park however it is still good for all ages as there are rides for children and those who are older.,4,old
5,1,20,"This is a outdoor theme park consist of different kind of themes for children. If you would like to have fun with your children, this is one of a good choose for you. But it is a bit cold in winter.",5,old
6,2,21,"Maybe this theme is old already or maybe I came during winter, or maybe combination of both. There is really very little people in this theme park. There is so little people that I believe because of it many of the rides is closed or seems closed. But if you approach the rides some of them is actually open and the staff will return and operate it. (they seems to be talking to other staff which also their rides have no guest riding it lol)  A little anti climax since the mood is so different from lotte world or everland, but a very good point here is that you can practically ride everything that is operating even if we came at noon time because there is no queues mostly. Only thing to note is many street food stall is closed so you have to eat at their restaurant, which is also empty, so don't come here on empty stomach.  Everything is old and such don't expect pretty stuff, but during winter, they have ice sledge which in my opinion is the most fun ride and worth coming. No waiting time, can play as much as you want, I will not grade this theme park higher or lower than everland, both are as good, just different expectations.",6,old
7,3,23,"This place is definitely for kids, probably younger than 6 or 7 years old. Rides are not exciting or thrilling at all. Boring.",7,old
8,4,24,"The place is so deserted and empty when we went on a weekday. Perhaps the rides are more suitable for younger children (5-12 years old) or its not as popular as the other 2 theme parks. Or maybe some of the rides are abit run down.  There are probably only less than 80 people during our visit and my kids can repeat the same ride 6 times without ridiculous queue. Mostly younger kids like 12-15 years old and lesser couples. They have a huge rollercoaster and drop down just like the popular theme park. Price is half compared to Lotte World when you purchase through KLOOK app. Super worth it and you need walk 3 mins after exit from train station to take the elephant ride to the theme park. Or walk to park in 15 mins.  There are restaurants, 7-11, cafes and 1 halal Kebab stall (near Tomorrow Land). For muslims, there is a dedicated musollah near 7-11, please ask the staff to open the door for you. Very clean and spacious with separate rooms, however we can't use the tap so its handy to bring a bottle of clean water.",8,old
9,5,28,"Multicultural families in Korea can get half-price yearly passes and foreigners visiting Korea can get great deals on tourist websites. Seoul Land is a bit tired and needs a bit of TLC, but there is plenty to do and the kids love it. My 6 and 7 year old can go on most rides. Parking is free during the week and the surrounding mountain views are really pretty. For a full day experience, combine Seoul Land with the Grand Park (zoo). We love the rollercoasters, flume ride and Larva Twister the most. Food and beverages are not too expensive and outside food is allowed in, if you prefer to have a picnic. There are lots of water fountains too.",9,old
10,6,29,"Very nice place. My family loves these old theme parks - nostalgic, not that crowded, not much queue and traditional rides.  Have been going to these old parks in Japan and continue to do so in Seoul.  There's a zoo in the same area if time permits too.",10,old
11,7,30,Although the facilities seems to be a lil old - it's still great. The rollercoasters are not that bad. Love the viking - felt more thrilling than the rollercoaster rides actually.  The view walking from the subway to Seoul Land is amazing and breathtaking - especially during sunset.,11,old
12,8,32,"Because of cold weather and small number of visitor, some rides are not operated. Parade and events were not lively compare to other season",12,old
13,9,38,"we visited Tokyo Disneyland, Seoul Land, and Lotte World on the same vacation (right, two countries) and my 6 year old son loved Seoul Land the most by far. the rides were great, versions of lots of classics for kids at every age (his problem with Disney, which is better for 10 year olds that are really into those characters). the cost wasn't high either, for entry or food, and lines weren't so bad (main rides lines could be long at times). they even had a kids play area so that we could get out of the rides and lines mode for awhile (a playground theme place, there was also a day-care indoor version we didn't use). it reminded me of the classic parks I visited as a child, kind of out of fashion in the US now since ever-bigger rides and commercial themes have taken over.",13,old
14,10,40,"We went on a Monday morning to avoid the crowd but surprised to find that the amusement park was quite deserted. My 2 kids have fun but some of the rides were not opened, don't know if it's due to the winter season. I find that most of the rides are more suitable for children of age 3-10 years old. We missed the snow sledding timing, a real pity as it looked fun!",14,old
15,11,41,This park looks older than Lotte World but it has a zoo there and less crowded. There are the usual roller coaster rides but some of them might be closed during the low peak season. There is a science museum opposite the park which can be an place to go after the park,15,old
16,12,43,"I came here on a date the day after Chuseok and there were a ton of people there! This is the oldest amusement park in South Korea, but it doesn't feel dated. I had more fun here than at Everland. There are more attractions and the energy in the place was more potent than I experienced at Everland and Lotte World. There is very little shade though...so go prepared with tons of water. The food options are traditional Korean food. For some reason I was expecting theme-park food.  After you have enjoyed your day here you can head over to Seoul Grand Park, which is another great location.  There is accommodation available if you want to stay in the area as well.",16,old
17,13,46,"We are a military family with a 9yr old and a 3yr old. First tip - take the subway.....if you don't read anything else in this review, remember this....take the subway. It's easy, inexpensive, drops you off right at the Seoul Grand Park entrance, and you do not deal with any traffic at all. So, we took the subway, exited the station and walked about 1/2 mile to the tram station. 2,700 won later, we boarded the tram and the 2nd stop is Seoul Land (1st stop is the zoo). The tram ride is one way, it will cost you another 2,700 won to take it back. TIp #2 - pay the won and take the tram or 1/2 your day will be walking to and from the entrance. I have no idea why, and the website said we would have to pay close to 120,000 won, but they charged us 45,000 and we could ride all of the rides until the park closed. The park is dated, but for $40 for the entire family, how can you beat it? There are 3 big roller coasters, a bungey jump, Free Fall (for anyone who has ever been to a 6 flags), and a few other rides intense enough to make you want to throw your breakfast up. Tip #3 - This is very important.....If you littlest one is over 100cm, I would seriously pass on this amusement park. Our littlest one is 101cm and they measured him off prior to every single ride. Thank God he busted 100cm or else it would have been a very long, disappointing trip. We went expecting Seoul Land, not Disney, and not Busch Gardens. If you go there wanting to have a really cool afternoon with your kids, there is more than enough rides for every age group. No, it's not huge. No it's not Busch Gardens. Yes, we had a great day with our kids, spent about 7 hours at the park, with absolutely no lines, no hassle, and a very friendly staff willing to go out of their way to make it a special day. Tip #4 - If you are a Westerner, you may want to stick to the burger restaurants, but there is fried chicken, and a Turkish booth selling Kebabs and Gyros. With the subway, the tickets, the tram, lunch, snacks, drinks, and even a few toys, we paid around 100,000 total for our family of 4, no kidding. Last and final tip - Go!",17,old
18,14,53,"Seoul Land is an old style theme park with somewhat antiquated rides and games. Very few activities available but for a day out of school on a field trip, it fits the bill. Have accompanied my children there on several occasions and have never been impressed. Tight parking spaces and no pre determined traffic flow caused unnecessary traffinc jams when it came time to go home. Not really recommended.",18,old
19,15,54,"Disclaimer: I have not been to Everland or Lotte World. However, as parks go, this was a great experience. First, mind the audience, which is for young people or families. Second, it is inexpensive. Third, it is an older park. Finally, the rides are more intense than their equivalent in the USA.  We went on a Tuesday when it was cool and school is in. There were a number of young kids there on school trips and they were the only ""crowd"" to be had. It was very sparsely populated. The temperatures and short lines were great.  We only paid 28,000 won for two people all day & all rides, though it was shown to be 32,000 per person for that ticket. That was a super deal and we got it at the counter. I don't know why. Additionally, the park food is very reasonably priced, just a smidge above street fair price.  The park was built prior to the Olympics in Seoul and most of the rides are meant for younger people; however, they are more intense than their equivalent in the states. The flying carpet, pirate ship, ""frontal spinning ride"", two roller coasters, etc., are all worth it. If you go on a cool day when most the crowds will be minimal, you will have a blast!",19,old
20,16,55,"My wife and I visited Seoul Land on Oct. 17, 2011. Having already been to Lotte World we were expecting something similar, but were disappointed. The park looks like a 40-year old Disney prototype that's been left to the elements for 5 years; there only seemed to be three rides intended for anyone over 6-7 years old. If in the area stick to the zoo, or if looking for an amusement park go to Everland or Lotte World.",20,old
