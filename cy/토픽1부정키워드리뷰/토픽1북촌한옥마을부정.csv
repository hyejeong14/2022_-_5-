2,2,109,This village is super chill and extremely photogenic but please remember to refrain from making too much noises as they are all houses with real humans staying inside Residents probably not paid by the tourism board of South Korea but some of them put on their thinking caps Paid for an observation deck with free water in it seems like a residents rooftop haha Whats funny is later on as we explore we found a better view with no charges,2,inside
3,3,143,A district with the largest number of traditional Korean houses. The houses are kept in good conditions and some are opened to public. Traditional Korean costumes can be hired from the shops for photo-taking on the streets and inside the houses. A reminder for visitors to avoid disturbing the residents there.,3,inside
4,4,160,"What a Lovely Neighborhood indeed. Very calmed place filled with little streets in between and tiny dead end streets. It can get annoying for a bit trying to go on each and everyone of these tinny streets, but soon enough you'll find out, that is not about getting somewhere, but the beauty that you can photograph at the end of each of these streets. Then you turn around and go on your way to the next. Kinda like this is a journey and not a destination; if I want to get all philosophical and stuff.  Therefore after you are done with the cute pictures, remain in the main street of this village and then start to build your way up. You'll find on your left and right side a multitude of nice little shops; we specially loved a tinny flower shop / coffee shop. Very subtle and calm inside, nice jazz music as a background and although South Koreans have the worst coffee to drink in the world; the small pastries kinda make up for this.  All in all and without too much mystery, it is worth to go and check one by one these little stores, where you will find also a very nice lady who makes and designs her own clothing (very luxurious and not cheap) but very much worth. Also there is a fine lady who designs her own silver jewelry, very well made and with a nice weight and surprisingly very affordable.  Please look at our pictures and find out what we are talking about. Beautiful street indeed and we had a lovely time. This is the kind of streets you need to look for in Seoul. The crowded Millennial streets will drive you nuts with cheap nasty food and cheap Chinese stuff that has no material and spiritual value whatsoever.",4,inside
5,5,198,"The architecture is beautiful, without a doubt. Looks new too, which I guess is expected because you don't expect a 600 years + building to still be standing without work done to restore it. I enjoyed walking in the less popular alleyways where I had the time and space to reflect upon the history of the people who lived here way before my time.  Now- these are also people's home and the many signs posted on the walls remind you this, and to be quiet. And even though no one said anything to me it reay felt voyueristic and sorta intrusive. (I saw 2 or so elderly women walk past tourists on the steps of their houses to get inside). I tried to imagine how I'd feel like if day in, day out, I had to contend with throngs of tourists taking pictures outside my house. I imagine during the warmer months, opening a window is neat impossible what with the hoarders of strangers milling about.  Should you go? Depends on you and what you feel comfortable with.",5,inside
6,6,203,"As u walk from the subway station towards Bukchon Hanok Village, look for the tourism ambassadors decked out in bright red uniform & hat. They will offer u a physical map and recommend a route for u to follow so that u will not be lost figuring out where to go inside Bukchon Hanok Village. The walking route is highly recommended as u get to see lots of stuff which u might miss if u cluelessly wander around.",6,inside
7,7,216,"not easy to find this place, as I walked and walked trying to look for this place. it is a village where people are living, so we dont really see inside of their house, is quite tiring too as this village is just a two rows of village",7,inside
8,8,259,"as this is still an actual residential area the inside of the house can’t be seen, but it is the interior + exteriors that makes the Hanok ever interesting ... fine other hanok villages that allow you to have a meal in it I.e onion cafe",8,inside
9,9,304,"The neighborhood has the largest collection of privately owned hanoks, or traditional Korean homes with tiled roofs, stone floors and amazing wooden doors, in Seoul. It’s located on in a hilly neighborhood nestled between Gyeongbok Palace and Changdeok Palace which are both walkable for this location. While I strolled through Bukchon Village up, down, back and forth it may feel like a trip through the ages, the neighborhood is not frozen in time. Some of the hanoks are still private homes, but others have been converted into tea houses, coffee shops. These are neat little places to get a look inside on of these beauties majority of them be historically updated renovations but they kept it to the err of time. I really enjoyed my time even while it rained.  Remember people still live here so a quiet ordinance is in place and is patrolled.",9,inside
10,10,308,"We spent so little time there in the morning, as we brought our parents. We visited a nice cafe inside that served delicious muffin and drinks.  Some of the routes are steep, and require good stamina. Heck, we just stayed for around 30 min walking and maybe another 30 in that cafe. We just had a couple of good photos (since we were all dressed in hanbok) and left.  Maybe if I travle with friends someday I will visit this village again, maybe even make a traditional stamps or two. But travelling as a family... I won't recommend this place.",10,inside
11,11,314,"Lovely neighborhood with privately owned hanoks. Start out at the Tradional Cultural Center and pick up a free detailed area map. The Cultural Center has restrooms and displays of typical hanok houses that you can peek inside. Shops and restaurants are along the way although on a Tuesday morning there did not seem to be many places open but the crowd was also sparse. Signage is good at helping one find the way. Some of the streets are steep. We took the metro getting off at Anguk Station, exit 3.",11,inside
12,12,374,This was part of a tour and it's lots of traditional houses in a specific part of Seoul. The houses are not open to the public and before you go you are asked not to make too much noise as its residential. There are people there with signs saying don't make too much noise. You really don't see the houses inside it's just the exterior and they are 100 years old it was interesting but I don't think I would make it my business to take time out to go there to see it specifically. It would be nice if one hone was on view.,12,inside
13,13,378,I'm kindda a history buff so having to experience walking along and inside the urban environment dating back 600 years ago was a chance not to be missed. The houses are so well maintained and beautiful to look at. Love it here!,13,inside
14,14,479,"Maybe because there were just too many tourists when we were there to take any nice photos. However, still interesting to know that these traditional houses actually have residents staying inside.",14,inside
15,15,489,"Just walk along the road deep inside the Village. You will find traditional Korean tea houses, restaurants, and item shops. However, be aware of the residents. They dislike too loud voice.",15,inside
16,16,491,"The village has nice traditional Korean houses. However, they are suffering from tourism. The houses are mostly occupied but families living in them. But tourists are not letting them live happily and with privacy. There are signs by the residents (see photos) indicating that they are suffering. There are signs on most doors asking people to not open doors/knock on them. There are also staff with yellow vests asking tourists to be quiet as they visit the village. Yet, I witnessed so many people talking loudly, knocking on doors and trying to go inside, and many other disturbing behaviors. This is unsustainable and unethical tourism. There are many other places in Korea where you can find that style of architecture. Do yourself and the village a favor and skip this place - let the locals live. I would’ve skipped if I was aware of this problem.",16,inside
17,17,492,Strolled through the village following a recommended walking tour provided by a tourist info center. Charming traditional houses. You could go inside a couple of them. Some areas with shopping & restaurants. Many people wandering about in traditional Korean dress added to the experience,17,inside
18,18,500,This is a residential area in Seoul and one should have that in mind when visiting the place. It is made of small private homes with history boasting 600 years. The houses are small made with wood and stone on a very peculiar architectural style. Some were turned into small restaurants and coffee shops giving you a chance to see the inside of the houses. Some locals wearing yellow jackets can help you through the narrow streets. The visit should not take long and it is definitely a spot you should not miss.,18,inside

20,20,552,"The village is located about 10-15 min walk from Anguk station. The station itself is one of the most artistic station I have ever visited in Seoul. I must say that the village is a good place to get to know Korean heritage through its traditional houses (you must know that some people still live inside those houses). There is this one house that you can enter so that you can experience living like a Korean. For those who loves learning about different culture, this is the place to be !",20,inside

If you'd like to explore the inside of houses, try not visit it in the evening because you can not go inside after 5 PM. Wearing hanbok while exploring the house will give you new experience of the real Korean village people.",22,inside
23,23,633,"Quite nice architecture but all doors are closed except for one or two which have been turned to shops. The street can be narrow and steep. I was surprised to see a banner that roughly says ‘No tourists please ‘ and no talking signs pasted on most doors. I guess people live inside these houses and the whole atmosphere is very quite except for those made by tourists. Despite the hot summer, some tourists are game enough to wear traditional dresses to take photos.😂",23,inside

25,25,707,"i love history and the houses here are just so beautiful. i want to get in to see how it look inside.  it is very tiring to go up and down the street. it is uphill and downhill.  there are many shop where you can buy clothes and everything.  restaurants and coffee shop not to get hungry.  when you are up you will be able to witness a beautiful view, just relax and enjoy",25,inside
26,26,731,"Our taxi dropped us off this 100 year old Korean exhibition house either a scenic overview of the Bukchon village, unfortunately we were not allowed inside the house because we were not with a guided tour. But fortunately they allowed us to enter & view the house from the garden -- to officially open in 2 months. This was a home of a Korean surgeon & now bought by the City of Seoul. Yes it's worth a visit then walk to G-Palace . Ginseng chicken soup Restaurant was our lunch stop in this area.",26,inside

28,28,785,"This is absolutely fantastic! Bukchon is a traditional Korean hanok village in the heart of Seoul. The hanok houses are so beautiful, and I couldn't stop taking photos. It is possible to go inside some of the houses, and you can also buy morning or afternoon tea and just enjoy the atmosphere of this amazing place. The streets are quite steep, but it is definitely worth making the effort to navigate your way through them. And you'll find some great views over Seoul too. I would highly recommend a visit to Bukchon.",28,inside
29,29,787,"been to this place the morning before our flight going back home (manila). though im satisfied seeing the hanok, but i would love to experience going inside and see how traditional houses were arranged. unfortunately, we were not able to follow the tour map and were not able to reach the highlight of the hanok village (where the abundant hanoks are located). dont forget to try a mango dessert at philippines dessert cafe. :)  how to get here? we took a train from myeongdong. the nearest subway station is Anguk (orange line, line 3). take exit 3, walk few meters and take left turn for Gyedong-gil (road/street).

They have couple of houses open to visitors to see inside.  It is only available to visit before sunset to give residence some privacy. The area outside the old village is also very interesting with cafe and restaurant', also very near to president residence.",30,inside
31,31,794,"Lots of traditional homes still preserved from the olden days. I went here on mid May and it was still chilly. So bring your jackets during any season. You have to walk a lot from the station and the place is quite hilly so sneakers are recommended. The neighborhoods are a mix of traditional and modern houses. People live inside. Lots of flowers blooming on early summer. The roads were quite narrow and scenic. Excellent for pictures. It was great cultural experience. If you don't care about culture, don't bother with it. You might find it Uninteresting.  I was very tired of walking towards the end of my journey there, so I rested in a Cafe And had some shaved ice cream with red bean paste and rice cake. The portion was big but still it was overpriced, in my opinion. Actually, everything in there is more pricey than anywhere else. It's a stylish little town. And I bet the merchants know tourists go there so it's expected, I guess.  Despite the cold weather and aching feet, I still really enjoyed my trip there. Definitely recommend!!!! ♡",31,inside
32,32,809,"actually, lots of this area is private are which is owned by citizen. but the government opens for public as a tourist destination. so, they suggest you not to make noisy sounds. you can see the typical of old style Korean house. my friend who was my guide said that this area is quite expensive. so, all the house might have expensive price. don't forget to take a map at the tourist information, because they give a direction how to explore this place. only few place in the Bukchon that have free entrance. if you want to see inside the house, you have to pay 10.000 won. if you want see all around Bukchon from 3rd fl., you have to pay also (but i forgot how much is it). i've found nothing special in here, just to improve knowledge about the Korean tradition. Bukchon is very near to Gyeongbokgung. so, after visit Gyeongbokgung, try to walk to find Bukchon.",32,inside
33,33,822,"A must visit in seoul, where the traditional old quarter situated in the middle of modern glitzy seoul. A comfortable stroll next to the palace and Insadong area.

34,34,829,"This area is full of little nice but surprising museums : chicken museum, embroidery museum, amulets museum. We even got the unplanned opportunity to learn how to paint on wood and get a tea ceremony. So don't hesitate to try some of those little museums , you never know what awaits you inside !",34,inside
35,35,853,This place was a little hard to find. The tourist info office was closed when we arrived at the area around 9am so we had to ask people in the street for directions. which is a bit of a task because few can speak english. It's a good place to see. We went inside a private house where the girl guide explained the traditions of Hanuk houses. (charged us 10000 won).,35,inside
36,36,854,This would be a good place to visit if you want to see the traditional houses of Korea. Most of these houses have people living in them so we had to make sure not to make too much noise while we were visiting the place. There was a couple of houses where they actually allowed you to go in and take pictures but I guess it's all up to the owners. There are museums and workshops inside too but we didn't manage to visit them all as we didn't have enough time. Would definitely come and explore more again if I had the time.,36,inside
37,37,857,Wish to visit the inside of the house rather than looking at the over from the roof tops. The free walking tour guide was very helpful.,37,inside

39,39,908,"In the beginning I must admit I was a bit worried. I'd seen all these beautiful pictures in korean travel guides but we couldn't find them when we arrived. There were bits and pieces of beautiful old houses here and there, but nothing that looked like a unified hanok village.  Luckily we were spotted by two wonderful red aproned volunteer tour guides, who gave us a map and pointed the way to the ""most famous view"" in the hanok village. They weren't wrong. It's a bit of an uphill climb, but when you get tot he top of a row of beautiful hanok houses and look down the street to see modern seoul framed in the distance, it really takes your breath away.  Some great waffle and coffee shops abound here. so make sure to sit down and take a break after the climb. One in particular is near the subway exit 3, and serves what is essentially a grilled sandwich shaped like a fish with your choice of savory or sweet ingredients inside.",39,inside

There are signs around asking you to not talk too loudly. There was one house which looked like a museum. You could go in to see what one of these houses look like inside and it was free entry.

56,56,1277,There are family inside the house so keep your big mouth. The government seems to keep this traditional house in the city. I believe the owner of the house is quite rich now because the have nice car and the automatic door complete with cctv around their house.

Do wear comfortable shoes though as there is alot of walking to do. You can also rent a hanbok for an hour or two to walk around the area. It's definitely worth a photo shoot. Also, you can visit the high school that was used for filming in Winter Sonata (yes, it's a long time drama, but still worth a visit. We all love Korean dramas don't we? :)).",62,inside
63,63,1485,"A place worth visiting as it consists history of village residential, truly fascinating when walking and climbing the steepness hill along the residential. They're people living in that village, though its name as a village, rather, more on very much developed small town as compared to my hometown.  There are a lot of steep climb along the residential area, I was just lucky because I've carry manfrotto along as had it setup steadily to avoid and beat the uneven road surface, gradient and etc.  Spotted one of the houses' walls stacked up by raw bricks inside the village, taking advantage to make use of this wall to do our couple shooting. Many tourists doing their own smartphones shooting too, they were laughing why the hassle where smartphone already sufficed for the photography. I don't blame them, indeed smartphones' quality could be very good for photography, just that maybe I am still old school fella who still doing photography in an old fashion way.",63,inside

We even made a stop where we went inside one of the homes that was on exhibit to show tourists the size of the inside of the houses l (which are tiny by the way-I don't know how people live like that). It was a very lovely walk through and lasted about an hour.

Looking back, that was certainly not a great idea. But we were clueless as to the availability of a guide anyway, so we didn't have much of a choice.  The traditional looking houses in the village appeared to have local residents living inside. So practically, this was a peek of the actual traditional Korean village.

There are signs along the narrow roads asking tourists to keep their voices down and no photos inside the residences out of respect the the privacy of the owners. A couple of the houses actually will give you a guided tour of the interior at a fee. We didn't do that, so just walked along the lanes and looked a the houses from the exterior. The neighbourhood is on a hillside and so a lot of places it's quite steep. You do get a good view at certain points though and there are some cute shops, cafes, and restaurants tucked in unexpected places. We happen upon a little cafe that was so cute. The shops etc. are not in the same area as the traditional houses though. We wandered beyond them but I couldn't say exactly in which direction.

This used to be a rundown and cramped lower middle class area which failed to draw attention by the destroy-anything-old syndrome of the 1970's and 80's building craze in Seoul. Most of the grand mansions down below on more habitable flat ground were long gone even before that period. Now there are only two homes worth mentioning in the area. One belonged to former President Yun--a 99-unit home in traditional Korean style. The other is at the summit of Bukchon--a genuine Victorian home. In any case, both homes are privately owned and not open to the public.  The small houses in Bukchon are also privately owned and are not possible to visit inside. Those few that are open to the public, you have to pay an entrance fee! Why on earth would anyone be interested in visiting a claustrophobic home that somehow avoided demolition decades ago? Bear in mind, they may be well-maintained now but are not homes built two, three centuries ago. It is shameful and embarrassing that there isn't a single area of grand old residential homes surviving in Seoul.

Anyway, bring comfy walking shoes as there are a lot of hills in the village. Bring a wide angle lens as well.",144,disappointed

We started the day touring the old Sejong Village and the Tongin Traditional Market on the other side of the palace, had late lunch then, walk around top of the Palace to the other side. We tried several pathways shortcuts into the Bukchon Hanok Village area; but not successful. Finally we had to walk down further and cut back in. The better way to the village is from the south end, subway station near the Japanese Embassy.",150,disappointed

My only mistake was not to plan to eat there. There're many little restaurants along the alleys, which I vow I will go back next time I visit. Although not many people speak English, the vendors graciously point seemingly lost tourist like myself in the right direction.  Definitely bring a good camera, if you love taking photo. I wish I have mine, but I have to content with my camera phone. Enjoy the exhibit at the visiting center; and read the history of the village at the front. Seeing modern shops w/in the well-preserved traditional structures was simply incredible. The pride of the community is hard to miss. You won't be disappointed.",152,disappointed
153,11,1814,"This district is very nice if you know where you're going, or if you have time to explore. It's not huge, but you might be disappointed. There is a famous street there, though, so make sure you see that one at least. The street goes uphill/downhill depending on where you are. Sometimes there are so many tourists there, so it might get a bit annoying. Bukchon is a walking distance from Gyeongbokgung palace (did I spell that right?). Also, sometimes people offer to let you inside one of their old houses there and give you a tour for a price. In my opinion, Bukchon is a must-see in Seoul. Not overwhelmingly fun, but just beautiful.",153,disappointed

158,16,2247,"We visited Bukchon Hanok Village while in Seoul. It was a highlight of our time there. We found that it was absolutely fascinating to walk through the narrow lanes and alleys of this neighborhood full of traditional Korean homes. Part of the appeal of this area is that this area is lived-in. It is NOT a museum, but a living, vibrant community. People take care of their homes and the streets and alleys are well-kept. Be ready to climb some steep stairs to get there, though. The 'village' is perched on hillsides and as you walk around, you get wonderful views of the village and the modern city off in the distance. If you're up for a strenuous walk and ready to climb flights of stairs to get into this village, you will not be disappointed with your effort. Come and see this memorable village for yourself.",158,disappointed

There were hardly any proper directional signs to lead us there and we had to ask along the way for pointers. When we arrived, instead of seeing hanok, we were greeted by a changing landscape of modern houses mixed with whatever is left of hanoks. What remained were converted to guests house.",159,disappointed
160,18,2554,we were soooooo disappointed in visiting this place. going up is a challenge then when you reach the village all we can say is.. is that it!!!??!!?? i thought i could see the traditional old houses. not worth it! better look for other place to visit,160,disappointed

162,20,2649,"I saw a lot of beautiful photos of Bukchon Traditional Homes so I expected a lot. But I was a bit disappointed as not did we walk way far from the metro station, but it was a steep climb up as well to reach the actual houses. They were awesome yes, but you can only take photos outside. Map was a bit confusing to us and there were no helpful signs along the way.",162,disappointed
163,21,2741,"We spent an hour here just wandering about and having lunch after we visited Gyeongbokgung. It was easy to get here and once you are on the main road you are immediately surrounded by lots of other tourists. The first tourist information booth we saw gave us a walking map which we followed. This was as good a way as any to see the area and get some scenic photo shots. Since we were there on a Sunday, most of the shops/houses that were not on the main road were closed. I was a bit disappointed by the whole thing since it didn't really feel like an 'old town' (in the European sense at least) but DH was very keen to get the photo and video shots so it was worth it for that. Overall, the area is overun by tourists all doing the same thing (heading for photo spots to snap away). If you like that kind of shopping it appeared to have lots of small boutique like shops around the main road which my teenage daughter found quite interesting. Otherwise, it lends itself to just walking around aimlessly taking in the atmosphere. Since it is located right between two palaces, it also makes for a good 'bridging attraction' between the two. Just don't underestimate (like we did) how long it can take to visit Gyeokbokgung. By the time we finished there, looked around Bukchon and had lunch we had missed the timing for the English tour at Changdeokgung.",163,disappointed
164,22,2763,"Entering Bukchon I was initially disappointed. It is a western influenced part of town owing to the wealth there. After passing umpteen coffee and waffle shops along a street with obvious European influence, we moved up the hill. There the residential quiet along with the gorgeous views of the city and the fall colors took over. The actual ""traditional houses"" are largely either renovated or reconstructed to look old, but they are charming, especially when you come across a lane of them together. When there isn't a tour group or a late model luxury sedan nearby, you can almost imagine what the area might have been like for a rich Seoulite a century ago.",164,disappointed

This area is really the sort of place where you can wander around for a couple of hours and just get lost in the maze of streets. One thing I was disappointed with was the advertised Bukchon Hanok lookout... it was at the top of a persons' house on their balcony and was around 5000 Won. Not worth it! There is another panoramic view you can check out not far from there, it's just a little lower, that's all.",165,disappointed
166,0,14,I nice place to visit a short walk from Seoul Royal Palace Gyeongbokgung There isnt much but still quite worth seeing  To get to the main photogenic spot keep walking straight into the alley from the map marker where you go quite a bit up hill Theres also maps around the area that guide you though a route through multiple villages in the same area if you wish to see more  Theres a traditional dress both men and women rental shop down the road from the entrance to the alley which is quite a popular thing for tourists to do,166,much

170,4,82,In the end a little disappointing compared to what I expected We dont see much because the houses are behind fairly high walls The streets are crowded with tourists taking selfies Moreover even the inhabitants are fed up see the posters asking tourists not to make noise not to enter the gardens  The houses are certainly very beautiful but in the end only 2 3 streets are interesting and allow you to admire the roofs and the walls,170,much

177,11,160,"What a Lovely Neighborhood indeed. Very calmed place filled with little streets in between and tiny dead end streets. It can get annoying for a bit trying to go on each and everyone of these tinny streets, but soon enough you'll find out, that is not about getting somewhere, but the beauty that you can photograph at the end of each of these streets. Then you turn around and go on your way to the next. Kinda like this is a journey and not a destination; if I want to get all philosophical and stuff.  Therefore after you are done with the cute pictures, remain in the main street of this village and then start to build your way up. You'll find on your left and right side a multitude of nice little shops; we specially loved a tinny flower shop / coffee shop. Very subtle and calm inside, nice jazz music as a background and although South Koreans have the worst coffee to drink in the world; the small pastries kinda make up for this.  All in all and without too much mystery, it is worth to go and check one by one these little stores, where you will find also a very nice lady who makes and designs her own clothing (very luxurious and not cheap) but very much worth. Also there is a fine lady who designs her own silver jewelry, very well made and with a nice weight and surprisingly very affordable.  Please look at our pictures and find out what we are talking about. Beautiful street indeed and we had a lovely time. This is the kind of streets you need to look for in Seoul. The crowded Millennial streets will drive you nuts with cheap nasty food and cheap Chinese stuff that has no material and spiritual value whatsoever.",177,much

It mainly consists of narrow lane ways edged with new and some older style houses, it is somewhat lacking in authenticity. You will mainly see roofs but the occasional house is visible. Many houses are now coffee shops or boutiques. When travelling around Seoul, if you keep your eyes open you will see much more genuine examples of older style Korean houses. This is the most disappointing Korean attraction I have come across. Perhaps it is worth a look if you are visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace as it is close by.

The buildings are styled in the traditional sense but they are mixed between modern apartments and houses. There is really only one street with the same style of housing and the sight of air conditioners, wiring and hot water services detracts from the traditional aspect. There are attendants at each end of the street holding signs asking people not to make noise as this disturbs the residents. There are a few souvenirs shops and some very modern cafes in the village.

You really don't see the houses inside it's just the exterior and they are 100 years old it was interesting but I don't think I would make it my business to take time out to go there to see it specifically.

They would be better called “If you walk in and around this general perimeter we’ve laid out, you’ll see Bukchon”. Go to the “Images” option of most search engines and type in “Bukchon”, you’ll find alternative, much more detailed (and perhaps better) walking route maps.  Get an early start (getting to Bukchon by 8:00 – 8:30 A.M. is recommended). The area is surprisingly small and the streets very narrow. By 10:00, it’ll start to fill up with mini tour groups and other tourists with cameras to the point that any pictures you take will be mostly of other people taking pictures. This is especially true for the north-west section of Bukchon. [If it’s just you and the occasional resident walking their dog or walking to school, you’ll know you’re there at the right time]. If you’re staying close by, it might be a good idea to visit it until crowds start to show up, then leave and pick up where you left of the next day.  Finally, not to be preachy but keep in mind that you are, for all intents and purposes, in these people’s front and back yards.",217,much

The traditional houses are built closely-knitted and you wonder how it feels to live so close to your neighbours but I got a chance to step into a open house and surprisingly the internal compound was very surreal, cooling, private and cosy. On top of the traditional houses, there are plenty of quaint shops to keep your eyes and wallets busy. My girlfriend and I enjoyed our first trip there so much that we visited again during our 8-day stay in Seoul. On a good cool day, you can leisurely walk from Gyeongbukgong Palace to Bukchon. A must visit place.",221,much

We had a free walking tour from the Korea Visit Org (highly recommended, the guides speak good English and are very friendly -- plus it's free) and it was enjoyable.  Only thing is the entire walk can be very tiring, especially the uphill areas. My two elderly companions didn't enjoy it as much because of all the walking. Wear good shoes, maybe trim your itinerary a bit if you're short on time. This is a place best made for slower walks and absorbing the scenery.",223,much

There are some really fantastic views of the city from this area as well; so, it makes for some perfect photo ops as well.  Some of the hanoks have been turned into tea rooms, museums, and art galleries. This would be pretty much the only way you could view the interior of one of these historic homes; because the rest are still private residences.  Go when the weather is fine and you have a few hours to stroll.",225,much

235,69,854,This would be a good place to visit if you want to see the traditional houses of Korea. Most of these houses have people living in them so we had to make sure not to make too much noise while we were visiting the place. There was a couple of houses where they actually allowed you to go in and take pictures but I guess it's all up to the owners. There are museums and workshops inside too but we didn't manage to visit them all as we didn't have enough time. Would definitely come and explore more again if I had the time.,235,much
236,70,871,"I read some of the reviews wondering what people expected to see and why they were so negative. Bukchon is a gem: it is extraordinary in a city where anything built per-1980 is ""old"". Several hundred single storey houses in a tight little area in a city where real estate prices are sky high and the pressure to develop is intense is a testament to a combination of good fortune and enlightened government. A stroll through Bukchon is delightful and there is always the opportunity to dive into a gallery or coffee shop if the slight climb to the top Is too much effort. It is no wonder that film crews are regularly found preparing their scenes for Seoul-based soaps.  I imagine many reviewers go on package tours. That is a mistake in Seoul - everything is so accessible and the delight is coming across little lanes almost by accident. So it is with Bukchon. All you have to do is walk between the palaces (less than a kilometre) and you are then in the midst of a wonderful example of modernity embracing a piece of history.",236,much
237,71,873,"Bukcheon is supposed to be Seoul's old historic quarter and while it still does have a few quaint Korean-style houses (hanog) to see (which, incidentally, are much prettier than traditional homes in, say, Japan), the folks here have been very inconsistent at keeping their historic archictecture, if they ever tried to at all, so the hanog, even in this most historic part of town, come interspersed with thoroughly modern functional buildings -nothing even close to the solidly historic neighbourhoods of many European cities. One of the hanog I saw sported a mass of barbed wire all over the garden wall, which was not exactly a pleasure to look at. Still, it is a precious piece of heritage as all the other historic architecture (the very small amount left of it) in Seoul are either religious or military/government buildings, not civilian ones, so this is both special and something ordinary people can more easilly relate to. It is possible to stay in a hanog bed and breakfast in Bukchon and this would be something I would definitely go for. I only had dinner in a hanog restaurant here and it was a great experience, although of course you need to be able to be comfortable sitting on the floor.",237,much

We saw a lot of the hanoks from the outside, but only got to go in one of them, which was a bed and breakfast place. There we got to rent one hanbok each, and take pictures of ourselves in traditional Korean costumes and accessories. It was so much fun!  Had we planned our Bukchon visit better, we would’ve been able to do so much more that the place offered: participate in Korean handicraft making, learn to make kimchi, among other things. But it was a good walk anyway, like a blast from the past of Korea.  There were a lot of independent cafes and small stores that were really interesting. The lunch we ate at one of the cafes in Bukchon was probably the best one we had our entire trip in Seoul.  Bukchon Traditional Hanok Village is a definite must-see when in Seoul.",239,much

There are several small museums and houses that offer traditional Korean art activities. Small interesting stores and coffee shops are also in the area.

What I personally found is that you don’t truly see much while you are there. Because you walk in and around streets and alleys you only really see roofs, walls and doors. Don’t get me wrong it was interesting but not what I expected. It is also more visually stunning than what pictures will ever be able to capture, so in my opinion take a few photos but don’t be worried about photographing a ton of structures.  You can go in a few places that are now shops, but we decided to forego that process since they were mostly tea houses and I’m not a big tea drinker. Also the touristy shops on the main street are nothing to get excited about.  The one thing we did do is find some great food in the neighborhood.

You can find one at the cultural centre or with one of the tourist helpers that stand around some intersections.",289,much
290,124,1420,We really enjoyed touring this village as it had old world charm and showcased the traditional homes and the korean style charming village. It’s a wonderful place for the foreign tourist to get a quick intro to old Korea. We had much fun people watching and enjoyed some traditional hot tea at the tea house. We highly recommend this place as a destination in Seoul.,290,much

They're people living in that village, though its name as a village, rather, more on very much developed small town as compared to my hometown.  There are a lot of steep climb along the residential area, I was just lucky because I've carry manfrotto along as had it setup steadily to avoid and beat the uneven road surface, gradient and etc.  Spotted one of the houses' walls stacked up by raw bricks inside the village, taking advantage to make use of this wall to do our couple shooting. Many tourists doing their own smartphones shooting too, they were laughing why the hassle where smartphone already sufficed for the photography. I don't blame them, indeed smartphones' quality could be very good for photography, just that maybe I am still old school fella who still doing photography in an old fashion way.",292,much

294,128,1507,If you are interested in historical architecture this is the place to go to. A large area of traditional Korean housing and buildings. Most are occupied so there are only a few that you can enter and they are either retail outlets or in one case a small museum. If you can go inside do so as it gives you a much better feel of the layout of these unique buildings. Gave us a great feel of Korea,294,much
295,129,1510,"A shop owner where we had just bought some Korean tea highly recommended we come check out this area. Not sure why, we began our hike, I mean exactly that, a hike, because of the steep grade the streets are on. It didn't take long for us to see why it was essential we come see this place. Right next to busy, loud, modern downtown Seoul, you can find this magnificent old town where things appear to not have changed much for centuries. What beautiful homes, this is truly an architectural jewel in the middle of Seoul. Ladies, don't wear high heels! Wear comfortable shoes and take a jacket. Even it it's a warm day, it can get very windy and chilly once you reach the top. This is not appropriate for parents pushing strollers! We loved all the narrow alleys, the old homes that still look today as they did hundreds of years ago. It's wonderful to see how the locals take such excellent care of this old neighborhood. Just lovely! Take lots of photos, if the crowds let you. That was the only negative part of the time we spent here. It's so crowded at times, sometimes you have to wait long periods of time to find an alley or a façade with no crowds to take a decent photo. Enjoy your time here. It really is a must see! Pay attention to details in the craftsmanship of the structures, the wood carvings, the designs, everything! Absolutely stunning!",295,much
296,130,1518,"It's still a housing estate so you shouldn't be making a lot.of noise there. The houses are quite pretty coz of their roofs. If you wanna see prettier and much more bukchon houses, go to jeonju, outside of seoul , 3 hr bus ride.  If you wanna see even older houses, travel back.in time, visit the Korean folk village at suwon. traditional Performances included. About 2.5 hrs away from seoul by metro. However, it's just a remake of a village not an actual one",296,much
297,131,1522,While the houses here are the historic ones they are actually real houses that people live in so be wary not to make too much noise. Worth a visit if you are visiting the nearby palaces (can walk by foot). Check out the information centre to hear about the free house museum that's worth going to.,297,much

The walls in the area are plastered with posters advising where you cannot take pictures and constantly telling you to stay quiet.  I understand this is due to the fact that people live and work here but then there are stalls exploiting the tourists who are playing music out loud to attract people.  A strange place which, though not exceptionally busy, still a tourist spot through and through. Not that much to do or experience.",299,much
300,134,1558,"I went there after lunch and had a pleasant walking for the whole afternoon. There is a lot to see. Better get the village map in advance, becuase the village have two parts that are separated by a main road, and one side is much larger. Don't miss any part of it !",300,much
301,135,1563,This would a must visit destination for those Korean drama lovers. To avoid crowds go in the morning as the tour groups tend to arrive by 11am. Please avoid making too much noises as these houses are still resided by residents. The top of the hill has a great view of the city. Also enjoyed traditional Woojeon tea at a traditional tea house. A street vendor also sold amazing fresh fried dumplings between Anguk station and Bukchon Hanok Village.,301,much

304,138,1578,It was awkward wandering living neighbourhood which was clean and well kept. The building design are interesting to look at. There are none to go in and I spotted to drink stops on the outskirts. Worth a look if you have time but Seoul has so much more to offer. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful,304,much
305,139,1586,"This area of traditional hanok houses - and new ones being built - is full of arty crafty workshops and tourists dressed in hanbok having their photos taken. It's a pleasure to wander round the lanes imagining a less frantic way of life, if you manage to go at a quieter time. You can get a map at the visitor centre showing where a lot of the workshops are. We visited a gold leaf workshop where a lovely man took great pleasure in explaining his work and showing examples to us with no expectation of selling anything. There are also quite a few residential buildings with notices outside telling you to be quiet - not much chance of that!",305,much
306,140,1592,"We had a fairly difficult time finding the actual village proper, because after getting off at the right subway, you need to walk a long, long way to see any tourists. We definitely had different expectations upon arriving. What we assumed was a museum-like town turned out to be an actual residential district! People actually live in this part of town, and what makes it a ""hanok"" village is that all of their homes resemble the old ""hanok"" of Korea's past dynasties.  Unless you get a walking tour with a group, you won't have any commentary at all. But if you go here yourself, you can find a hanbok rental store and wear their traditional costume around the village for 1-2 hours! I think it's a great deal and is worth the Won because the experience of wearing their costume freely around an old-school style village is priceless. It's like you're living the life of a traditional Korean princess! Besides that, there isn't much to see or do.",306,much
307,141,1604,"It took a while for me to find this place, because it isn't easy to find. We ended up following a tour group to find it. We walked from the palace to this place, probably 15 minutes walk, but we got lost several times, so it actually took 1 hr. The surrounding area between the palace and this village is very hip, so lots of shopping and eating. The village itself is small, aside from photo-op, not really much to do.",307,much

There two places you can go around. from the National museum, you can cross the road and go straight along the streets. you can wander around the but you need to careful because there are people living there. There are signage that tells you to ""shhhhhhhh"". You can take a pictures here and there and also you can see the view of Seoul from here too.

The old houses in traditional and typical Korean style were there but they were modern with luxury cars and so on. Tourists flooded it with hanbok and camera to take their selfie pictures just to show off on social networks.

There are guides and a route, that takes you up some lively streets with cute little shops and artist galleries, and also quieter neighborhood streets. We very much recommend trying to do the whole loop, as it is a great way to see the beautiful old Hanoks and neighborhoods.

Local people and tourist like to spend their time here.  One fine day, we stroll along the village, this village also residential area, so we have to keep silent.

319,153,1708,Unless you're into olden days architecture there is nothing much for you to do or see here. It is like walking around outside of people's houses and taking pictures as if we (or they) are aliens. I don't understand the hype about wandering in a housing area.,319,much

We rested and had traditional rice drink and ginseng tea in one of tea houses there. We got ourselves warmed and enjoyed the quiet feel about the village. Unfortunately we had a short disturbance by a bunch of rather loud tourists who came by looking to use the toilet. Be forewarned, this is pretty much a residential area with only a few tea houses in it. So it will be difficult to find rest rooms around here. It's good to be prepared or you will end up like the rowdy tourists group we met. In the end, they were refused and turned away as they have no intention to buy any drinks from the tea house.",323,much

So me and my friend decided to go back the next day, but at 7am instead. We were still not alone but I got so much better photos. So I recommend going here before breakfast if possible.

From the stop, cross the street and just follow the crowd. From the photospot no. 4(if I remembered correctly) which is the observation point, you can walk down to Samcheongdong using steep staircase or the not too steep/far walkway.

Just admiring the beautiful houses and the serenity it seems to bring being around there.",343,much

Some houses charges entrance fees for touring the house and asking questions. Some offer traditional crafts for a fee between 10,000-20,000 won. Is fun to try some of the crafts. They might look easy but you will be surprised it can be so tedious!  My niece dropped her iPhone and the screen cracked. So be careful with your phones when you are there because there so many big and small stones everywhere on the floor. Whichever angle at which you dropped your phone, chances are the screen will crack. 😭",350,much

It felt like we were traversing a cultural maze that had a small intersection in every turn. It was a constant mind boggling decision as to which direction to take to fully appreciate our visit.  We had no one to tell us where to go and what to do. We just made a quick stop at the tourist information office where we got a map of the village and off we went. Looking back, that was certainly not a great idea. But we were clueless as to the availability of a guide anyway, so we didn't have much of a choice.  The traditional looking houses in the village appeared to have local residents living inside. So practically, this was a peek of the actual traditional Korean village. It was quite an interesting experience, but we got too exhausted to a point that regret surfaced at the end of our walking tour.

The area is surrounded by Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace and Jongmyo Shrine,and is home to hundreds of traditional houses that date back to the Joseon Dynasty. Very colorful neighborhoods and many of these hanoks operate as coffee shops, cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses.

Our guide new all the alleyways and which paths to take to see the best sights and views. She also gave us much more info on the area and history that we would not have gotten if we had walked this area on our own.  I highly recommend booking a guide with visit Seoul!

I just cant tell if it was for a commercial or drama or movie, and I didnt knew the actors. But goodlooking, though. :)",371,much

It is a historic area but it feels very manufactured and sterile. You do not get the impression this is what Korea used to be like. Couple this manufactured feel with the huge crowds and it's just not a great place to visit. If I didn't live in Seoul, I probably would not have visited here.

On the other hand, if you are searching for some houses which may have been used as filming locations, you will have to come prepared as these information are not disclosed (rightfully so, as to not disturb the residents of those houses).

Not sure if it is that busy every day but it made it feel much less like exploring and more like everyone was just shuffling through it together. Still got some good photos and saw some interesting things though! Would probably suggest going on a weekday not in the holidays if you can to avoid the crowds!,377,much

But if you are staying in R.O.K more than 1 week, I think It will be better for you to go to the countryside just like Junjoo or Andong. There are many traditional villages there and those ones are much more better and in the countryside, there is a traditional show so you can enjoy the show.",379,much

Most have been turned into restaurants, coffee shops or shops with varying merchandise, much of it quite ethnic and interesting looking. We were cold enough that we were finally driven into a coffee roasters where we had a divine and warming mocha latte. We took any number of photos of some of the more interesting ""homes"" but as darkness set in we decided that we should head back to the station. On our way downhill, we sopped to watch a gal half seated, half lying on the ground, who was heating a pot of sugar over an open flame (probably about 5 minutes) until she could pour this carmel colored ""batter"" onto a baking sheet where she folded it in half, cut it into 3 equal pieces, flattened each piece with a spatula, and then impressed each with a different imprint.

The Bukchon Hanok Village is nestled between the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Changdeokgung Palace. It is located in the Insadong area of Seoul and an easy walk from the Angkuk subway station. The history of the village goes back 600 years, but the area has been preserved and reconstructed to the way it was. The narrow streets and the walls are all brick. Many winding hilly paths, and great views of the old Korean residential neighborhoods. There are still people living in these houses and also some people still working their businesses out of these houses. The problem is if you start on one path and continue, you my not see what is in the other direction. There really is no specific course to take so it is pretty much on your own instincts. There will be modern structures also as you go thru the area, maybe a place for a meal or drink and of course souvenirs, but not in a tacky way. It is a great picture taking attraction.",392,much

There are interesting restaurants and coffee shops (and a museam) on the way up to the village from the station and back down again.

412,9,679,"Really liked Bukchon the first time I visited but not this time. It was very touristy both times so nothing new but it was the banners around the village through which locals expressed their anger at tourists and how they are suffering through tourism which put me off. While I understand how constant flows of noisy, disrespectful visitors can be oppressive, it's really something they need to work out with the tourism authorities to find a solution rather than hang out insulting messages. Also at the end of the day, it's no big deal. It's quirky and quaint but the hanok buildings can be seen in other areas outside of Seoul. So if you are going to be going off the beaten track in S Korea it's not really worth visiting Bukchon. Its location between the 2 most popular palaces in Seoul make it an inevitable stop though. So if you do visit, be prepared for an unfriendly reception and try not to piss the residents off more by talking and laughing loudly (as we saw some inconsiderate visitors do).",412,nothing

One of the hanog I saw sported a mass of barbed wire all over the garden wall, which was not exactly a pleasure to look at. Still, it is a precious piece of heritage as all the other historic architecture (the very small amount left of it) in Seoul are either religious or military/government buildings, not civilian ones, so this is both special and something ordinary people can more easilly relate to. It is possible to stay in a hanog bed and breakfast in Bukchon and this would be something I would definitely go for.

Luckily we were spotted by two wonderful red aproned volunteer tour guides, who gave us a map and pointed the way to the ""most famous view"" in the hanok village. They weren't wrong. It's a bit of an uphill climb, but when you get tot he top of a row of beautiful hanok houses and look down the street to see modern seoul framed in the distance, it really takes your breath away.

Since the area is essentially just a neighborhood of new and old houses which keep the look and style of old Korean dwellings, to walk around is free. This attracts a lot of people as expected. What I personally found is that you don’t truly see much while you are there. Because you walk in and around streets and alleys you only really see roofs, walls and doors. Don’t get me wrong it was interesting but not what I expected. It is also more visually stunning than what pictures will ever be able to capture, so in my opinion take a few photos but don’t be worried about photographing a ton of structures.  You can go in a few places that are now shops, but we decided to forego that process since they were mostly tea houses and I’m not a big tea drinker. Also the touristy shops on the main street are nothing to get excited about.  The one thing we did do is find some great food in the neighborhood.

433,30,1708,Unless you're into olden days architecture there is nothing much for you to do or see here. It is like walking around outside of people's houses and taking pictures as if we (or they) are aliens. I don't understand the hype about wandering in a housing area.,433,nothing
434,31,1741,nothing much to see here except hiking up this small residential area  lots of tourists sometimes  there are also info guides in the area,434,nothing
435,32,1746,Mind blowing buildings. Very old and interesting layout. Free access. You need to pay money to enter old house for tea ceremony. Had higher expectations some sort of old market and stall. People still live in the houses. Perhaps thats why nothing much to do there.,435,nothing
436,33,1812,"Bukchon is just a residential area with a taste of old Korea and most of the houses were locked and closed when we visited there. Need to walk for 20-30 mins along the wall of Gyeongbukgung palace before reaching Buckhon. Do take bus or other transport to reach Bukchon. Honestly, nothing much in Buckhon and should be able to complete the area by 1 hour.",436,nothing
437,34,1831,Very subdued old neighborhood where you can still see what Seoul used to look like before modernization. Takes about an hour to walk through it. It's nothing spectacular but a convenient location to add to your list of sightseeing if you're visiting the palaces nearby.,437,nothing
438,35,1857,"The houses are now residences so tourists are advised to stay silent while walking through the village. There's nothing to see but old wooden doors and walls. We cant even see what a typical old house looked like inside. There were some quaint artshops and cafes but other than that, nothing special. They had lots of volunteer tour guides who will help you find your way.",438,nothing
439,36,1975,"While a stroll through Bukchon Village may feel like a trip through the ages, the neighborhood is not frozen in time. Some of the hanoks are still private homes, but others have been converted into tea houses, coffee shops, cafés, art galleries, inns and museums.  Although it seems like its nothing much but I think I spent like 2 hours walking around the neighborhood. Just admiring the beautiful houses and the serenity it seems to bring being around there.",439,nothing
440,37,2123,"Great for photo-taking as this is one of the last few original villages in Korea! There's a free museum to show you how it looks like inside and a few locally-run stores along the path. Other than that, nothing much else to do! Do keep your voices down as people still do live in the houses. Crowed with lots of people squeezed onto a small upslope path.",440,nothing
441,38,2181,"I've always been amazed with these hanoks whenever I see them in Korean dramas, so I made it a point to visit Bukchon last December. Wear the most comfortable shoes when you visit, as you will do nothing but walk. Be prepared for the uphill trek, too. The pathways are lovely, and the houses are a sight to behold.",441,nothing
442,39,2199,Went with high expectations and well after a walk from the nearest station of about 10 mins reached the place . . kept on wondering what was there to see apart from small lanes and old houses . . only go if you have nothing else to see :),442,nothing
443,40,2422,This place is good for sightseeing and cafe hopping. It's quiet along the routes within the residential areas but nothing spectacular. Nice to have a walk around but not a must to go.,443,nothing
444,41,2508,"Bukchon is like a living museum, right in the middle of the city and within walking distance from the main tourist attractions in Seoul, namely Gyeongbokgung, Insadong and Gwanghwamun Square. Having said that, there are people living in the well-preserved village. Unfortunately, tourists did not think about that fact when they shouted at each other like it was an area full of residential buildings and nothing else. Because of this, there are signboards seeking tourists to keep their voices down which seemed to be ignored.  It was nice to get lost in the village but it does not hurt to get a copy of the map from the tourist information counter at the beginning of the road.  There are a plenty of hanok villages in Seoul alone. This is probably the most popular one due to its location and wonderful hilly view with photo opportunity spots you may find along the way.",444,nothing
445,42,2531,"Freezing cold to walk around the village. There were some houses open for visitors to look around to get a feel of the history of the place. But other than that, I did not quite enjoy it. We were lucky we were with a private tour company that had local guides who knew how to bring us to the top of a church that had a birds eye view of the village. That was the highlight of a rather dull place. Hmmmm.... nothing else to talk about it really.....",445,nothing
446,43,2572,Traditional homes and structures. Quiet alleys. Like nothing else you've seen. We stayed there a could night. Loved it but our backs protested the sleeping on floor challenge.,446,nothing
447,44,2646,"It's a nice stroll if you come with your partner, but there's really nothing special. Might be better and able to experience more if stay in one of the hanok hostel.  There are some unique stores selling art and crafts, nice cafés, but all are pricey.",447,nothing
448,45,2694,"I thought I was going to have a photographic feast in Bukchon Hanok. The houses were nice but to me, the whole area was nothing special. Only get a few nice shots because there were so many tourists flocked the houses. If you are planning to come here, you can start your walk from Insadong area, then make a stop at Ssamsigil (they have plenty of cute knick-knacks for your family back home), then continue your walk a little bit to Bukchon Hanok. There are plenty of tourist guides along the area just in case you need some directions.",448,nothing
449,46,2721,I would suggest walking the neighborhood. The place reminds me of the old Seoul that I used to know as a child. There are a few restaurants around here but nothing special.,449,nothing
