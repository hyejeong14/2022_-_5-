26,26,282,"Great place to let children run and play. Zoo is very depressing and deteriorating. I wouldn’t take kids to see the zoo. I saw many parents throwing stuff at the animals, and by all means, don’t let your children be unattended here I was holding my baby and two adults rushed to get a picture of a monkey, pushing me aside, and standing in front of my child. I’ll never forget it. The chimp was amazing, the adults were animals.The place is safe, but so crowded and old men and women will shove children.  The land is great, a piece of nature set in the city. Beautiful nature and weekdays are less crowded. Weekends from spring to fall are rough; religious groups and summer camps occupy most of the land, but there are quiet places if you search.  I’ve seen elderly men and women knocking squirrel nests out of trees to forage for acorns. Now there are signs informing people not to steal acorns. There’s annoying music playing all over the park, so you can’t escape Kpop even in nature.  The best thing about this place is the amphitheater. Great live performances. I highly recommend. But, sometimes there are very young girls (age 8-15) dressed like prostitutes twerking to Kpop on stage and it was SO awkward. .... especially as tons of old guys filmed it.... yeah, maybe grandparents, but I saw a lot of guys wandering by to film. Was so weird.  Convenience stores are here so you’ll have places to buy water or snacks.  There’s an ancient amusement park with rides that look like they’re from 1962, so ride at your own risk. I like the amusement park, but again, stay close to your kids and as always, prepare to be racially mocked, disrespected, or abused.  Enjoy this beautiful park. Avoid the morbid zoo.",26,people
27,27,291,"The park was pretty good, but even better was the FREE Zoo.  Lots of animals to see, had some gardens to visit, and has a large children's museum to visit.  There are also some walkways over ponds and sculptures to see as you walk around.  There was also food stops encase you needed something in a rush but I saw many people bringing in lunches.",27,people
28,28,306,It was raining so there were not many people in the park. Early April was the cherry blossom time and the visit was quite worthwhile despite the difficulty of taking photos (with the lens getting wet every few seconds). The amusement park was not in operation in the rain for safety.,28,people
29,29,325,"This is one of Seoul's best values for the family or anyone really. It's an old huge park that has many things to do for all types of people whether young or old. One of the highlights is the amusement park which is not huge but good for children up to high school kids. The rides aren't huge but big enough for kids to enjoy and you can purchase single ride tickets too.  There's a smallish zoo that kids would love. Also, there are a couple of playgrounds for kids to romp around in. If the weather is good, I would recommend taking a day or half a day and walking around.",29,people
30,30,326,"This large park in amongst the buildings is supposedly all about the kids. There is an amusement park with rides, a small zoo and theatre within the park. The zoo is horrendous. ...awful enclosures, the animals are lacking stimulation. I was mortified to see a vending machine selling food for the animals- people were encouraged to feed the animals. I saw some young adults throwing food at, not to, thr chimp and baboons. Awful behavior. The chimp enclosure is disgusting. ..the guinea pigs had a better home. Also the big cats and elephant have very small enclosures too. It broke my heart. Many exhibits were closed to prevent the spread of bird flu (so the signs said). Lots of old people meeting up for dating and walking group within the park. The botanical gardens within the park were awful too....totally indoors! Not really a garden, more like a green house. I was disappointed by my visit.",30,people
31,31,335,"We stayed nearby the park. I walked to Children's park almost every morning until I checked out to hotel. I couldn't believe my eyes that this park is really huge and grand! To me, it was amazing! I love this park on top of all parks. The feeling was good while walking (really long up and down walk) that you could actually explore many places in it.  There was a cafe that you could get a good souvenir and helped the children from the other side of the world. There was a massive grand orchestral open air hall that I sat there and listened to classical music (scheduled and not open as yet especially in Winter depending on the time schedule).  The breeze was so cool and warm sunshine. The other side has tin man park with all unusual shapes and sizes in forming different art piece for adults and kids. Wings chair, playground and hopping scale towards the dustbins (if you still have kids heart, you know what I'm talking about~ lol). You too can play as it said adults are allow to play. Please read the sign before playing and keep it tidy.  There is a mini zoo but closed during Winter (I was disappointed for not able to visit) and botanica garden. You might want to bring your kids or friends could visit during other season of time. On the other side, there was a huge theater and performance place that only opens at 10am (Korea Time) but I usually take my early walk and I skip this.  Lots of people walking and exercising in this park. You can go to a special training animal place and find out more when they open at 10am. A water park centre is also there too. By, now you will be thinking, are you serious? YES! I wish I could have more time for it! There are pagoda, some resting place, a bridge, many many sculptures and historical monuments, also a garden of nice flowers (Winter no longer can be seen).  Don't miss the Cafe as you can see coffee seed plant at other season. Music pieces too. I love arts, science and music with coffee and you would definitely see my reviews will be based on this.  It was a good experience staying in the neighborhood with nice landlady, good shoe seller (aunty who is dedicated) and lots of food surrounded. Easy to get your amenities at the convenience shops too!  Check this park out and I truly hope you will love it! Entrance is free!",31,people
32,32,358,"I'm not a vegan or some sort of animal hero, but this place made me want to dive off a cliff. I can't imagine how people rated this beyond Average. Maybe I could say it is average. They actually play terrible Kpop music through speakers as you're trying to walk through nature. They hate foreigners (personal experiences at least three times- take my word for it or kill yourself because I don't care) -- watched families scream and throw bubble gum at animals, watched Ahjumas stealing acorns when there were actual signs posted saying for humans not to steal the squirrel food (and then when I went to the bathroom there were acorns scattered around from being washed in the bathroom) --- oh yeah, the animals -- depressing display. Made me actually want to grab a sign and protest. Christ, maybe I'm becoming sensitive. Nope. this place was hell. AND, I'm a hunter, fisher, outdoorsman .... so, not your average HO complaining. Go here,,, just go here on a weekend and please don't kill yourself.",32,people
33,33,367,"Best things about this park are that it's close to the city centre and so very easy to get to by the metro, and it's FREE!!!  We took line 5 on the metro which takes you to the back gate of the park, but it's still an impressive entrance gate. There were fountains by the entrance, and then more in the middle of the park which are what my daughter loved most (and she got drenched, so a change of clothing may have been a good idea). There are also several play areas, most of which are sandy, so appropriate beach-type footwear would have been better than the shoes she went in, but we'll know for next time  She didn't really like the zoo area much, and the animal enclosures did look quite small which I often think is quite sad for the animals, so I was quite glad she didn't want to spend too long in that part.  We went on a Friday afternoon and the park was quite busy with groups of school children. There were also quite a number of people who had taken picnics, and pop-up tents to shield themselves from the very bright sun (we weren't very well prepared as I thought it was going to be a cloudy day and hadn't expected it to be so hot).  We only went into 1 toilet block and ended up using the disabled toilet which had the type of toilet in that we're more used to - the toilets in the ladies were ""squat"" style, which I don't like and I knew would it would be disastrous to try to get my 5-year old to use one of them!!!!",33,people
34,34,380,"Being from Melbourne that has some great urban spaces, I really love Korean parks, but this one didn't grab me. In its winter coat it looked drab and over run. The parrot enclosure was closed due to concerns about avian influenza, my kangaroo compatriot did not look good, I saw a zebra standing in sub zero temperatures and I did not dare see the Animal show. I had more fun watching people feed the animals with the packets of pellets available from the vending machine. Don't get me wrong, it's a free park, there is an amusement centre, and given the right day with kids you could have a great time, sadly it was not for me.",34,people
35,35,385,"This park has some of animals and korean people mostly occupied rather than foreigners. Type of people were families and couples. Above all, the entry fee is FOC so it is good to look walk around when i am idle on weekends!",35,people
36,36,402,"It was very hot outside but our children wanted to have fun anyway. Plus! It was summer vocation time in Korea. So every attraction sight was crowded with millions of people. So this park was good, not too many people, they went into special fountain which was very fun and cool x. They had a nice zoo but the park is going to be much more exiting in 2014, when the restoration will be over.",36,people
37,37,408,"It's a great place for people to go to relax but i would NOT!!! ever go their again because if you want to encorage animal crulty then by all means go i won't stop you but it breaks your heart to see great beautiful animals locked up in cages with not nearly enough room to run in. you'l see it in the wolves, the lions ect but what bugged me the most was that sad miserable look in the coyotes eyes and that makes you never want to go to a zoo again. so i didn't like it but other people might but don't go and do it for the animals.",37,people
38,38,411,"We stumbled across this place and was quite surprised! Its a great free, theme park/Zoo for both young and old. The monkeys were great, I did wonder about some of the enclosures being very small and other people have questioned it so I hope they do look after them well. Some parts of it were a bit runned down but its definately a great place to visit or walk through! They do put the animals away later in the day as we found out so keep in mind the closing times.  A Must visit if you are in the area. If you are in guesthouses nearby its a great day out without travelling too far!",38,people
39,39,418,"We visited this park in Seoul because it was free and we wanted to see the music fountain! To see the lit up fountain with sound effects was cool but there was so much more..people go there to do some dance as a group done by community workers i guess , my daughter joined in and had a great time. The zoo was a bit old but still enjoyable..there is some rides for kids as well!",39,people

50,10,285,"We went with our 20month old toddler and really enjoyed the whole day there. It's a huge park with outdoor and indoor playground. Probably because we went on a weekday, the whole park was very quiet. Entrance to the main park is free, but certain attractions charge a fee. Key highlights 1) best thing about this place is the Seoul Children's Museum. There's an entrance fee but it's not expensive. They also allow u to exit and re-enter on the same day. There are 4 storeys catering to different children age groups and the set up on each floor is very impressive, especially the water play on level 3! I think it's fun for all kids from toddlers to teens. 2) catch the animal show called Anistory featuring many types of animals including seals, birds, cats, monkey etc. Need to pay for entry though. It's quite entertaining. Even though we didn't understand the language, we still enjoyed it very much. 3) the park is massive, great if u like outdoor walks. There's a huge water fountain show near the Seoul Children's Museum that's quite impressive too.  Overall a nice destination that offers both indoor and outdoor experiences. I didn't like the mini zoo though. Each enclosure was very small and the animals looked a bit depressed. I wouldn't recommend if your only objective is to visit the zoo.",50,much
51,11,286,"This place is a hidden gem and not many tourists visit this park. Very nice, clean and spacious park with lots to see like gardens, playground & mini-zoo. Kids would definitely love this place. The mini-zoo is a little sad as it's under-maintained and some animals look sad in their enclosures.  Plus point: Nice, clean and spacious park. Free entry except for the amusement park section. Not crowded!  Negative: Somewhat under-maintained. Has the potential to be much better",51,much
52,12,288,"Information found online about the Children’s Grand Park can sometimes be sketchy and inconsistent.  I hope that the following will provide a better picture for those planning to visit the park. I have also attached a picture of the park map that I will refer to below.  The park can be accessible by 2 subway stations.  The main gate (#1 on map) is accessible easily by the Children's Grand Park Station on Line 7.  There is a rear gate (#36 on map) that is accessible by the Achasan Station on Line 5.  The park has no entrance fee, except for the amusement park section.  My suggestion is that children below 14 yrs will appreciate the park.  I brought a tween son, and 2 pre-school kids to the park.  All three enjoyed the amusement park (#38 on map), which is closer to the rear gate. The amusement park had rides catering to pre-school kids to tweens. Do note there are some rides that have a 120cm height requirement. Rides such as the Viking, Dropzone and Roller coaster are generally adapted for tweens. For those a little younger, there are bumper cars and spinning saucers that are children friendly. However, this place would not be recommended for toddlers. A cafeteria is found within the amusement park serving traditional Korean foods and burgers. Nothing to shout about but it satisfies the tummy.  Amusement park entrance fees depends on the type of ticket you purchase. Tickets are available in single ride, 5 rides, 10 rides and unlimited rides options.  For the 5 ride option, kids paid 16,000 won. Adults paid 19,000 for the same ticket.  Toddlers and pre-school kids should check out the playground (#12 on map) with wet play and dry obstacle options. Bring your toys for sand play if you wish.  The other attraction we tried was the zoo – a mini zoo at that. We saw an elephant, snakes, birds and baboons. A couple of macaws looked like they were suffering from a disease that caused balding on their body. The kids enjoyed the zoo but soon lost interest in it once they stepped out of the zoo.  Next to the zoo is a pavilion which sells snacks (#34 on map) like ice-cream, corn dogs and cold drinks – a great respite from the heat.  2 attractions that we did not visit – the children’s museum (#46 on map) and Kid’s Auto Park (#44 on map) would probably suit school going kids.  Directions:  For the museum, and auto park, use the main gate.  For the amusement park, use the rear gate.  The zoo is in the middle of the park and are equidistant from either gates.  In summary, this park is accessible by 2 subway lines. It provides a place for kids to be themselves and preserves the sanity of parents who want kids to run wild and not bother them for too much over a couple of hours. School going children will probably benefit the most out of a half day excursion to this park.",52,much
53,13,307,"This is the BEST, MOST AWESOME, CLEANEST, WELL-MAINTAIINED, museum for kids. My toddler 23months wnjoyed the toddlers area - crawling, climbing, sliding, and pretend house play. My 12 and 7 years old enjoyed the water play area, construction area, the wheel chair experience, digital art, and so much more. We stayed 10am to 4pm, and they still can't get enough. It was really a fun fun day.",53,much
54,14,316,"The children's museum was such an amazing place for kids. One could easily spend the whole day at the museum and the park. Be prepared to spend more than 3 hours here if you bring your kids to the museum because there's just so much activities for them to do. Ticket were very reasonably priced, which is a huge bonus point!",54,much
55,15,329,"The place is big... if you have young children, walking from one end to another is a challenge.  2-3 playgrounds. One decent sized amusement park with a range of rides.  The children's museum is not expensive but is packed with 4 floors of displays and activities. It is similar to the children's museum in Ottawa. There is enough English signage on the displays.  We went in march so weather was still chilly and the foliage was bare. It would be so much better in spring/summer months!!",55,much
56,16,331,"My 4 year old boy loved it, did not want to leave, and says he wants to fly 8 hours to go back there. Tomorrow.  So the rating I gave here refers purely to the Museum, and not to the park.  This Museum is a very interactive museum designed for young children, probably best for those between 4-7. Spread over 4 floors, to the kids, it will be 99% play and 1% learning. There are explanations in English as well as Korean, but I doubt if the kids are going to read these. Straight to the fun.  We had originally allocated one day to cover both the Children's Grand Park and the Seoul Children's Museum, which share a compound. During winter, half a day in the Park (free admission; pay for specific rides) is sufficient. But as mentioned earlier, half a day for the Museum -- at least to my kid -- was not enough.  To note, there is a small café on the ground floor near the entrance. But to really have a meal, the little mall across the road is probably more suitable.  There is an admission charge to enter this Museum.  For parents and older kids, there isn't much (else) to do.  One last point: this Museum can be accessed from the ""Children's Grand Park"" subway station.",56,much
57,17,339,"The entire park is a good place for kids to roam. There are at least two playgrounds where kids can use the facilities. We paid 500won for free play of traditional Korean games and also arcade games at the stage area (just near the entrance).  For the museum, it will be worthwhile to go in earlier so that your kids can have more time to explore all the stations. The driving centre was closed when we went there at about 3 pm on a Saturday.  There is a lack of restaurants around so it will be good to pre pack some food in case your kids are hungry. The only food place we can get is the small cafeteria at the museum.  Most of the zoo enclosures were closed or empty (probably due to winter and the bird flu season) so do not expect to see much from the zoo.",57,much
58,18,343,My child is six and wanted to spend most of his time at the amusement rides. However he was deemed too short to ride most even with an adult - and even the dodgems which was a surprise. So the rides were limited. We also tried to go to a part of the park where kids can drive little cars but it was all shut up and didn't look to be used much. We didn't get to the zoo part.,58,much
59,19,348,"We are foreigners living in Seoul and loved this gem. It's very easy to get to from line 4 on the subway. We came here to go to the zoo but we found much more here. There is a great place for small kids to play indoors but that can be pricey. I would avoid coming here on Jr sunny days though, the walking can be brutal.",59,much
60,20,363,Went there with a friend and had so much fun! It reminded me of my childhood and made me feel like a child again. This park is so big that even though i spend there whole day i still could see much more on my next visit.,60,much

Very interactive and worry not, everything come with english translation.  Thing to note: bring your own lunch/food. The cafe sells ice cream n coffee only.

65,25,393,"Doing too much touristy things for the adults in Seoul? Give your kids at least half a day here in the big outdoor playground, sand/dirt area, free zoo including camel and donkey rides, musical water fountain, etc..

We ate at the botanical garden cafeteria. My son and I had pasta carbonara for 6000 won each and it was delicious. My husband had a burger which was actually two smaller patties side by side, I believe his was about 7000 won for the burger, fries and drink, he said it was good, but he was not as ecstatic over his meal as I was about mine. I was just happy that they had pasta which is one of the few things my 3 year old will eat. There were many family mart vendors around so finding a drink when you needed one was easy. The restrooms were very clean and always nearby. We went to the amusement park and opted for single ride tickets, 3000 won for each ride for our son, and 4000 won for each ride for us, we only rode a few rides. My husband and I took turns on the roller coaster which was really fun. And our son rode the kiddie truck ride and the carousel. You can also buy a combo ticket for 5 rides, I believe it was 12000 won for children and 15000 for adults. Or you could buy a ride all day bracelet which I believe was 20000 and 25000 for children and adults, but those prices may not be exact. Our most favorite part of the park was the polar bears in the marine exhibit, they swim right up to the glass and being that close to such a huge animal is amazing. Also, we really enjoyed the camel ride. I rode with our 3 year old son and it was 8000 for the two of us. Our son rode a donkey by himself for 3000 won, and a gentleman led the donkey around and held onto our son to be sure he stayed on. We also went to the animal show called Anistory. It is a cross between an animal show and the cinderella story. It was 8000 for each my husband and I, and our son was free. So it cost us 16000 won to see, and although it was entertaining I didn't feel that the show was worth that much. If you go to the Seoul Zoo you should see the dolphin show, very entertaining and only 2000 won per person. We only saw one souvenir shop but didn't find anything we wanted to buy. But altogether the experience was a fun one, and I would recommend it to anyone, even those without children :)",69,much

73,3,303,"First, do not visit on a Monday as the children museum will be closed. Easily reached via metro station, very big place that has playground, a mini zoo, amusement park. We visited the amusement park and believed due to weekday only 5 rides are opened and both my kids are shorter than 120cm, left omly 3 rides to play. You can purchase the rides in 1 ride, 5 rides or day pass. No sharing between kids. Rides that need parents accompanied need extra ticket at adult rate. But the staffs were extremely nice, especially the seniors staffs, they open up rides for my kids and even allow us to join them for free, I'm very very grateful and appreciate for such kind gesture. They have really make my day especially it was raining whole day in Seoul whereby my kids don't have the chance to play the sandy playground. We also catch an animal show despite we don't understand korean, it was very entertaining seeing the animals performing. In the park, you CN also see many elderly exercising, playing with their friends. The park is big and we did not manage to finish as it was raining on and off.

75,5,326,"This large park in amongst the buildings is supposedly all about the kids. There is an amusement park with rides, a small zoo and theatre within the park. The zoo is horrendous. ...awful enclosures, the animals are lacking stimulation. I was mortified to see a vending machine selling food for the animals- people were encouraged to feed the animals. I saw some young adults throwing food at, not to, thr chimp and baboons. Awful behavior. The chimp enclosure is disgusting. ..the guinea pigs had a better home. Also the big cats and elephant have very small enclosures too. It broke my heart. Many exhibits were closed to prevent the spread of bird flu (so the signs said). Lots of old people meeting up for dating and walking group within the park. The botanical gardens within the park were awful too....totally indoors! Not really a garden, more like a green house. I was disappointed by my visit.",75,closed

The area was well-taken care of. I felt like I was in a TV show hahaha. Awesome for kids as well. I saw lots of kids having fun by themselves there. Easy access to the subway. Close to Sejong University, where I was staying. Admission was free! I spent a good 2 hours just sightseeing. Great for solo wanderers who wants peace from bricks and skyscrapers. Also safe for female travelers. They even have background music along their alleys. Oddly creative, I must say.",76,closed
77,7,335,"We stayed nearby the park. I walked to Children's park almost every morning until I checked out to hotel. I couldn't believe my eyes that this park is really huge and grand! To me, it was amazing! I love this park on top of all parks. The feeling was good while walking (really long up and down walk) that you could actually explore many places in it.  There was a cafe that you could get a good souvenir and helped the children from the other side of the world. There was a massive grand orchestral open air hall that I sat there and listened to classical music (scheduled and not open as yet especially in Winter depending on the time schedule).  The breeze was so cool and warm sunshine. The other side has tin man park with all unusual shapes and sizes in forming different art piece for adults and kids. Wings chair, playground and hopping scale towards the dustbins (if you still have kids heart, you know what I'm talking about~ lol). You too can play as it said adults are allow to play. Please read the sign before playing and keep it tidy.  There is a mini zoo but closed during Winter (I was disappointed for not able to visit) and botanica garden. You might want to bring your kids or friends could visit during other season of time. On the other side, there was a huge theater and performance place that only opens at 10am (Korea Time) but I usually take my early walk and I skip this.  Lots of people walking and exercising in this park. You can go to a special training animal place and find out more when they open at 10am. A water park centre is also there too. By, now you will be thinking, are you serious? YES! I wish I could have more time for it! There are pagoda, some resting place, a bridge, many many sculptures and historical monuments, also a garden of nice flowers (Winter no longer can be seen).  Don't miss the Cafe as you can see coffee seed plant at other season. Music pieces too. I love arts, science and music with coffee and you would definitely see my reviews will be based on this.  It was a good experience staying in the neighborhood with nice landlady, good shoe seller (aunty who is dedicated) and lots of food surrounded. Easy to get your amenities at the convenience shops too!  Check this park out and I truly hope you will love it! Entrance is free!",77,closed

We paid 500won for free play of traditional Korean games and also arcade games at the stage area (just near the entrance).  For the museum, it will be worthwhile to go in earlier so that your kids can have more time to explore all the stations. The driving centre was closed when we went there at about 3 pm on a Saturday.  There is a lack of restaurants around so it will be good to pre pack some food in case your kids are hungry. The only food place we can get is the small cafeteria at the museum.  Most of the zoo enclosures were closed or empty (probably due to winter and the bird flu season) so do not expect to see much from the zoo.",78,closed

I had more fun watching people feed the animals with the packets of pellets available from the vending machine.

We managed to still spend the entire day strolling thru the park. Very pleasant day for a stroll.  CAUTION: if you are an animal lover such as I am, then you will want to AVOID THE ANIMAL AREA!!!!! The cages as well below par, tiny, dirty and the animals have lost their will to live. They all look depressed an unhealthy.

94,7,288,"Information found online about the Children’s Grand Park can sometimes be sketchy and inconsistent.  I hope that the following will provide a better picture for those planning to visit the park. I have also attached a picture of the park map that I will refer to below.  The park can be accessible by 2 subway stations.  The main gate (#1 on map) is accessible easily by the Children's Grand Park Station on Line 7.  There is a rear gate (#36 on map) that is accessible by the Achasan Station on Line 5.  The park has no entrance fee, except for the amusement park section.  My suggestion is that children below 14 yrs will appreciate the park.  I brought a tween son, and 2 pre-school kids to the park.  All three enjoyed the amusement park (#38 on map), which is closer to the rear gate. The amusement park had rides catering to pre-school kids to tweens. Do note there are some rides that have a 120cm height requirement. Rides such as the Viking, Dropzone and Roller coaster are generally adapted for tweens. For those a little younger, there are bumper cars and spinning saucers that are children friendly. However, this place would not be recommended for toddlers. A cafeteria is found within the amusement park serving traditional Korean foods and burgers. Nothing to shout about but it satisfies the tummy.  Amusement park entrance fees depends on the type of ticket you purchase. Tickets are available in single ride, 5 rides, 10 rides and unlimited rides options.  For the 5 ride option, kids paid 16,000 won. Adults paid 19,000 for the same ticket.  Toddlers and pre-school kids should check out the playground (#12 on map) with wet play and dry obstacle options. Bring your toys for sand play if you wish.  The other attraction we tried was the zoo – a mini zoo at that. We saw an elephant, snakes, birds and baboons. A couple of macaws looked like they were suffering from a disease that caused balding on their body. The kids enjoyed the zoo but soon lost interest in it once they stepped out of the zoo.  Next to the zoo is a pavilion which sells snacks (#34 on map) like ice-cream, corn dogs and cold drinks – a great respite from the heat.  2 attractions that we did not visit – the children’s museum (#46 on map) and Kid’s Auto Park (#44 on map) would probably suit school going kids.  Directions:  For the museum, and auto park, use the main gate.  For the amusement park, use the rear gate.  The zoo is in the middle of the park and are equidistant from either gates.  In summary, this park is accessible by 2 subway lines. It provides a place for kids to be themselves and preserves the sanity of parents who want kids to run wild and not bother them for too much over a couple of hours. School going children will probably benefit the most out of a half day excursion to this park.",94,little

There were 3 levels in the museum and the kids had a lot of fun playing. The staff stamped out hands on the way in so that we could re-enter if we wanted to visit the cafe or restrooms. Overall the place is very clean and accessible, and I would recommend this to families with young children.",97,little
98,11,317,"The park itself was fine but we were so disturbed by the living conditions of the animals at the zoo that we did not enjoy the overall visit. The living spaces were incredibly small. Three zebras were kept in an area smaller than most backyards. It was very hot that day and we were saddened to see that few animals had areas to cool off in even a small pool of water. Most of the animals were pacing back and forth in their tiny living spaces, no doubt due to boredom. one of the fox seemed to have an eye infection. The elephant looked so sad and lonely. Some had little shade and no grass. This zoo would should reduce the number of animals and improve the condition of the animals by increasing living space and focusing on improved care.",98,little
99,12,331,"My 4 year old boy loved it, did not want to leave, and says he wants to fly 8 hours to go back there. Tomorrow.  So the rating I gave here refers purely to the Museum, and not to the park.  This Museum is a very interactive museum designed for young children, probably best for those between 4-7. Spread over 4 floors, to the kids, it will be 99% play and 1% learning. There are explanations in English as well as Korean, but I doubt if the kids are going to read these. Straight to the fun.  We had originally allocated one day to cover both the Children's Grand Park and the Seoul Children's Museum, which share a compound. During winter, half a day in the Park (free admission; pay for specific rides) is sufficient. But as mentioned earlier, half a day for the Museum -- at least to my kid -- was not enough.  To note, there is a small café on the ground floor near the entrance. But to really have a meal, the little mall across the road is probably more suitable.  There is an admission charge to enter this Museum.  For parents and older kids, there isn't much (else) to do.

The park offers up-close interaction with horses and a few other animals. The wild animal enclosures were well maintained and my kids had a great time viewing their occupants.

101,14,341,"I currently live as an expat right beside the Children's Grand Park. I walk through it everyday. This park is huge (3 km around) as it used to be an 18 hole golf course. One reason to visit the park is just to sit, relax, enjoy the sites (zoo, gardens, amusement park, exercise stations are good to see too), but also, it's a great place to see how regular Seoul families enjoy their day off. The kids are adorable, the parents are attentive and the older crowd seem busy staying in shape. If you can catch a lawn bowling tournament or a badminton game, you're in for a full sight. In July and August you may want to bring bathers or a set of dry clothes for little kids as there's a great stream/water pond to play in near the centre of the park. And don't miss the flowers. The park gardeners have done an excellent job ensuring there's always something in bloom. Spring is especially pretty in cherry blossom season.

129,17,282,"Great place to let children run and play. Zoo is very depressing and deteriorating. I wouldn’t take kids to see the zoo. I saw many parents throwing stuff at the animals, and by all means, don’t let your children be unattended here I was holding my baby and two adults rushed to get a picture of a monkey, pushing me aside, and standing in front of my child. I’ll never forget it. The chimp was amazing, the adults were animals.The place is safe, but so crowded and old men and women will shove children.  The land is great, a piece of nature set in the city. Beautiful nature and weekdays are less crowded. Weekends from spring to fall are rough; religious groups and summer camps occupy most of the land, but there are quiet places if you search.  I’ve seen elderly men and women knocking squirrel nests out of trees to forage for acorns. Now there are signs informing people not to steal acorns. There’s annoying music playing all over the park, so you can’t escape Kpop even in nature.  The best thing about this place is the amphitheater. Great live performances. I highly recommend. But, sometimes there are very young girls (age 8-15) dressed like prostitutes twerking to Kpop on stage and it was SO awkward. .... especially as tons of old guys filmed it.... yeah, maybe grandparents, but I saw a lot of guys wandering by to film. Was so weird.  Convenience stores are here so you’ll have places to buy water or snacks.  There’s an ancient amusement park with rides that look like they’re from 1962, so ride at your own risk. I like the amusement park, but again, stay close to your kids and as always, prepare to be racially mocked, disrespected, or abused.  Enjoy this beautiful park. Avoid the morbid zoo.",129,old
130,18,284,"My 17 month old daughter was so extremely excited to see all the animals and did not want to leave. Korea has so many family-friendly places and this is definitely one of them. I think I may have seen some strollers to rent on our way in, not entirely sure. Overall, this was a lovely experience for both of us and we look forward to going back with my husband.",130,old
131,19,285,"We went with our 20month old toddler and really enjoyed the whole day there. It's a huge park with outdoor and indoor playground. Probably because we went on a weekday, the whole park was very quiet. Entrance to the main park is free, but certain attractions charge a fee. Key highlights 1) best thing about this place is the Seoul Children's Museum. There's an entrance fee but it's not expensive. They also allow u to exit and re-enter on the same day. There are 4 storeys catering to different children age groups and the set up on each floor is very impressive, especially the water play on level 3! I think it's fun for all kids from toddlers to teens. 2) catch the animal show called Anistory featuring many types of animals including seals, birds, cats, monkey etc. Need to pay for entry though. It's quite entertaining. Even though we didn't understand the language, we still enjoyed it very much. 3) the park is massive, great if u like outdoor walks. There's a huge water fountain show near the Seoul Children's Museum that's quite impressive too.  Overall a nice destination that offers both indoor and outdoor experiences. I didn't like the mini zoo though. Each enclosure was very small and the animals looked a bit depressed. I wouldn't recommend if your only objective is to visit the zoo.",131,old
132,20,288,"Information found online about the Children’s Grand Park can sometimes be sketchy and inconsistent.  I hope that the following will provide a better picture for those planning to visit the park. I have also attached a picture of the park map that I will refer to below.  The park can be accessible by 2 subway stations.  The main gate (#1 on map) is accessible easily by the Children's Grand Park Station on Line 7.  There is a rear gate (#36 on map) that is accessible by the Achasan Station on Line 5.  The park has no entrance fee, except for the amusement park section.  My suggestion is that children below 14 yrs will appreciate the park.  I brought a tween son, and 2 pre-school kids to the park.  All three enjoyed the amusement park (#38 on map), which is closer to the rear gate. The amusement park had rides catering to pre-school kids to tweens. Do note there are some rides that have a 120cm height requirement. Rides such as the Viking, Dropzone and Roller coaster are generally adapted for tweens. For those a little younger, there are bumper cars and spinning saucers that are children friendly. However, this place would not be recommended for toddlers. A cafeteria is found within the amusement park serving traditional Korean foods and burgers. Nothing to shout about but it satisfies the tummy.  Amusement park entrance fees depends on the type of ticket you purchase. Tickets are available in single ride, 5 rides, 10 rides and unlimited rides options.  For the 5 ride option, kids paid 16,000 won. Adults paid 19,000 for the same ticket.  Toddlers and pre-school kids should check out the playground (#12 on map) with wet play and dry obstacle options. Bring your toys for sand play if you wish.  The other attraction we tried was the zoo – a mini zoo at that. We saw an elephant, snakes, birds and baboons. A couple of macaws looked like they were suffering from a disease that caused balding on their body. The kids enjoyed the zoo but soon lost interest in it once they stepped out of the zoo.  Next to the zoo is a pavilion which sells snacks (#34 on map) like ice-cream, corn dogs and cold drinks – a great respite from the heat.  2 attractions that we did not visit – the children’s museum (#46 on map) and Kid’s Auto Park (#44 on map) would probably suit school going kids.  Directions:  For the museum, and auto park, use the main gate.  For the amusement park, use the rear gate.  The zoo is in the middle of the park and are equidistant from either gates.  In summary, this park is accessible by 2 subway lines. It provides a place for kids to be themselves and preserves the sanity of parents who want kids to run wild and not bother them for too much over a couple of hours. School going children will probably benefit the most out of a half day excursion to this park.",132,old
133,21,293,"Visited with my 14 month old while on holiday in Seoul. The Children’s Museum is fantastic and has a really nice toddler play area, the park is lovely and we had a pic nice in the grass and enjoyed the botanical garden and walking around. However it was really sad to see animals like a lion, elephant, leopard and tiger looking sad in small enclosures. Young children are equally happy seeing farm animals so I would have been perfectly happy just with the goats and ponys.",133,old

135,23,301,"It's a huge park with probably everything in it - a park, a zoo, a playground, an amusement park, etc. You can easily spend half a day there on a day with nice weather. There are also strollers for rent with very reasonable price so there's no need to carry your own stroller in the subway all the way there. The zoo and amusement park may be small but perfect for our five-year-old. The foodcourt is not so bad. But it would also be nice to bring lunch and have a picnic in the park.",135,old
136,24,305,"We brought the kids to Seoul Children's Museum and went around the Seoul Childrens Grand Park. The place was huge and there was a big zoo, botanical garden, amusement park and skate park. After a few hours of visiting the above places, we eventually made our way to the Children's museum. The museum is more suited for younger kids below 10, as our 11-year old found it a little boring. There were 3 levels in the museum and the kids had a lot of fun playing. The staff stamped out hands on the way in so that we could re-enter if we wanted to visit the cafe or restrooms. Overall the place is very clean and accessible, and I would recommend this to families with young children.",136,old
137,25,307,"This is the BEST, MOST AWESOME, CLEANEST, WELL-MAINTAIINED, museum for kids. My toddler 23months wnjoyed the toddlers area - crawling, climbing, sliding, and pretend house play. My 12 and 7 years old enjoyed the water play area, construction area, the wheel chair experience, digital art, and so much more. We stayed 10am to 4pm, and they still can't get enough. It was really a fun fun day.",137,old
138,26,310,"There are so many things to do at Grand park. We went in winter, so spent most of our time in the children's museum. Amazing place to spend a few hours with a 3yr old and one year old. I think it would be good for anyone up to 6-7 years. Also, super-duper able. Maybe $10 for the whole family.  Lots of other great stuff in Grand park but most if the rest would be good in warm weather",138,old
139,27,325,"This is one of Seoul's best values for the family or anyone really. It's an old huge park that has many things to do for all types of people whether young or old. One of the highlights is the amusement park which is not huge but good for children up to high school kids. The rides aren't huge but big enough for kids to enjoy and you can purchase single ride tickets too.  There's a smallish zoo that kids would love. Also, there are a couple of playgrounds for kids to romp around in. If the weather is good, I would recommend taking a day or half a day and walking around.",139,old
140,28,326,"This large park in amongst the buildings is supposedly all about the kids. There is an amusement park with rides, a small zoo and theatre within the park. The zoo is horrendous. ...awful enclosures, the animals are lacking stimulation. I was mortified to see a vending machine selling food for the animals- people were encouraged to feed the animals. I saw some young adults throwing food at, not to, thr chimp and baboons. Awful behavior. The chimp enclosure is disgusting. ..the guinea pigs had a better home. Also the big cats and elephant have very small enclosures too. It broke my heart. Many exhibits were closed to prevent the spread of bird flu (so the signs said). Lots of old people meeting up for dating and walking group within the park. The botanical gardens within the park were awful too....totally indoors! Not really a garden, more like a green house. I was disappointed by my visit.",140,old
141,29,331,"My 4 year old boy loved it, did not want to leave, and says he wants to fly 8 hours to go back there. Tomorrow.  So the rating I gave here refers purely to the Museum, and not to the park.  This Museum is a very interactive museum designed for young children, probably best for those between 4-7. Spread over 4 floors, to the kids, it will be 99% play and 1% learning. There are explanations in English as well as Korean, but I doubt if the kids are going to read these. Straight to the fun.  We had originally allocated one day to cover both the Children's Grand Park and the Seoul Children's Museum, which share a compound. During winter, half a day in the Park (free admission; pay for specific rides) is sufficient. But as mentioned earlier, half a day for the Museum -- at least to my kid -- was not enough.  To note, there is a small café on the ground floor near the entrance. But to really have a meal, the little mall across the road is probably more suitable.  There is an admission charge to enter this Museum.  For parents and older kids, there isn't much (else) to do.  One last point: this Museum can be accessed from the ""Children's Grand Park"" subway station.",141,old
142,30,333,"Very well done. This museum merits its own TripAdvisor listing as to not confuse it with the other children's museum in Seoul. Four floors of activities and all signs in English as well as Korean. My 6 year old and nearly 4 year old loved it. A bargain at USD12 (equivalent) for the three of us. About 10-15 minute walk from Line 5, Gunja station. Easy to find and most enjoyable. Three hours flew by - and my kids didn't want to leave. Very nice section in the basement level focused on building empathy - I was impressed with the inclusion of small wheelchairs and walking stick (for the blind) to be used along a small course.",142,old
143,31,341,"I currently live as an expat right beside the Children's Grand Park. I walk through it everyday. This park is huge (3 km around) as it used to be an 18 hole golf course. One reason to visit the park is just to sit, relax, enjoy the sites (zoo, gardens, amusement park, exercise stations are good to see too), but also, it's a great place to see how regular Seoul families enjoy their day off. The kids are adorable, the parents are attentive and the older crowd seem busy staying in shape. If you can catch a lawn bowling tournament or a badminton game, you're in for a full sight. In July and August you may want to bring bathers or a set of dry clothes for little kids as there's a great stream/water pond to play in near the centre of the park. And don't miss the flowers. The park gardeners have done an excellent job ensuring there's always something in bloom. Spring is especially pretty in cherry blossom season. Use Subway Line 7 for easy access (parking is a pain on the weekends).",143,old
144,32,344,"We came as a family of 3 with our 3 year old daughter. We came here for the day. My review is very similar to others - there are several playgrounds, a water playground, lots of gorgeous paths to walk, an amusement park aimed at older children and adults, as well as numerous places to grab a snack or drink. It was easy to find as well. We took Line 7 to Children's Grand Park stop, then exit 1. Park is free of admission, unless your child wants to participate in the amusement area or ride an animal in the zoo. If you are looking for somewhere that your kids can just run and play out some energy after a lot of sight-seeing, this is the perfect place.",144,old
145,33,359,"Well what would say to a park that has well kept and safe playgrounds, plenty of greenspace and a zoo all for free? I say it's awesome and my children thought so too! We stayed at a hotel called ""The Classic 500 Pentaz"" which was within walking distance to the park. We found out about he park only by staying in the hotel and decided to give it a try. Glad we did as it was a pleasant day out with the family. I didn't have high expectations for a free park but this exceeded my expectations. the zoo was a nice touch. The zoo had a children's zoo area with barnyard type animals and then there was also the larger African animals as well. There is an amusement park within the park which we did not try since my children are too small but that area is at a cost which is to be expected.  One thing that was not so good was that there seemed to be many many children on school trip excursions to the park and while the small children were not a problem the older children (~15ish) were running amok on the smaller kids playgrounds which made looking after toddlers all the more important. Also the park is huge so plan how to return home before you go otherwise you'll have to backtrack to the entrance in which you came as we had to do.  If you're looking to burn a half day or so, don't hesitate to drop by this park you'll be pleasantly surprised.",145,old

We visited for seeing cherry-blossom, that's great.",147,old
148,36,367,"Best things about this park are that it's close to the city centre and so very easy to get to by the metro, and it's FREE!!!  We took line 5 on the metro which takes you to the back gate of the park, but it's still an impressive entrance gate. There were fountains by the entrance, and then more in the middle of the park which are what my daughter loved most (and she got drenched, so a change of clothing may have been a good idea). There are also several play areas, most of which are sandy, so appropriate beach-type footwear would have been better than the shoes she went in, but we'll know for next time  She didn't really like the zoo area much, and the animal enclosures did look quite small which I often think is quite sad for the animals, so I was quite glad she didn't want to spend too long in that part.  We went on a Friday afternoon and the park was quite busy with groups of school children. There were also quite a number of people who had taken picnics, and pop-up tents to shield themselves from the very bright sun (we weren't very well prepared as I thought it was going to be a cloudy day and hadn't expected it to be so hot).  We only went into 1 toilet block and ended up using the disabled toilet which had the type of toilet in that we're more used to - the toilets in the ladies were ""squat"" style, which I don't like and I knew would it would be disastrous to try to get my 5-year old to use one of them!!!!",148,old

We were a group of adult friends looking for a quiet relaxing way to have lunch and spend the afternoon. I was not disappointed because it was a pretty place for photographs. We went on 7 December 2015 and it was cold. I'm sure Spring or Summer or Fall season would be a perfect time to visit this place. The train station stop is the same name on the Green Line.",150,old

The monkeys were great, I did wonder about some of the enclosures being very small and other people have questioned it so I hope they do look after them well. Some parts of it were a bit runned down but its definately a great place to visit or walk through! They do put the animals away later in the day as we found out so keep in mind the closing times.  A Must visit if you are in the area. If you are in guesthouses nearby its a great day out without travelling too far!",152,old

The zoo was a bit old but still enjoyable..there is some rides for kids as well!",153,old
154,42,419,"The Children's Grand park is grand! It is free to get in. There are tons of different themed areas, and the entire place is covered in huge trees, so it's a beautiful place just to walk through. There's an adventure land with lots of play structures, a zoo, botanical garden, pony, donkey and camel rides, an amusement park, a marine animal exhibit, an animal show, and many more. We ate at the botanical garden cafeteria. My son and I had pasta carbonara for 6000 won each and it was delicious. My husband had a burger which was actually two smaller patties side by side, I believe his was about 7000 won for the burger, fries and drink, he said it was good, but he was not as ecstatic over his meal as I was about mine. I was just happy that they had pasta which is one of the few things my 3 year old will eat. There were many family mart vendors around so finding a drink when you needed one was easy. The restrooms were very clean and always nearby. We went to the amusement park and opted for single ride tickets, 3000 won for each ride for our son, and 4000 won for each ride for us, we only rode a few rides. My husband and I took turns on the roller coaster which was really fun. And our son rode the kiddie truck ride and the carousel. You can also buy a combo ticket for 5 rides, I believe it was 12000 won for children and 15000 for adults. Or you could buy a ride all day bracelet which I believe was 20000 and 25000 for children and adults, but those prices may not be exact. Our most favorite part of the park was the polar bears in the marine exhibit, they swim right up to the glass and being that close to such a huge animal is amazing. Also, we really enjoyed the camel ride. I rode with our 3 year old son and it was 8000 for the two of us. Our son rode a donkey by himself for 3000 won, and a gentleman led the donkey around and held onto our son to be sure he stayed on. We also went to the animal show called Anistory. It is a cross between an animal show and the cinderella story. It was 8000 for each my husband and I, and our son was free. So it cost us 16000 won to see, and although it was entertaining I didn't feel that the show was worth that much. If you go to the Seoul Zoo you should see the dolphin show, very entertaining and only 2000 won per person. We only saw one souvenir shop but didn't find anything we wanted to buy. But altogether the experience was a fun one, and I would recommend it to anyone, even those without children :)",154,old

We only made it to the monkey's and ""ferocious animal village"". Enclosures were small. Most animals did not have toys or things for their entertainment. The female lion was the only one and she looked so depressed. The elephant had nothing to play with and was alone. It just rocked back and fourth. The red foxes looked mangey and malnourished. A+ for the playgrounds. F for the ""zoo"". Free or not, no animal should be kept like that.",158,nothing
