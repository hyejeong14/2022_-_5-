8,8,311,"Namsan Tower is a Korean landmark, and it is one of the tallest towers in Asia. It offers not only a view of all of Seoul, but also a chance to enjoy a meal inside the tower. At first, Namsan Tower was used for broadcasting, and then fully open to the public, it is worth watching the Namsan Tower lock wall, slowly a wall of locks, and the lock hanging on it must be a couple together. Now, the Nanshan Tower locked wall is a very popular tourist attraction. At Nanshan Tower, the highlight is that there are interpreters for multiple languages so that you do not have to worry about language barriers. Secondly, the entertainment near the tower is also very much available, which can satisfy no longer a single view of a tourist destination but can enjoy food and shopping at the same time as viewing the landscape.",8,much
9,9,328,We visited it during weekday to avoid the long line of the cable car. We skipped the ticket line by purchasing it thru Klook. The view is much nicer in autumn.,9,much
10,10,346,The tower is interesting but probably not worth visiting unless you have a nice clear day. It was dull the day we went and you couldn‚Äôt see much.,10,much
11,11,359,"Probably outshined by Lotte Tower which of course is bigger and badder but the wait times and surrounding area at N Tower are much better. There is good food, a bar, lovelocks and a trippy colors room before you enter the tower elevator.",11,much
12,12,390,"Two options to the top of the tower, hike or take a cable car. We decided to take the cable car. After purchasing the tickets, we have to stand in a very long queue which goes up two floors to reach the cable car station. It too us 40 minutes before we got into the car. The ride was smooth, but the view from the car and from the tower is nothing special. We went there in the night expecting nice views, but there is too much light which prevents us from getting a good view of the city (see picture).  Lot of young couples around who come to 'lock their love' on the railings of the tower using a paddlock. This seems to be a popular belief. There are restaurants and souvenier shops in the tower.",12,much
13,13,398,"Perched on a hill accessible only by a town bus or the cable car, this provides a great view of the city of Seoul!  We went by cable car - and it was easy and fuss free. Climbing up the stairs you‚Äôd be greeted by a stall selling snacks. Try out the soup fish cakes... divine especially in cold weather. A little further up you will see the locks and love messages... there the Hawkeyed would Spy ‚Äúabandoned‚Äù phone cases but these have handwritten (presumably love) notes scrawled in permanent ink... we didn‚Äôt get a chance to do this ‚ò∫Ô∏è. Perhaps next round!  We purposely chose to go up later in the day just to see Seoul‚Äôs night light. If you are the sort who‚Äôd like to spot landmarks, please go before sundown.  Layout is very much like the observatory tower in Shanghai though! A good experience all in all!",13,much
14,14,402,"visited this place before but didn‚Äôt appreciated it much because too many people and long lines.. but this visit is so magical, 10am just about it opens, you can appreciate the place and better view, weather also cooperated, bright and clear sky even at a very cold temperature of -4C",14,much
15,15,411,"We stopped here as part of a tour, so we had our own usher who guided us to the elevators. The grounds are pleasant and parts of the old city wall can be seen in various places. The light show at the elevator was a bit much. The top floor with all the windows was filled with souvenir shops. Great views of the city, however",15,much
16,16,446,"Every travel guide to Seoul recommends you to visit the N Seoul Tower, but after queuing up in the long lines to take the cable car up, you are faced with another long queue and expensive tickets to head up to the observatory. Way too crowded and too much lights from the sign to get a nice night view of the city. You can give it a miss if you have other things to do on your itinerary.",16,much
17,17,454,"Too many lines. No sign posts. View of city was not clear since the glass was reflective. The view from nearby Signeol Seoul was much much better. If in Seoul, one could consider going to tick off the list but this one's quite average.",17,much
18,18,464,"One of the best viewing platforms in Seoul. Only costs around ¬£4 compared to ¬£16 at Seoul's Sky. Although the observation deck is lower the view is much more beautiful than Seoul sky and you can see all the sky scrappers which are especially nice during dusk and at night when everything lights up and there is an outdoor observatory too. Forget Seoul Sky, do this instead.  Recommended",18,much
19,19,465,"Well, you gotta do it when in Seoul, right? Trouble is, everyone else had the same idea, so it was 'rammed' at the top.  Terrific view, though, as you'd expect, although the glare from the gift shops reflects a bit too much on the windows at night-time, spoiling photos a little.  I'm glad we went; but it was just ok, and didn't 'wow'-me.",19,much
20,20,468,"We made the mistake of trusting Google Maps to get up to the tower. It took us to no man's land and our curvaceous Tongan bodies had to hike up the mountain certain someone would have a heart attack on the way. Though it seemed like a bad idea, once we finally got up the mountain we felt like Rocky Balboa or that we had conquered the world and we got much needed exercise.  The view on the Sky Tower was as expected however the highlight were the toilets with a view. Wish I had needed to go at the time because that would've been a memorable 1.",20,much
21,21,470,"We were there on a Korean holiday so it was very crowded. So much so, the line was too long to up up into the tower. We went by cart as far as we could and walked around Namsan Park. Even from there buildings below looked liked a ""Legoland"". Great perspective of the highly populated, dense city.",21,much
22,22,471,"There are 2 ways to visit N seoul tower, by cable car or to hike up. My siblings and i decided to hike up as the cable car waiting time was 1 hour. It was a long hike with stairs and its tiring. So I recommend to take the cable car if you are with kids or if you dont plan to exercise üòÇüòÇ N seoul tower itself was nice, the view was great !! üòç its mostly just enjoying the view and also chilling around that area ! So if you love looking at the views and take photographs then this is for you otherwise there‚Äôs nothing much to do.",22,much
23,23,484,"We went up by cable car and when we arrived we found the whole area looked very dated. Admittedly, there are very good views from the top of the tower but we thought there are much better places to visit than here, unless you've got plenty of time in Seoul. By all means, go and have a look but ensure the sky's clear because you'd only go up there for the views, the tower itself and immediate surrounding areas are a little underwhelming, and that includes the Hello Kitty Island experience which I can only recommend if you are a die-hard Hello Kitty fan. Even for the likes of us, who find Hello Kitty quite cute, it was not worth our time.",23,much
24,24,488,"So we recently visited the tower and I thought I might write down how we went about it and some suggestions. --------------------------------- When to go:  So we visited in early August and found that the best time to to go was the evening (of course this will depend on weather and month etc) . I would suggest you arrive at the tower by 7.00pm and be on the viewing platform by 7.30pm, as by 8.00pm it will be dark. This will allow you to view Seoul during the golden hour, sunset and night (when the whole city lights up). This will probably be one of the more busier times though, so beware. If you want a less busy experience maybe go early morning or around lunch and be don't visit on a weekend but a weekday. ---------------------------- How to get there:  We were staying in myengdong area which conveniently had a bus that takes about 15 mins to go directly to the entrance of Seoul tower. It comes every 15 mins and costs around 1,200 won without a tcard and 1,100 with. For those staying in myengdong the bus stop is to the right of myengdong Station entrance 2. The bus you will need to catch is the no. 5. Those staying in chongmyeong can catch either the no. 2 or 5. There are other methods of getting there. You could taxi or get the train to the bottom of the park and get the cable car up.  I would suggest that if you want to walk the hill/ Park area to get to the tower, that you should walk down instead of up. It is a step climb up, with quite alot of stairs and steep slopes. It would take you a good 30 mins plus to get to the top and you will be tired. ----------------------- Seoul tower Park:  So beneath Seoul tower is a sort of park area with a few viewing platforms, one of which is covered in love locks. I would recommend getting some of your photos group photos here. Its a little less busy and the view is almost as good. Beneath the tower there are many places to eat and shops. --------------------------- Seoul tower  The tickets can be bought online and at the tower. We bought at the tower and don't encounyer much of a queue. Tickets cost 10,000 won per adult and 8000 won for children and seniors. They are open tickets which mean there are no time slots allocated. You can enter the tower when you please and stay as long as you like.  There is one main viewing platform and it will be busy but the views are stunning. If you find yourself needing to get away from the hubub I would suggest you go down to the next level (sub viewing platform) and go to the toilet. Each has its own private view and the facilities are very nice.  I saw quite places to eat on each level with lots of different choices e.g Italian, Korean,  Chinese etc. I don't, however, know how much it costs. ------------------- Getting down:  When finished there are multiple ways to get down. The bus which you took to go up, the cable car and the walk. The cable car costs 7000 per adult and takes about 10-15 mins to get down to the bottom where it will drop you off near myengodon, where you can get to myengdong Station or just walk home.  However, if you are feeling up to it I would suggest walking down.  The path is well light, nicely paved with great views all the way down. It has a great view of the tower and its a nice stroll through the park area. The path is just left of the cable car when facing down the hill. I think it took us about 20 mins to get down. You will just about the reach the same area that the cable car will drop you off at. From there its a 10-15 min walk back to myengdong main street. --------------------- Worth it?  I believe so but I am a sucker for a good view and a relative payed for most of the trip. I can see how it may fall flat for many as it is very busy tourist hot spot which is arguably overpriced. I believe families should see this is as one of their big nights out. I still think those on a budget should go but maybe limit there spending by walking and taking snacks up with them to eat in the park. While Seoul tower is arguably the most iconic, there are still other platforms you can choose from. Also, if you were just viewing during the day and wanted a challenge then instead of observation decks go to some of the mountains that surround the city. We went to bukhansan (1/2 day quite hard hiking) which has amazing views.  Hope this helps people out. Sorry its so long, thought the detail would be good. --------- Protip: For those who do go in the evening (who are treating this like one of their big nights out) and finish the tower looking for dinner I would suggest going to woori Garden korean bbq in myengdong. Amazing stuff.",24,much
25,25,490,"Great views of the city. Not as tall as the Lotte Seoul Tower, but set up on a hill which gives it almost as much of a commanding view. Several coffee shops and restaurants as well as gift shops at the tower as well. Spend an hour for a quick look around or spend longer and enjoy the view while drinking coffee or grabbing a bite to eat.",25,much
26,26,496,"The smooth, safe ride up, love locks, beautiful views of Seoul city, and an experience a lot like TeamLab Borderless in Japan once you go in to the tower. It's on a much smaller scale than the TeamLab Borderless one but amazing nonetheless. You will have to pay more to go up but so worth it, the observation views are gorgeous and you really get a unique view of this special city. There's even a post office box up there that you can send postcards to the USA and other countries from. Great experience!",26,much
27,27,501,A new style of getting out and about. Very interesting place .never seen anything like it..enjoyed very much,27,much
28,28,506,"We tried to go at night but much too crowded. By day, it was fantastic. There is so much to do including the trip to the top. There were performers and restaurants and shops. It was the best day with my daughter of my entire trip to South Korea.",28,much
29,29,511,"Make the hike up if it‚Äôs not unbearably humid/hot, it‚Äôs a nice walk up from Myeong-dong, doesn‚Äôt cost much to go up, and has great views of the city! Personally I‚Äôd avoid any cafes/restaurants at the tower and head back down to Myeong-dong for food.",29,much
30,30,532,We walked from Myeongdong area to the cable car station (20-25 mins) where we took üö† (W35000 for 3 adults 1 child) to the tower ground floor.  We booked tickets at the Klook apps in advance for entering the tower which are much cheaper. It gave instant confirmation with QR code. We just need to take the physical entrance slip at the kiosks with the mobile confirmation.  There are some shops and restaurants/eateries at the Tower.  It's a popular place and must visit. We spent 3 hours here in late afternoon.  I must be back in one autumn as it will be full of maple leavesüçÅ,30,much

32,32,540,"We took the cable car up to the mountain, the views were stunning, there was much to see and the waiting time wasn't as bad as i expected took only about 5 mins on a Tue at 3PM, highly would recommend, the voucher redemption was easy as well the machines present had an English option.",32,much
33,33,542,"I didn‚Äôt expect this trip to be so much fun for my children. There were Cartoon characters everywhere which they loved to spot. There was a Cablecar ride to the top (not as hot as I thought it was going to be inside the plastic box full of tourists) they have bars/restaurants/ice cream parlours and the view is stunning on a clear day. The cost doesn‚Äôt get you to the top which I do find disappointing. You have to pay an additional cost of 11,200 at the half way point to go the all the way in an elevator to the ‚Äútop‚Äù. 3of our party did and 3 stayed behind. They enjoyed their extra trip which had an exhibition at the top. The cable cars were larger on the return journey which I found very reassuring. Taxis and busses are at the entrance if you don‚Äôt want to walk back to your apt. It didn‚Äôt feel packed with the amount of people actually up there. There is an amusement arcade half way which entertains the kids no end.",33,much
34,34,547,"Cost for a combo for two is ¬•24000 Korean Won , this included 2 adults, 2 large soft drinks and 2 large pop corns with choices of 4 taste. Beer combo cost a big more. Very popular place with tourist and local, we took cable car up there , cost ¬•9500 @ for return , not a very long ride, but a walk to the escalator before you reach the cable car station. Too much for elderly. Better take a bus to cable car station . alternatively you can take a circle line bus from the closest subway station cost about ¬•1250 @ way to the tower and no cable car . You may order the entry ticket online and get ¬•6000 which most people do. Try out some websites. The view is authentic especially the night view but the viewing deck is relatively congested. The snack bar lighting is too bright so the reflection blocked your view . Seoul is large city but not as many high raise than inHong Kong. So the night view appears less impressive than in HK. With the price is value for money . Can‚Äôt miss. Highly recommend. Even you don‚Äôt go up the tower , the ground level five storey decking is still good enough to have good view if the city . Remember go when the weather is clear.",34,much
35,35,556,"This is the best place for Seoul city night views. However, the waiting time for the cable car is quite long as it is crowded with locals and tourists. Overall, it is worth a visit if you enjoy night views. p.s. speaking personally, I think that paying to go up to the viewing tower is not really worth it as it is not much differences.",35,much
36,36,558,We really enjoyed our time there. We went up by hiring a private taxi from Klook along with the ticket to enter the tower.  If you wanna partipate in lock with your partner. I recommend not buying from there it cost to much. You can chill out in the twosome cafe and have fun.  Generally a great place to chill. If you have elderly please consider using the cable car.,36,much
37,37,561,"The tower offers great panorama of Seoul. I didn't go to the tower during my previous visits. This time my hotel was in a walking distance, therefore I decided to visit the tower. I went in the morning and walked, instead of using the cable car. Surprisingly, there were many facilities that offer food and drinks, including draft beer. Based on my experience, I would suggest to go late afternoon to have a dinner, see the panorama in daylight and after dark, and enjoy glass of beer. I usually walk a lot, however walking to the tower was too much exercise and I had sore muscles even three days after. So some people should consider cable car.",37,much
38,38,591,"I caught the cable car because it was easier for me to get to.  When you make your way out of the station at the top, you're greeted with nice views and lots of the famous love locks. The view so far is really nice and you can see quite far. I thought ""The view from the observation decks will be so much better!"" I was wrong.  You head down some steps into a concourse area where you can buy drinks and trinkets. I purchased my ticket for the observatory and waited in line for the elevator to the observation area.  Essentially I paid 10,000 krw to ride a lift and look out of windows covered in the handprints and faceprints of small children, all the while getting barged out of the way by impatient tourists.  Personally, not worth the money. Catch the cable car or walk up the steps to get nice panoramic views. Don't bother with the observation decks...  I'm giving it 3 points because I quite liked the views from the hill below.",38,much
39,39,593,"If it is your first time in Seoul and would like to enjoy an aerial view of the city, this is the place to go. I would recommend going there late in the afternoon so you can enjoy the view when there is light until after dark so you get to see the city both during the day and at night. There are several restaurants should you feel hungry and want to eat. There is a convenience store for your basic needs. If you are travelling with very small children and elderly, it may be a challenge walking up the steep hill leading to the tower. There is a portion there where there are trees where you can attach your lock as a remembrance until the next time you visit the tower. The best way to reach the top is by car, if not, bus. Taxi's are not allowed so it's a longer walk by cab. If you go up there during the colder months of the year, bring a jacket, the cold is felt very much at that height.",39,much
40,40,603,I love this place getting there was as much fun as the attraction lots to do great views and plenty of great pictures The lines can be very long depending on the time of year you visit You can walk but we took a cab and then used the cable tram to get to the top. The lines for tickets and tram can get long just keep that in mind. We spent about 4 hours at this attraction,40,much
41,41,608,"I really had high expectations of this place since I had read so much about it and being a K-drama fan, I thought it would be a wonderful and a romantic place. Well,maybe it would have been different if we went up the other way with the cable car but we went up there as past of a half-day tour. First of all, you can't get up to the tower area itself without walking up or taking a city bus or being part of a tour. No cars are allowed. That part was okay as we did go up by bus. What was disappointing was that it seemed very commercialized. There was a fee to go to the top of the tower. That was understandable but then.they take a photo of you when you enter which of course comes with a price tag. And it was extra to go into the Hello Kitty area which seemed like a promo store??? We didn't go in. Don't get me wrong, the view was nice from the top and outside where you have the love locks and park area. I guess I'm just a bit jaded because of my disappointment. Maybe it would have been nicer to go in the evening with all the lights. But to me-you do it once...",41,much
42,42,611,"Well, pretty much what you'd expect - some great views, some tacky but fun souvenirs etc. Cable car ride is fun, as is expected. Nice territory to walk around as well.",42,much
43,43,612,"Went here because I skipped it my past 2 visits to Seoul. It was quite a hike from Myeongdong to the cable car station to bring us up the tower (I forgot how much but around 9000 won roundtrip), but it‚Äôs manageable. After getting off the cable car, you can already see colorful ‚Äúlove locks‚Äù all over; you can place your own. (If you don‚Äôt have a lock they sell it there.) You can also take photos of the Tower from that area. Then there is an option to pay to get up the N tower itself. Since we didn‚Äôt want to eat another buffet meal, we only got the tickets with pizza and pasta meal for 2 (not at the top of the tower though), but the pizza especially was superb. At the tower itself, we didn‚Äôt need to stay long; 15-20 minutes was more than enough. It was fun to play the interactive booth game though, where you can say hi to people at the Busan tower. :)",43,much
44,44,620,"Other than the steep steep walk towards the tower where the padlocks are, there wasn't really much to see here. The food at the top were limited and pricey. Our trip here could have been replaced by another place but what the heck; a check mark for you now that we've seen it.  Note the treetops with LARGE bird nests and the walk path that abound with beautiful flowers including tulips  There are many stalls at the top selling assorted merchandise - all pricey :)",44,much
45,45,626,"I've been to many tower view points in my tours (Seattle Needle, Eiffel Tower, the Empire State Building to name a few) and here it was a bit disappointing.  We're reached the tower towards sunset to see the sun goes down on the city, but as the visibility was very poor due to the temperature and the atmosphere, we decided to check the tower itself. There is a deal for two at 22K W for two tickets + 2 drinks and 2 popcorn's (heavily stuffed with butter), and upon entering it looked very strange to the team there that we (as two tourists) didn't want to get ourselves pictured for an overpriced photo set (1 for 15K W and it goes on...)  Once we reached up we discovered that it is almost impossible to get a clear sight in the night because of the merchandise and internal lights that these boots are reflecting. All the surrounding windows had reflection of everything you see inside (people shopping, lights of candy stores etc.) and you could not take a decent photo with those reflections. I guess during the day it is much better, but trying to compare the pictures shown by the staff of Seoul at night makes you wonder where was it taken (on the roof top of from a different building :))....",45,much
46,46,628,"My hotel was not far away, so I walked to the cable car station, which was easy to find. I decided not to walk up the path because I have a bad knee and climbing that many stairs would have hurt. I bought a one way ticket for 7,000 won. I didn‚Äôt have to wait long for my turn on the cable car, only about five minutes (around 10:45am on a Saturday). The trip up is about two minutes in the cable car, but they reallllly cram people in that thing. The views from the main platforms of the tower were excellent and it was nice to see the love locks as well. They have lots of food options there as well. I did not pay to go up to the observation deck, since I thought it was overpriced, especially when you get such good views from the free platforms. Please note, this is a super crowded attraction, so prepare yourself for that. I then walked back down, since it is much easier going down stairs for me - walk back down took about 10-15 mins for me, going slow. Overall it was worth seeing and you could certainly do it for free if you are fit enough to climb all those stairs.",46,much
47,47,631,"Maybe it‚Äôs Labor Day holiday so there were many people/tourists. From the bottom of slope waiting for elevator up to the ticket station , queuing to collect tickets, to go up the tower station and finally to top of tower was long long queue and we waited for almost 2-3 hrs. I did not think the night view was that fantastic, for the wait it was not worth it for me. We also queued an hr to wait for lift to go down. Bad experience, by the end of the night, my legs were aching so much. The staff there were not doing anything to make the wait more efficient. Maybe it is better if it is not public holiday.",47,much
48,48,648,"Seoul tower offers the most amazing & complete ariel view of the city unlike any other place. However one needs to be careful before going up, since if it is foggy then its a waste as you wont be able to see much. Interesting fact - the tower itself uses lights to indicate whether the visibility is clear or not, so its a good practice to watch for the lights and then make your way there. You can get to the base of the tower for free, which itself is good enough to get a splendid view. But if you want to spend money, you can pay more and make your way up the tower which as a restaurant with a better 360 view. There are two ways to get there - you can trek your way up a nice path or take the bus. The only downside is that it is super crowded, and you need to jostle for space to get a decent view.",48,much
49,49,677,"N Seoul tower is a great way of viewing Seoul. Cheap, very accessible thru bus or hop on hop off bus. We used our Seoul pass to enter. There's a restaurant, gift shop and of course their observatory viewing floor. Try to use their washroom, even in there you will be enjoying the view. You can also rent hanbok and get your picture taken thru their photographer. I forgot how much is the picture but it's a reasonable price.",49,much
50,50,685,"Well, what to say really? Yes, it's obvious what the place is, it's a VERY popular tower on top of a mountain with viewing platform and restraunts up there. An yes, Korean restraunt up there was really nice and I'll review that separately. But as for the tower, the queue for the cable car up was easily 30 minutes, problems more like 40 plus, and this was a Sunday night. Don't be fooled by the queue for the tickets on ground level, that's just the start of your long, long quest to the top of the building, to get the cable car to the top of the mountain. I call it a quest, as it's almost something worthy of two small hobbits. I had read reviews that mentioned the queues, however I didn't quite read in enough detail to prepare for the queues that lay ahead, and I'm British, we're known for queueing, but I now think we should be handing that title for the Koreans. Then, once you finally get on the cable car and get to the top of the mountain, you can stop and have a look at the views from there, and then queue a further 40 minutes for the lifts up the tower proper. Now a good tip here, is to book a restaurant package to go up the tower, as this skips the lift queue up for you. View from the top is nice, but without the restaurant meal, it would have menat 80 minutes plus of queueing to get there. Then, to come down, repeat all the queuing again, so it was 40 miuntes to the bottom of the tower, which sadly the restaurant meal does not enable you to skip, and then another 40 minutes for the cable car. I know there's a bus to the top that misses the cable car, and we didn't try those so can't comment. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also climb the mountain on foot, althouh we thought that for an evening dinner out that might be a bit much. Overall a nice view, if you patient enough for the queues.",50,much
51,51,698,"I've been here twice, once in the evening and once in the day. From the entrance to the tower, you can appreciate the cityscape of Seoul and it's a great view. It doesn't cost much to go up the tower (only 10000 KRW per person, plus there is a bundle of 2 popcorns + 2 beers for 26000 KRW which we availed of). The top of the tower itself was quite small, in terms of circumference. Only housing a candy store and a souvenir shop were located at the main viewing deck, with a non-advertised coffee shop at the lower floor which we would've gone to and stayed at if we had only known (they're the only accessible non-restaurant establishment with seats). It was a great experience but it's more than enough to go up the tower once, no need to do it again and again.",51,much
52,52,725,"One of the place that I looked forward so much, but, ended up being so disappointed. It did not appear as charming and nice as my expectation. Ticket is a little on the pricier side as well, but, the hike up to the N tower was worth it, the view of Seoul from above is just breathtaking",52,much
53,53,736,"Had a great trip to N Seoul tower. We walked all the way to Shinsegae mall, turned left, and walked about 5 mins, we took the elevator provided. Because it was freezing so we gave up walking up the hill all the way to the tower.. we took the cable car instead. The view was spectacular especially during the winter. We brought our own keypad lock because they‚Äôre selling for much a higher price at the tower. Overall, the experience was great and we enjoyed it.",53,much
54,54,755,"Great view of the whole of Seoul but not much to do up in the tower for the price we paid (W10.000). Nevertheless, it was still a nice experience.  I would recommend going up half an hour before sunset so that one can catch the view of Seoul both in the day and night view.  There‚Äôs also a postbox and postcards and stamps sold in the tower so that you can write and send postcards from the top of Seoul ;)",54,much
55,55,783,Can view how the city is divided by the river. Contrast of old and new building. Meantime have the famous corner of locks.. u can see messages of people to their love 1 or couple. Since we follow tour. We don't have much time to walk around and read but we have nice view as you can see from my pictures. Love the winter view. Imaging it full with snow. Even more lovely.,55,much
56,56,788,This area is walking distance from the Myeong-dong area (about 15-20 mins). You then have the option to ride a cable car up or to walk up to the Tower. The cable car is just a few minute ride so we opted to walk. It takes about 30 minutes to walk up (much longer for us as we kept stopping to take pictures of the view!).  We did not enter the tower itself (there is a fee) but we enjoyed the scenery at the top. There are some restaurants at the bottom of the tower.,56,much
57,57,792,"We booked the tickets to the observatory tower at N Seoul Tower through Klook as its cost around SGD6.50/pax, much cheaper when compared to purchase onsite. If travelling by taxis, you have to stop at the cable car ticket booth and travelled up by cable car or by bus. Its better to reach around 10am to avoid crowd as the queue for cable car can be long. After getting off the cable car, please proceed to B1 of observatory tower to print your ticket using Klook barcode issued to you. We spent less than 30 mins at Observatory Tower as its very small and crowded. I feels this can give a miss. The love-locked area is good enough for you to walk around and take some decent photos of the views.",57,much
58,58,799,"This tower is pretty much the same as any tower you find throughout your travels. The unique thing about it is around it. Leading up to the tower are hundreds of locks with couples names on them that are locked on the guard railings. There are some restrictions for those putting theirs up and if you don't follow their rules, your lock will be removed at the end of the night. Good view from the tower of the City but like every other tourist stop, a bit over priced. Entrance fee is separate from the cable car ride getting there.",58,much
59,59,816,"Well, what to say really? Yes, it's obvious what the place is, it's a VERY popular tower on top of a mountain with viewing platform and restraunts up there. An yes, Korean restraunt up there was really nice and I'll review that separately. But as for the tower, the queue for the cable car up was easily 30 minutes, problems more like 40 plus, and this was a Sunday night. Don't be fooled by the queue for the tickets on ground level, that's just the start of your long, long quest to the top of the building, to get the cable car to the top of the mountain. I call it a quest, as it's almost something worthy of two small hobbits. I had read reviews that mentioned the queues, however I didn't quite read in enough detail to prepare for the queues that lay ahead, and I'm British, we're known for queueing, but I now think we should be handing that title for the Koreans. Then, once you finally get on the cable car and get to the top of the mountain, you can stop and have a look at the views from there, and then queue a further 40 minutes for the lifts up the tower proper. Now a good tip here, is to book a restaurant package to go up the tower, as this skips the lift queue up for you. View from the top is nice, but without the restaurant meal, it would have menat 80 minutes plus of queueing to get there. Then, to come down, repeat all the queuing again, so it was 40 miuntes to the bottom of the tower, which sadly the restaurant meal does not enable you to skip, and then another 40 minutes for the cable car. I know there's a bus to the top that misses the cable car, and we didn't try those so can't comment. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also climb the mountain on foot, althouh we thought that for an evening dinner out that might be a bit much. Overall a nice view, if you patient enough for the queues.",59,much
60,60,834,Here's the scoop : don't take a taxi. Just take bus 02 or 05 from some areas around the city including Myeongdong and it brings you all the up to the base of the tower. It's only 1200 for adults 350 for kids. Same thing when you are returning back. The cable car is 7000 one way for adults and connects from the base of the tower to a middle station. For us we have been in many before and it didn't justify the short ride. Spend some 1-1.5 hours at the base of the tower and take in the beautiful views of the city. The weather was great and we took lots of photos. And we didn't pay to go up the tower because every country has a talk tower and it's pretty much the same üòÄ,60,much
61,61,835,"Another reviewer said ""...Yes, there is a cable car. But the hike is very easy - it's reasonably flat and you get pretty good views all the way up."" That is what it said in the book on Seoul that I bought in Honolulu before going to Seoul. My wife and I found the opposite to be true. I took as 3 hours to get from where out taxi dropped us off to the top. In retrospect there was a Bus stop sign at the bottom but no idea when it might come so we elected to walk. Three hours later (with seven yellow busses passing us going up during the time it took us to walk there) we arrived with my wife very sore legs and mad. ""Reasonably Flat""... I don't think so.. I would call it steep.  Once we finally arrived it was nice. We went to the upper level W 10,000 each, and got a framed souvenir photo W 25,000 which was nice... you can choose your background of views from the tower.  Unfortunately, it was very cloudy that day, and we couldn't see much of anything of the city from the tower, but they did warn us about that before charging us to go to the upper level, and after that hike we wanted to go up anyway. I think i would be spectacular when it is not cloudy... it was just our bad luck the weather was like that. I hope someday we can go there when the weather is good!  We enjoyed the fence where the lovers attach the padlocks with their names together and took some pictures there, and the Vanilla Shake at the Ice Cream concession was delicious.  We decided to take the cable car back down, which was scenic, but we found that once we arrived it was a long walk to MyongDong Subway Station, which the map implies was colocated with the Cable Car terminal... it is not. It is also a steep road from the Cable Car terminal down, so if you were going to walk up from the MyongDong Subway Station to the cable car terminal it would be quite a hike... although certainly less than the alternative hiking trail.  If we go there again I would either: 1. Wait for the Yellow Bus at the bottom of the Hiking Trail where the taxi dropped us off ... I think he sign at the top said the Bus was only W 1,200 or something like that.  OR 2. Insist that the taxi take you all the way to the Cable Car terminal... and get the hotel or somebody to write that in Korean to show the driver since it appears none of the taxi driver's understand English.  The fare for the Cable Car is almost the same for round trip as one way, so IF you can be sure the taxi will take you all the way to the Cable Car terminal that is probably the best choice. Otherwise the Yellow Bus from the bottom of the hiking trail.  Aside from that I agree with all the other observations of the review by EmmaVestrheim.",61,much

We went in the early evening and saw things in daylight and night light. One thing that we didn‚Äôt realize was that it‚Äôs kind of a romantic place fire couples to go and place a lock with their name on it on the fence. Locks are available to purchase there or bring your own. Food is available there. Anything from grap and go good to sit down resturant. Take the cable car to the base of the tower,64,much
65,65,907,"We went to N Seoul Tower after our palace trip. I can honestly say that the place is over-rated. They have this area where couples can put locks and write something on the locks, i guess a wish that the relationship lasts long. Forgot how much i paid but i feel that it was more than what the place offers. But we went anywhere...went for a train and a bus ride which was very easy to follow. Still worth a go but again is a little over-rated. And the locks being sold on-site costs between 6500-8500w!!! A little pricey",65,much

Ended up, we could not see much of the view and have to constantly get ourselves as near as to the glass and kept wiping the condensed glass. We also felt that the deck was more like a souvenir shop as it was very packed and the walkway was narrow.  Other than that, the line was long too. So there were waiting, lining, waiting and lining. Pretty standard for touristy spot.  Would recommend to just view the skyline at Namsan Park instead. The sunset was good too.",69,much

Don't expect much from this ride except transportation only. We bought the round ticket. I would recommend only getting a one way ticket. It's quite an easy walk down. It takes about 15-30 mins. There are lots of photo points along the way which the cable car does not offer. Also the wait for the way down was at least 30 mins. It was chaos. We did go up the tower in the elevator. I have to say this part was a waste of money. The views from the first level were amazing. Going up the tower doesn't enhance the view that much. Also it was mayhem in the observation deck. You barely could make it to a window spot and the glass was covered in handprints and smudges. Don't be fooled. The wait for the elevator up was only 15 mins. Coming down was over an hour!

Go a 360 degree the whole tower and you see how far is North Korea which is just over the mountain in Seoul city. We followed a private chartered one day Seoul city tour, therefore I do not how much is the entry ticket cost.",110,much

There are viewing points as you go up that are great for getting good pictures.  Once at the top, there are many restaurants, a cable car (which we came back down with) and an observation deck costing W10,000 for access. We went up to the viewing deck, but this was inside, with glass splattered with rain drops and light reflecting from the various tourist tat sellers - basically not really worth the money, the time as it didn't give a much better view than what we'd seen already and yielded poor quality photos.  Over all, worth it for the walk up and scenic views, but not for the observation deck!",112,much

I spent less than KRW20000 for a return cable-car ticket, a cup of latte and an ice-cream; and I was done taking photos around the tower in less than an hour. Tips for those who wish not to spend much money there - just power walk to the tower, don't take the cable car :)  The park is very well maintained/kept. The view of Seoul from the outdoor observatory was just breath-taking. The love-locks are pretty to see. There are restaurants/cafes/stalls as well as souvenir shops. At a fee, the observatory in the tower can be visited. It is worth a visit as it's a symbol of Seoul after all.",115,much

I have been to Tokyo tower and the tower in Shanghai, I am not a big fan of these towers, but I feel bad not visiting them as they are seen as such a big attraction. To me, all three of these towers feel the same. The view isn‚Äôt that spectacular either, just a typical city view. So I guess it is worth going if you enjoy the tower view, otherwise, I think it is ok just to take photos from the outside without going to the observatory deck.",121,much
122,122,1425,"I was not intended to go to the Seoul Tower. I just made a dinner reversation for a restaurant at 5th floor of the Tower, so I visited the Tower. Before I went there, I read many reviews of other travellers here, and they said you should be ready for long queue for the cable car. So I reached the cable car entrance amost 2 hrs in advance of my dinner booking. Out of my surprise, I did not need to queue at all, I just went there, bought the ticket, then I could go up to the entrance. I waited only for a few minutes, the cable came.  I thought that the cable car would be kind of individual cabinet, but it is not. It is a big one, no seats, able to accomodate 20-25 persons standing inside.  Cable car should be the best way to go to the Tower. I saw many people coming with big tour bus, and they needed to climb up to the hill. Anyway, after I had arrived, I saw many visitors, most of them are mainland Chinese, not very crowded, but noisy.  There are several gift shops and chain restaurants, but nothing special not buy, nor nothing good to eat here. You could take a lot of pictures with the ""love locks"" if you come with your another half.  There, you could buy the ticket to the observatory which is on the 3rd floor. I do not recommend it, though the elevator is interesting. Nothing much to see in the obvservatory. There are very few souvneirs shops, but trust me, the commodities are not interesting to buy though I was ready to, and intended to buy something.  But still, you could have a lunch / dinner at the korean restaurant.  There is also a chained coffee shop, called TWOSOME+, do not go. There is only one staff, so he is always busy and impatient. He might not be good at English, and when I ordered a drink in English, he misunderstood, and gave me another thing, I requested him to exchange, he became even more impatient and the atitudes were bad !  There is a wish pool right next to the coffee shop. I could hardly see something there. Who will throw money into such ""fake"" pool??????  After spending 1 hr on this boring 3rd floor, I went to the destination of this ride - 5th floor - N Grill (french restaurant), which was perfect in service and environment and food.  The view there is wonderful.  I recommend not to go up to this tower, unless you want to spend most time at N Grill. And if you go, it is better to be dinner time. The night view is fantastics. And when you leave, you can see the Seoul tower at night, which is more beautiful than it is during daytime.",122,much
123,123,1429,"We headed here at night to check out the lights of Seoul - and it didn't disappoint. It's a pretty cool attraction, granted, there isn't much to do here (the time we went - early Jan) but the view is nice.  The cable car ride up is fun, and the elevator up to the viewing platform is well thought of - the graphics and concept is a great idea.  There are a few restaurants and caf√©s around, with a neat little souvenir shop - be sure to purchase a tile, and be part of the tile wall. Also - buy a padlock and join the hundreds of others to lock your love on the gate surrounding the building.  The snow covered city below was an awesome sight, even though it was bitterly cold outside when we were there - it was completely worth it!!  Definitely worth checking out if you're in Seoul.",123,much
124,124,1433,"We reached N Seoul Tower by cable car, which happened to be the most exciting part of the visit to the top. It's definitely not the best/coolest tower I've been too, as CN Tower (Toronto, CAN) still ranks in my top 3. I describe it more as a short tower on a big hill. As well, we couldn't see jack from the view as it was extremely hazy.  There were plenty of activities on the plaza as it was kind of touristy. As we were about to leave the first time, they started setting up for a martial show which turned out to be pretty cool. Other than that, I was ready go. Not much to see, overcrowded, and hazy.  If you're in Seoul, I do recommend you check out the tower. It's kind of like Hollywood, you got to see it once. Maybe you'll have better luck/viewing than we did. Cheers.",124,much

Restaurants are expensive and even the souvenirs. But what we enjoyed more is the area where people leave locks spreading messages of love especially couples feeling so romantic. You'll see them seated in benches whispering sweet nothings to each other. It was cold and windy that night in September, 2013. Really a good time for couples in love. Another attraction we visited was the Teddy Bear Museum. It was awesome seeing them in all sizes, in different costumes, various themes and some, in action. You really would spend time taking photos not only of these cute bears but photos with them. It was fun. When we were about to leave, there was this light show of the tower itself. So we watched it and enjoyed it although it wasn't extra ordinary. But as a whole, the experience was good.",129,much
130,130,1475,"The North Seoul tower is an excellent way to get good views of the city. We first travelled to Myeong-dong station (line 4 light blue) & exited on #3 which by luck put us right at the transfer bus ( free) up to the cable car ride to the tower. You just have to wait untill the bus is full before it goes. It runs every half our, so just wait if you think you have missed it. It is a green & yellow mini bus. The cable car is one big car that takes about 20-30 people (which is well legal) & it's KRW8000 for a return trip each adult. Once you arrive at the top of the cable car ride it's a reasonable climb ( a million steps according to my missus) to the tower. By going this way there is no disabled access but you can access the Tower by the Seoul City Tour bus if you are getting around in a wheel chair. Once at the Tower there is a variety of things to look at even if you don't want to go up into the viewing platform. There were performers of different sorts, viewing platform, & shaded trees to sit under. The entrance fee to the top of the tower is KRW9000 each for an adult. I thought it was KRW20000 each but when i bought the tickets it was only KRW18000 for both of us-bargain!!!. The ride to the top of the tower is quick & there is a corny video to watch to take your mind of the ride. The view form the tower is quite good but i would suggest being there on a smog free day or you won't have much to look at. Even when we went it was a very nice day but visibility was about 5-10KM. Plenty of trinkets to buy & there is the usual super imposed photo in front of the tower. Quite easy to dodge that one as we didn't speak Korean.You can spend as much time as you like up there & the ride down is as quick as going up. When you're at the bottom of the tower, check out the padlocks of all the gestures of love. Quite impressive really.",130,much
131,131,1487,"Come here in the afternoon just before the sunset the views are amazing and the city comes to life! Watch out if the weather is bad you cannot see that much also on Sunday most offices are closed so the city is not as lit up with the buildings as during the week. Its considered to be a romantic spot so you will see a lot of locals having a romantic stroll around the tower. There are also a lot of restaurants around so you can have a diner and watch the city. Two ways getting there: a cable-cart ride which takes about 4-5 minutes or a walk up, which many locals prefer as its free and healthier rather then the cable-cart. Just after sunset on Sunday while I was there there was a sound and light show on the tower wall which was kind of fun. Highly recommended place and there is a Teddy Bear Museum somewhere close to the tower.... I did not have the time to look for it but I bet its fun as the tower!",131,much
132,132,1490,Locks left by lovers hoping to lock their relationship forever filled the railings of N Seoul Tower. Beautiful sight with benches that are bended in the middle. Great place for photo taking. We took the cable car up and visited the teddy bear museum inside as well. Very cute and informative about the history of Korea during the Joseon and Silla era. We were there during Summer and Korea kind of conserves energy a lot so the place is rather stuffy without much air condition and it's really hot and humid. Try to go when it isn't that cloudy. We went all the way up but it was too cloudy to have a good view of the entire city. Beautiful nonetheless. :),132,much

The entire location is based around love and romance so really I recommend couples to go here. If its cloudy its not recommended to go atop the tower, as the clouds often hit the top of the tower but not as much the base. Of course winter is the best time to go as visibility from high places is always better in cold weather.",133,much

But you can use a bus all the way to the top of the mountain. Don't be afraid to ask koreans where you can get the bus to seoul tower. Bus fee is much less expensive and fun to experience korean bus, safe and clean..not bad. The sight is always beautiful but best in fall when leaves turn red and yellow.

137,137,1525,"We heard that the lights at night were an amazing sight, but we chose to go there after lunch to see the details of the city. We had lunch first in Myeongdong then walked up going to the cable car. The cable car ride costs KRW6000 for a one-way ticket and KRW8000 for a return ticket. We purchased the one way ticket so we can experience the trail going down the mountain. There was still a bit of a climb going up but there were areas that you can rest, take pictures, buy snacks and enjoy the view.  A major to-do in this site especially for couples is to leave a lock with a love message. You can choose to leave the message in the fence or in metal trees. There really is no rule on how to leave your message -- we saw a lot of curious things attached to the fences such as cellphone cases, lunchboxes, keychains, etc. I already brought a used metal padlock from Manila, but we needed to buy a permanent marker and chose a waterproof bagtag from the souvenir shop to write our message. If you don't have a lock, the souvenir shop sells different colored locks (surely more expensive had you purchased it at your local hardware store).  We bought the bundle package tickets to the Observatory and the Teddy Bear museum (KRW14000/adult). The Teddy Bear museum was a cute way to learn about Seoul's history and the Observatory gives you probably the best panoramic view of Seoul. Near the ticketing area, there's a traditional Korea martial arts demonstration that happens every 3pm. Quite cool to watch.  Going down was a very light hike. This was the same trail you'd take if you will not take the cable car, but judging from the facial expressions of those going up they looked very exhausted halfway up.  The whole experience took about 4 hours to complete, but I'd think some people would probably take much longer if they will choose to eat in the restaurant there.",137,much

You can certainly do it - but no one tells you about the initial initiation into the Seoul Tower hiking club!!

144,144,1596,"Having been to Tokyo Tower, the N Seoul Tower did not give me the ""wow"" experience when I went up to admire the night scenery. It could be because there wasn't much to look out for when at the top. The view at every angle seemed the same to me. Perhaps it could be better if there was a guide pointing out the landmarks to spot when viewing from a certain part of the tower. The only prominent feature I could identify was probably the Han River.  There are also hourly light shows that will be beamed on the tower itself, starting from 8 pm. But honestly, you can skip it and head straight for the tower. It is nothing fanciful.  The place, like every tourist attraction, is full of people, and waiting time to get up to the viewing gallery can span up to 30 minutes (and that was when I visited on a weekday), so I suggest that you avoid weekends or public holidays, which in my opinion, will take even longer.  TIP: Tower admission fees are 9000 won for adults, but you can enjoy a 10% discount if you use the coupon provided when you purchase a Seoul City Pass Plus (their public transport card, but specially for foreigners) card.

The views are breathtaking, go at night, on a clear night and you can see pretty much all of Seoul.  There is a souvenir shop, a minimart and several restaurants.  There's an hourly light show on tower, that was fun to watch.  The keychain memorial was pretty unique and good to see.

Though a complete tourist trap, if you do want an overview of the hugh metropolis that is Seoul this place is definitely worth a visit. Other than that I do have one more recommendation: Do not miss out on the view from the washroom. (I am speaking for the gents..For a similar experience/view comparable to this, you have to go to the top of a medieval hill town village hundreds of feet above the Mediterranean- Eze, in the Cote d'Azur. The washroom of the restaurant/cafe called the ""golden goat"") While coming down the hill we unwittingly got into a fake taxi that was waiting there to trap foreign tourists. This was the only time in Korea when we got robbed in a cab. (In general our experience with taxis in Korea had been good) A journey to Itaewon that should cost around 5000 won(about $5) turned into ten times as much.( Hint: You try to get into a parked cab. The driver points you to a car behind. You assume that is also a legitimate taxi. It does have a meter. Only one that wouldn't stop jumping for even a split second.

If you are travelling with very small children and elderly, it may be a challenge walking up the steep hill leading to the tower. There is a portion there where there are trees where you can attach your lock as a remembrance until the next time you visit the tower. The best way to reach the top is by car, if not, bus. Taxi's are not allowed so it's a longer walk by cab. If you go up there during the colder months of the year, bring a jacket, the cold is felt very much at that height.",159,much

161,161,1765,"Went here because I skipped it my past 2 visits to Seoul. It was quite a hike from Myeongdong to the cable car station to bring us up the tower (I forgot how much but around 9000 won roundtrip), but it‚Äôs manageable. After getting off the cable car, you can already see colorful ‚Äúlove locks‚Äù all over; you can place your own. (If you don‚Äôt have a lock they sell it there.) You can also take photos of the Tower from that area. Then there is an option to pay to get up the N tower itself. Since we didn‚Äôt want to eat another buffet meal, we only got the tickets with pizza and pasta meal for 2 (not at the top of the tower though), but the pizza especially was superb. At the tower itself, we didn‚Äôt need to stay long; 15-20 minutes was more than enough. It was fun to play the interactive booth game though, where you can say hi to people at the Busan tower. :)",161,much
162,162,1784,"Seoul tower offers the most amazing & complete ariel view of the city unlike any other place. However one needs to be careful before going up, since if it is foggy then its a waste as you wont be able to see much. Interesting fact - the tower itself uses lights to indicate whether the visibility is clear or not, so its a good practice to watch for the lights and then make your way there. You can get to the base of the tower for free, which itself is good enough to get a splendid view. But if you want to spend money, you can pay more and make your way up the tower which as a restaurant with a better 360 view. There are two ways to get there - you can trek your way up a nice path or take the bus. The only downside is that it is super crowded, and you need to jostle for space to get a decent view.",162,much
163,163,1818,"I've been here twice, once in the evening and once in the day. From the entrance to the tower, you can appreciate the cityscape of Seoul and it's a great view. It doesn't cost much to go up the tower (only 10000 KRW per person, plus there is a bundle of 2 popcorns + 2 beers for 26000 KRW which we availed of). The top of the tower itself was quite small, in terms of circumference. Only housing a candy store and a souvenir shop were located at the main viewing deck, with a non-advertised coffee shop at the lower floor which we would've gone to and stayed at if we had only known (they're the only accessible non-restaurant establishment with seats). It was a great experience but it's more than enough to go up the tower once, no need to do it again and again.",163,much
164,164,1838,"One of the place that I looked forward so much, but, ended up being so disappointed. It did not appear as charming and nice as my expectation. Ticket is a little on the pricier side as well, but, the hike up to the N tower was worth it, the view of Seoul from above is just breathtaking",164,much
165,165,1846,"Had a great trip to N Seoul tower. We walked all the way to Shinsegae mall, turned left, and walked about 5 mins, we took the elevator provided. Because it was freezing so we gave up walking up the hill all the way to the tower.. we took the cable car instead. The view was spectacular especially during the winter. We brought our own keypad lock because they‚Äôre selling for much a higher price at the tower. Overall, the experience was great and we enjoyed it.",165,much
166,166,1889,This area is walking distance from the Myeong-dong area (about 15-20 mins). You then have the option to ride a cable car up or to walk up to the Tower. The cable car is just a few minute ride so we opted to walk. It takes about 30 minutes to walk up (much longer for us as we kept stopping to take pictures of the view!).  We did not enter the tower itself (there is a fee) but we enjoyed the scenery at the top. There are some restaurants at the bottom of the tower.,166,much
167,167,1891,"We booked the tickets to the observatory tower at N Seoul Tower through Klook as its cost around SGD6.50/pax, much cheaper when compared to purchase onsite. If travelling by taxis, you have to stop at the cable car ticket booth and travelled up by cable car or by bus. Its better to reach around 10am to avoid crowd as the queue for cable car can be long. After getting off the cable car, please proceed to B1 of observatory tower to print your ticket using Klook barcode issued to you. We spent less than 30 mins at Observatory Tower as its very small and crowded. I feels this can give a miss. The love-locked area is good enough for you to walk around and take some decent photos of the views.",167,much
168,168,1897,"This tower is pretty much the same as any tower you find throughout your travels. The unique thing about it is around it. Leading up to the tower are hundreds of locks with couples names on them that are locked on the guard railings. There are some restrictions for those putting theirs up and if you don't follow their rules, your lock will be removed at the end of the night. Good view from the tower of the City but like every other tourist stop, a bit over priced. Entrance fee is separate from the cable car ride getting there.",168,much

170,170,1925,"Spent the day hiking and visiting the N Seoul Tower.  GETTING THERE Yes, there is a cable car. But the hike is very easy - it's reasonably flat and you get pretty good views all the way up. Once at the tower, you need to buy a ticket to go to the observation deck. There is a shopping mall below, so choose to visit that either before or after the observation deck. Then you join the queue, get your photo taken (optional), and then take the lift to the top. Once at the top, there are three different floors full of restaurants and shops.  Tip: If you have Lonely Planet, they have an excellent self-guided walking tour that's very easy to do. It includes a visit to the Old City Wall.  CROWDS It's *so* crowded. Be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes in queues for food, shops, and finding a spot to take photos.  VIEWS Incredible!  Tip: Want to get good views but be away from crowds? We went to the Hancook restaurant where it was VERY quiet. We then sat there, ate slowly, and watched the sunset from our own table in our own space. It's much better then nudging people out of the way on the main floors.  FOOD First we got beer + chips from a coffee shop, and the chips were laughably bad. Then we went and hid in the Hancook restaurant, which was a little overpriced but nice and quiet. We got our own table overlooking the city.  SOUVENIR SHOPPING Some of the best souvenirs I've seen in Seoul! Did all my shopping there.",170,much
171,171,1928,"I generally skip towers when I visit new places because I have been to so many and they tend to be just waiting in line, going up for two seconds and then going back down. This one was a much nicer experience. There is a cafe at the top and you can kind of hang out for a bit. Also, the area at the bottom of the tower was really nice and had great views as well.",171,much
172,172,1949,"Our trip to N Seoul Tower was so exciting. At first, we were worried that we might get lost going there, but with available online maps, we were able to arrived there so easy and fast just by train and bus. Once in the N Tower, process in going to the view deck is very organized that even too much people were there as it was I guess peak hour (6pm), the piles and waiting took us more or less 30-45mins. The view of the whole Seoul was awesome during the night. There are lots of instagramable picture perfect locations around N Seoul Tower specially those with their loved ones. Surely, would still love to be back to see and enjoy at daytime.",172,much
173,173,1953,We visited the tower in the later part of the evening and did not have much of a line at all for the cable car ride up to the tower. The view was beautiful and clear and a little windy. I would definitely recommend this to someone visiting Seoul for the first time. They have a gift shop at the top for you to check out.,173,much
174,174,1963,"I was lucky to choose a warm, sunny day in October to visit the North Seoul Tower. Having explored the surroundings under the tower first, I then bought my 10.000 Won ticket and rode the fast lift to the observation deck. The young lady in the lift asked us all to look up to the ceiling of the lift as we started to ascend and the film then took us on a journey much higher than to the top of the Tower - we continued to climb up beyond the earth's atmosphere and into space. Very clever...  At the top I enjoyed stupendous 360¬∞ views over the complete city and way beyond. The sky was beautifully clear and you could see for miles and miles. I liked the fact that at one level you could orientate yourself to your home city/country and one level below you could spot the local sights.  The gift shop at the top was well stocked. I really appreciated the chance to buy a postcard or two with the postage stamps already inserted in the envelope. I just needed to buy an extra stamp to cover the postage back to Europe. And there is a postbox at the top of the Tower. All well thought through. Oh, I forgot to say there is free, strong WiFi connectivity up here.  For me, this is a must for any tourist itinerary of this fascinating city.",174,much
175,175,1964,"The tower gives a great view of the city, most specially at night. It's a great place to hang out and take photos. It was so cold and rainy when we visited the place but it still had so much fun.",175,much
176,176,2009,"This was a perfect way to end my long day, after much sight-seeing around the city. The views from the obsevation deck were magnificent. I would recommend giving it a visit and if you have the extra to spend, go straight to the top.",176,much
177,177,2016,"N Seoul Tower is a landmark of Seoul because you can pretty much see it from everywhere. And it's just so beautiful! I had the advantage of staying at a hotel with a terrace that was faced right at the tower and every night seeing it was like magic, along with all the city lights. The view from its top is also very beautiful, too bad that we were there on Chuseok and the crowd and huge lines of waiting were exhausting. But still, I do recommend visiting it.",177,much
178,178,2030,"We took the cable car up to the top. The price for adult is 9500 KRW for a round trip - rather expensive taking under consideration that you will spend aprox. 1 minute in the cabin and there will be not much to see from it. Then, we got to the top of Seoul Tower, where you can admire AMAZING views and take some neat pictures. However, its next 10000 KRW for an adult. During your trip to the top, you will be obliged to pose for two photos, fortunately, you dont need to purchase them (15000 KRW each, sick!!). On your way down, you will be also ""distilled"" through a gift shop - as the staff is hoping that you will be also tempted to buy some more overpriced things :P  All in all - the beauty of Seoul is here, expensive, but worth it. However, I cannot say I enjoyed the aggresive money extortion during our visit.",178,much
179,179,2032,We went up using a cable car. The place is busy with tourists and has lots of love locks. It has a beautiful view of the city. But nothing much to do so allocate 1-2hrs only in this place. We went up the tower and had a good Korean dinner. The tower is a sight to behold at night.,179,much
180,180,2073,"I went to Namsan Tower twice, both of them on the last week of June. I visited it at night time and on the afternoon the next day afterwards just so that I will be able to witness the night view and day view. The night view was kind of a shame to be honest because it was very foggy so we weren't able to see much of Seoul's skyline. However, the day view was really amazing. Also, Namsan Tower had a lot to offer. I went to the observatory and had the 360 degree view of Seoul. The love locks were great, considering the number of locks that were in there. It was such a shame that I was alone when I came to visit. They also have the hanbok experience which I greatly enjoyed. It's definitely one of the must visit when you're in Seoul.",180,much
181,181,2103,"For me there are too many people. It is somewhat interesting to get on top and to see Seoul from that hight. But there is not much to do up there. After Lotte Tower was built, this Tower became even less attractive. If you are really interested, you can go one time. But it is not in the top 20 things to do in Seoul. To make it interesting, do the trekking from Botanical Garden or Dongguk University up the hill to the Tower.  Also crowded on weekends like everything else in Seoul.",181,much
182,182,2116,"I went on a Thursday night on a bus (not many people using the bus which was good) around 8 pm. The evening was humid with some light rain. When I got to the bus terminus by the tower, the sky was still clear enough for some good night view of Seoul. By the time I got up the observation deck of the tower, it was very noisy and crowded with people, with loud music playing in the background, and bright light inside which cast strong reflections on the glass. All these kind of ruined the night view and made the visit very unatmospheric. Then mist set in and everything was shrouded. I stayed for a short time and left. I have visited quite a number of high towers in different cities and many offer great views day and night. This is probably the worst experience I have had so far. I guess it would be much better if I go during the day on a weekday when the weather is fine.",182,much
183,183,2137,"The view from all around the tower is great and could not ask for better, however you do not need to actually go up the tower. The surrounding views are great on their own and doesn‚Äôt get that much better that it is worth the money. Besides up top is just a massive tourist trap. There are some shops and stuff at the base of the tower that are neat and a Starbucks for your caffeine fix. So overall would make the trip to it again to see the surrounding area but not the top of the tower.",183,much
184,184,2138,"There are a lot of cliche things to do in big cities, and visiting their ""tallest buildings"" is one of them. But this was truly a nice experience. From the lush setting to the fabulous views, it is very much worth the trip. Plus, you can take a tram to get to it. As Miranda's mum would say, ""such fun!"" Not only do you get amazing views of the city, but you can send postcards all over the world! They provide the postage. Make sure you have enough memory free on your phone - you will be taking a lot of pictures. Also, right before the elevator to the top of the tower, the staff take a picture of you that you can purchase later. Very expensive and not worth it. I saw signs that said no pictures, but everyone was. They sell popcorn like you are going to the movies, like this is an EVENT. Inside the elevator they play a short clip that you watch on the ceiling. At first I didn't understand why, but it makes sense. How awkward would it be to be crammed in a silent elevator with 10 other people trying not to make eye contact? Great for the whole family. Tons of food options too. Also, if you are with your boo, you can leave a lock on the railings like the French used to do on the Pont des Arts bridge in Paris. Very cute.",184,much

There's also a place here to hang padlocks for couples, and there are couple benches where you can take pictures of you and your partner. Maybe kids can enjoy running around, but other than that, there's not much.  As for the view from the tower itself -- it's just the view. There are no explanations for what you see (maybe a brief history of some key places would be great!), and I think there were no audio guides either. That's why I give this place 2 stars.  If you do decide to go up though, make sure to try the bathroom, where you can get a good view of the city from the comfort of the toilet bowl ;)",193,much

I hardly could take decent shots of the skyline as the glass were blurred by the reflections caused by the bright lighting from the candy and souvenir shops on the deck level. To make matter worse, the attendants could not speak English when i asked for direction to get down from the tower. So, don‚Äôt expect too much from this dwarf tower,",194,much

Just don't expect the food to be more than average, and don't be shocked by the high prices - just remember, you are there for the view. If you are there for anything else, you will be disappointed.

199,199,2231,"When in Seoul, one must visit the N Seoul Tower because.. ""when in Rome"". I'm rating this a 3/5 because of the challenges my family faced when visiting this landmark:  1. We were travelling with my mum who can't walk much. According to multiple taxi drivers, they were not permitted by law to take passengers up. This meant that Mum had to slowly hike up the hill, and mind you it wasn't the easiest of hills to walk up to.  2. Again, mum couldn't walk much. There was no direct access to the top of the tower. Once we reached the hill and boarded the slanted elevator, there were still a series of stairs to climb to finally make it to the entrance of the tower. It was rather handicap-unfriendly.  3. You'd think that after all that climb, the view would be spectacular but it was pretty average. The entrance free to the viewing deck cost KRW10,000 per person and it was indoor. Perhaps I am biased but I thought The Peak in HK was a lot better, must it was outdoor and far more breath-taking.  4. Getting back down was another challenge as you can imagine.  I would still recommend this for those travelling to Seoul for the first time but probably best to go during the cold weather (otherwise you'd be sweating away), you are wearing comfortable shoes, and are not bounded by toddlers/prams/elderly.",199,much

There're multiple bus number which can bring you back to the main city esp if you stay at Myeongdong. Just look at the bored for the location that you're going and wait for 10-15 mins for the bus. The interval is very fast. Very convenient to go there by public. Mini shopping centre below the deck where to can eat or buy drinks like bubble tea but don't expect much from it as the main attraction is still the observation deck. There's also an arcade.

Went to check it out in Oct, it was great because the weather was good and sunny. We walked slowly up the hill to get on an elevator lift to the tower (free). Then reached mid upper hill had to buy a return ticket (or single one way up or down - can hike up or down the hill) cable ride to the tower. Negative was the staff will filled up the cable car (packed sardines :/) with enough tourists then start the ride. Enjoyed the great views but not really while in the cable car because can't move around to take pictures. When reached the hill top, there were steps to walk up. There was a lock place, where lovers can buy locks to write their wishes and locked it around the fences which was so romantic and a vending machine to sell flowers. After had to walk up few more steps up and there was a Korean dressed up guard standing there and behind 2 more guards were marching each side of the huge big vases (those were for guards to lit those big vases when enemies entered their provinces -old time). Because it was mid autumn festival, there was a stall that let visitors to put on Korean traditional costumes (free) then took pics with the guards. At the tower, visitors able to buy just visit the tower platform, or tickets that include hello kitty museum and comic characters museum. Both museums are small but kids loved them so much. Up to the viewing plateform, the views were magnificent and spent long time to see how Seoul formed. Seoul was surrounded by mountains, palaces were along those mountains, buildings were not tall and able to see the new develop areas and old areas. Slight dissapointed - did not have places to sit and no much service facilities if compared with Lotte world tower (from namsan world tower you can see the Lotte world tower is right opposite to each other).

It was also crowded when we were there, and we saw a very long line for those who are taking the cable car.

The line to enter and to buy your ticket is about 90 min, very long line. when you are in the line waiting, along the way you will find some people selling stuff like food and drinks which I think is a very good idea. when you get to the ticket centre the staff there speak English.And the way up is by elevator, before you go on the elevator they show you a short clip but they keep replaying the clip so it becomes boring. when you go up in the elevator when you come out of the elevator,the view comes and there is a candy shop on your right but tits really expensive. overall the view is nice but there isn't much to do other than take pictures. I recommend you going to the N Seoul Tower if you have never been to it, or Korea itself!",211,much
212,212,2480,This tower is not very prominent in Seoul's skyline because of its small size. The actual experience was much better than expected because it makes up for this in views. It seemed like I could even see N. Korea from here. Be prepared for lots and lots of steps if you decide to walk. There are meal/ticket packages that make dining much more reasonable. Be sure to see the free cultural performance outside if you can.,212,much

The tower itself is not tall. The entrance fee is expensive as it does not offer much different from the sightseeing spots at the hill top.

There are a lot of restaurants beneath the tower.",216,much

218,218,2563,"The tower its self is great. We much more enjoyed the 2nd level as it was less crowded and you got a nicer view, the 2nd level also had more information unlike the top that just seems to be about getting kids to ask their parents for lollies.  We took the cable car up. They PACK the people in so if you dont rush to a side of the cart you basically cant see anything. The cart ride isnt great so if i was to do it again i would just get the bus up.  Once you get to the base of the tower its then more money to get up. I understand they need to pay for everything but it really does feel like a tourist trap.  The view was great and Id recommend going at sunset so you can start to see Seoul light up and do its thing  Worth going but dont stress if you dont have time",218,much

At the end of the week I tried again and I was so glad that I did. I used the cable cars to gain access which offered great views. At the end of the cable car ride was a performance area, food bar and more views. Then I purchased a ticket to go up to the tower it was nice with more great views, picture opportunities and a gift shop.",219,much
220,220,2590,We've been in many towers around the globe and this one probably excited us the least. Though you can have a good view of the city and maybe the sunset timing in a clear sky day would make it much better. There is a free shuttle bus which can bring you there from the nearest subway station to avoid climbing the hill walking. Ask your hotel for information. The cable car cost 8500 and the tower ticket another 10000. Almost 20 USD/pers - maybe a bit too much... Enjoy!,220,much

Maybe the activities would be fun for a small child, but I was not entertained. The toy museum and the hello kitty museum just looked kind of pathetic from the outside, so we didn't pay to go in those. The arcade was sad, mostly claw machines (we had already experienced a claw machine arcade and lost several thousand won because the claw jolts too much).",221,much

From Myeongdong station, it's not a long walk to the cable car station, though it is all uphill with a decent set of stairs at the end. There is also a shuttle bus from Myeongdong station to the cable car but we just walked. N Seoul Tower should definitely be done at night, when the tower is lit up and so is all of Seoul. One of the most amazing things about the tower is definitely the bathrooms, make sure you pay them a visit before you head back down! We didn't spent long at the top, it's actually a pretty small area, there is a small gift shop and lolly shop, however the gift shop at the base of the tower has a much better range.",222,much

It was earlier in the morning so no line at all. The cable car ride only took about 10 minutes. You're in between trees so the view is just ok. I would have preferred to walk up and recommend it for anyone who is capable and willing.  Walking around underneath the tower, there were some areas with ok views. Unfortunately it was a little smoggy that day so you can't see very clearly for long. We got a couple ice cream cones and sat in the back with tables and panoramic glass window looking towards Gangnam. Unfortunately the would be relaxing experience was many times ruined by people dragging chairs across the concrete that creates the most horrific high pitched sound.  Given the less than ideal visibility, we didn't pay additional to go up to the top of the tower.

There is lots of stairs up to where the tower is. You can definitely walk. I am not that athletic but it was ok to walk up. I rested few times. There was a place to take pictures half way up....good place to rest your tired legs. Don't forget to bring water!! When I was up there the tower is....i decided NOT to go up on the tower. Bcuz the wiew was so awesome at where I was that the tower it self was not needed. Ofc for those that want to go up to the tower....its worth it I am sure....but I just sat there on til of that mountain...under the tower and watched ppl and the wiew. That was one of my best moments in Seoul...so lovely! I drank coffee at the cafe and the wiew was like a dream! I warmly recommend this experience! I walked down the mountain too....it was much easier to go down üòä,224,much

Luckily we had a sunny evening so we were treated to stunning views of the sunset over Seoul. You are very high up and so the views are amazing. I thought the Observatory Deck was pretty much the only attraction but I was really surprised to see that there is actually quite a bit to see and do there with a lot of shops on each floor. So I recommend you allow for about 2 hours of time there. Getting there is very easy, cable car or a bus. If by bus, take the number 2 bus from Chungmuro Station (outside the cinema) and it takes about 20 minutes to the Tower stop. From there it's a five minute walk uphill to the Tower.",225,much

I'm glad we didn't take the cable car for the queue going back down was insanely long. The bus brings you right up to the base of the tower. This tower should be nicknamed Seoul's or Namsan's Love Lock Tower. The variety of, the shapes they form and the insane number of love locks stretch along different walkways are supported by zones - Heart Lock zone, Shiny Love zone, love seats etc. And if you are lucky, you might catch the filming of a love scene like we did!",236,much

It is advisable to go very early during the day if you want to head up to the N Seoul Tower as it can be very crowded. We walked to the ticket office, and the walk up isn't too bad. Waiting time for a ticket is about 30 minutes. Then another 30-45 minutes to the cable car. If you are super fit you can walk up to the N Seoul Tower, otherwise the walk up is not for the faint hearted. When we arrived at the ticket box there was an ambulance collecting someone that had collapsed from the walk. Once you get up to the tower there is a lot to do- shops, eateries, children's activities, marital arts demonstrations and much more. We stayed here for about 3 hours and then walked down. It was about 20 minutes walk down, but you felt sorry for the people walking up, as it is a long walk. This is a must see when in Seoul.",240,much

I went there alone yet still enjoyed myself very much.  Buy ticket to go up to the observatory deck of the N Seoul tower at the base. The staff will guide you through. You can buy ticket which includes dining or beer but i did not.  I was there from evening til the sky turned dark. Beautiful view. Nice souvenirs at the observatory deck as well.",241,much

The tower offers a variety of attractions and although we never made it inside it just shows how much there is to do. We got to the tower by taking the subway to Seoul station and left through exit 9. We then walked a short distance forward and the shuttle bus stand was there where we took a shuttle bus straight to the park. Other ways include the subway to Myeongdong and a cable car. You can't take a taxi or a car there as they are trying to reduce the pollution to protect the area.  Once at the location you walk up a HILL to get to the actual tower. Wear good shoes guys! There is lots to do there before even paying to get in the tower (which happened to us because of time constraints). There were different dances and sword fighting displays with a running commentary of South Koreas historical background. This is offered in both Korean and English. They include the audience quite a lot which is great fun! I found myself laughing at the comedic side of it!  There is lots to eat ranging from lunch to dessert and snacks so you won't go hungry.  The iconic love locks are also there. For 8000 won you can buy one or 12000 won you can buy a set of two locks, both come with a free marker pen. You then go to write whatever you want and lock it up on the tower forever! Its an amazing thing to do as it feels like you're leaving a part of yourself in Seoul.  This was all done without paying an entrance fee to get into the tower. Unfortunately we never made it inside due to time constraints but that shows there's a lot of fun stuff to do! Definitely visit there, just give yourself a good amount of time.",242,much

Pay some money again for the tower and on the top is kinda small. Comparing with Tokyo skytree or Tokyo tower, they seem to have more to offer.

We had a cup of coffee to warm ourselves up before going to the top point of the tower. There are several shops and restaurants there but unfortunately, one of the store owners (located on the first floor) selling accessories and souvenirs was not friendly. Nevertheless, we didn't let this affect our mood. The scenery at the top is so beautiful. It was nice and we bought quite a few souvenirs from the store there. We also visited the Hello Kitty Island located on the first floor which is so adorable. We all love Hello Kitty & Friends. We spent about an hour there taking pictures. My kids enjoy it so much and have been sharing with their daddy (who missed it) since then lol...he is so jealous about it. We will be going there again (and with daddy this time of course)!",247,much

When I was there, I went for 3 packages which includes the Hello Kitty Island (a too much pink-ish place for people who are hate pink), Ssen Toy Museum (yassss! Marvel fan, Star Wars alert!) and Observation deck!..Surprisingly at the Hello Kitty Island was a fun place to enjoy..while the Ssen Toy Museum a place that so amazing..imagine the life size of iron man..okay i need to stop..so the last stop will be the observation deck was well yeah..if you used to go any ob.deck so just the same... when i went down, the surrounding for this tower as you already knew, the lock-ish for couple things, but also good for taking pictures!",249,much

The way up was nice and I got a lot of cool videos and pictures.  We didn't have time to explore the ground floor of the tower (I did see a hello kitty store tho) but Im pretty sure there were a couple of restaurants or cafes down there. We quickly discovered that you also had to pay to actually go up in the tower which was annoying (since we had already payed for the cable car) but it didn't cost that much. We also had to wait in line to get to the elevator, maybe 15 minutes or so. The view is very pretty once you actually get up. You can see the whole city!! Everybody was taking pictures but the windows till didn't get too crowded. There was a candy store and a souvenir shop on the inner side, I didn't buy anything but there was a wide range of different goods. Overall the trip was fun. I've been to Burj Khalifa so it wasn't that mind-blowing for me but you got a cool view :) We decided to walk down but you can obviously also take the cable car.

Second time my friend and I went there during noon time on a weekend so we waited for as long as 2 hours to get to the cable car and everything. Make sure you plan well and avoid the weekends as much as possible if you're planning to visit Namsan Tower. However, day time visit offers a different view and better overall experience so it really depends on what you're looking for.

N Seoul Tower is one of your typical observation towers among its brethren - e.g. Space Needle, CN Tower, Calgary Tower, etc. And like these other observation towers, they do provide nice views of the city (probably the best time to arrive to these towers is a little before sunset) at a steep cost.  My first annoyance was the shuttle that they provide from Myeondong (line 1) is very confusing. I waited at the stop and the Namsan Cable Car station shuttle came by. My original intention was to take the bus directly to the tower as it was cheaper than the cable car and I heard not so positive reviews of the cable car. The bus driver, who was clearly English deficient or purposely deceitful, told me I was in the correct bus - then promptly dropped me off at the cable car station. I have to imagine that this is a scam, as you then have no other alternative to get to the tower other than using the cable car. The cable car cost is approximately $7.50 USD vs app. $2 USD for the bus ride. So I relented to buy tickets, only to have to wait around 30-45 minutes for a chance to ride the cable car up (be aware of the Disney-like lines which hide the true wait time).  The cable car itself was standing room only. The views going up were a bit disappointing and IMHO not worth the extra $5.50 USD. You can see a nice view of Myeongdong, but you don't get that super wide panoramic view of the other parts of Seoul. The ride is short as well - app. 3 minutes!  I arrived a little after sunset, so that may have tempered my opinion of the place as the views were much more limited at that time. You do have views of various areas of Seoul, as well as an area where people chained these love locks to a fence (similar to a bridge in Seattle), various restaurants, souvenir shops, etc. I didn't realize the Alive Museum is there (I went to the one in Jeju and wasn't too impressed).  We decided to purchase dinner for HanCook restaurant, the buffet restaurant at the tower for approximately $88 USD for two. The only nice thing about this is that the price includes a trip to the top of the tower. I have a separate review of the restaurant, but I can easily summarize the restaurant as terrible. I was able to walk around the tower after dinner - there isn't too much unique to see in the tower itself. We then took a walk around the area at the base of the tower - and again, there isn't much unique to see in terms of shops or restaurant.  We took the cable car back down - the wait was much less. The trip down was uneventful. However, I arrived back at the cable car station base a little after 8:30 PM and unfortunately, the last bus to Myeongdong departs at 8:30 PM! Obviously, the cable car station ticket office doesn't warn you about this. Accordingly, you are left to the wolves - in this case, the taxi drivers. I didn't want to walk back to Myeongdong so I approached a taxi driver for a ride back to Myeongdong. The taxi driver immediately indicated it would cost me a 20000 won rate up front, $17 USD for essentially driving less than a few miles (and actually, Myeongdong is literally only a mile or two away from the Namsan cable car station)! I should have called an UberBlack car at that time instead of taking the taxi... But the lesson is - beware of the Seoul taxi drivers!  Anyway, N Seoul Tower should probably low on your priority list of Seoul attractions as there are many other worthwhile attractions to go to.",269,much
270,270,3188,"The N Seoul Tower was an interesting site in that it seemed to offer different people different things. There was an element of fun mixed in to the back drop of the great views of the city plus the trees and nature that is the Namsan Park.  I didn't go up to the observation deck itself. I chose to stick to the viewing platforms around the tower which provided multi level views of different sides of the city.  One of the striking elements would be the love locks that are pretty much every where. A lot of couples come up here and the sheer number of locks is a testament to that. Whilst I came here during the day time you can imagine during sunset and the evening that this would be site for many couples seeking a romantic respite from the city below.  Around the tower itself, aside from the park, are restaurants and cafes that give you the opportunity to just relax and enjoy the environment. For families aside from letting the kids run around for a bit there are fun characters to take photos with.  Whilst I wouldn't necessarily say it's a must see I'd suggest choosing a time of day that meets the objectives of your visit whether it be as a group, family, couple or Individual and just enjoy chill out and enjoy yourself.  Note: I took the cable car up and a bus down. The walk from the metro station to the cable car station is very steep so take it slow walking up or consider getting a taxi if you're with people less mobile.",270,much
271,271,3190,To visit Seoul tower is a most because The view from The top is magnificent. If The weather is clear you can see allmost The hole city. And dont forget to buy a love lock before you go up(it's much cheaper down in the city). The lock is for couples in love and you can put The on allmost antingen upthere,271,much

273,273,3202,"For a first time visit to Seoul, it would be good to consider the N Seoul Tower as one of your destinations. Of course, there are other similar places such as 63 Building for instance, but N Seoul Tower would be the easiest for a first time visitor.  To get up to N Seoul Tower, you would have to get to the Namsan Cable Car first. The cable car itself is about 15 minutes walk from Myeongdong Station. The cable car will get you up to the top of Namsan Park in about less than 5 minutes. However, be prepared for a wait of about 30 minutes at least during peak hours. Of course, there is the walking option from the bottom if you do not wish to wait that long.  If you wish to take a good shot at sunset or at night, I would say that it is actually better to take it from Namsan Park right outside the N Seoul Tower, rather than at N Seoul Tower itself. As we went during sunset time, it was quite crowded even outside N Seoul Tower itself, but the views are quite amazing even then. I would advise coming early to get a good view.  We went up to N Seoul Tower and found that the views are great, but there is not really too much difference from the views outside N Seoul Tower though. Because of the glass panels at the observation deck, it can be a little difficult to take photos without having reflection in it. It is better to go during the daytime if you wish to go up to the N Seoul Tower in my opinion.  There are a few restaurants serving those who are hungry for a reasonable price, along with a good view of the Seoul skyline as well. Overall, I would say N Seoul Tower would be good to visit once, but there are probably other better places to view the Seoul skyline, perhaps even for free too without the crowds.",273,much
274,274,3217,"We are residents in Seoul since 4 years and we went every year more as twice up to the tower. It was a nice green place within a busy town. I remember 3 years ago it was a relaxing walk up and down and also the tower area was quite peaceful. Somehow I have the feeling it is worsening year by year. The operator has started to renovate and offer now several floors with shops, restaurants and whatsoever. Some of them opened and just closed again. LOL. Why? Because probably not many people will spend a penny there. There are mainly interested in making selfies. That's it. And who shall buy all these things you really don't need? We went there and left every time at least 50k for tower entrance and a beer, coffee or ice cream. There were a few shops totally enough to serve visitors. And usually you climb up to have a nice few and not to drink and eat whole day long. Anyway this time is over for us spending any coin there. This year every time we visited the place it was totally over crowded. If you want to visit tower's upper floor you shall wait at least an hour or even more. Especially on the weekends. Same way down. I can be wrong but since 2015 it changed dramatically. We usually walking either up or down along the small road. I remember the time when we saw many people using the bike to go up. Time is over. Now every minute some old diesel engine is rushing uphill to unload and to come back to collect again. Some of them are driving fast and reckless. If you have kids you are mainly busy with watching them because you are afraid that something happened. I really wonder why Seoul citizens are not doing much about it. Did they gave up already? Do they like how it is? This place becomes really disgusting. It has nothing to do anymore with a nice, beautiful, quiet, green, park and place. It just became a polluted place of commerce. We will not visit again. We are done with this tower. Have fun.",274,much
275,275,3218,"Useful for getting a feel of the layout of the city, but not much more than that as a foreign visitor. There aren't really any landmarks I was particularly interested in seeing. And it's not even in the top 5 of the tallest towers in the world. The smoggy haze also limited what would be seen.  The best part was seeing Hello Kitty World with my daughter. We were the only ones in there at the time and had a blast being silly, and taking a ton of silly pictures. Coming from the US, Hello Kitty World is a novelty item for us.",275,much
276,276,3221,"We rode the bus to the top...but many people were huffing and puffing their way up the steep and winding road. Once on top, you can walk around a bit to get your bearings, and head over to the ticket counter to buy tickets to the observation deck. The elevator takes you to the top and you can spend as much time as you like taking in the view of a very, very crowded city of skyscrapers. It is hard to believe the amount of people (10 million) who live in the city until you see the vast spread of high rise living. Next, go down a level, that I think is actually better than the top level. Go down to the bottom and spend time looking at all the love locks.....they are EVERYWHERE. We rode the cable car down ..just for the fun of it. Otherwise you can use the steps to get back down to street level or catch the bus.",276,much
277,277,3231,"Came here in the evening to see the night skyline. The cab fare from Myeondong area to cable car station is about 4800 won. Beware on return there were some cab drivers who demanded 20000 won because these are the waiting cabs. Don't give in, just wait for those that drop off passengers to this spot. It is a bit much to walk up in the dark narrow road. So take the cable car. Be sure to stand at the windows of the cable car to see the view going or coming down. You have to pay a separate entrance fee to go up the Seoul Tower. The sight up there is just ok, but I guess as a one time visitor you ought to try. The souvenir shop at the top and the lighting inside distract the view towards outside at night. While there, do not miss the locks of love at the foot of the tower. Now that the famous love locks at the bridge in Paris near Notre Dame cathedral had been cut and removed, you should visit this one.",277,much

I made the mistake of not doing my research and going on a Korean national holiday, so it was really crowded. I waited an hour and a half to get to the top, and when I got there the NBurger restaurant had run out of burgers. So, if you can, make sure to go on a weekday when there isn't a holiday.  It was well worth the trip up.",278,much

281,281,3337,Go here at night because the light from the city is splendid. The only thing bringing my rate down from a 5 is that the fact that there is to much background light in the tower which is ruining the photos if you don't press your camera against the window. It would have been nice with an open air platform without a window.,281,much
282,282,3340,"Well, we have visited many Sky Towers in different cities in our walk around the world and every time when we come across a new one, we would not hesitate to visit it because the view on the city will be different and will gain unique and wonderful experience.  So in our recent Seoul trip, we decided to visit the N Seoul Tower. It was about past 4.00pm when we arrived and the place was still crowded with visitors mostly foreigners. The viewing point on the ground floor was already awesome and it was built on top on the hill. Along the way, we saw trees with ""LOVE LOCKS"" besides the the mental railings that also have such locks too! It was so colourful and impressive! Unlike the love lock bridges in European cities, mostly located above a river where one would throw the keys into the river after locking it, right here, there is no river but one can throw the keys down the hill! Haha. (you can actually buy a lock in the souvenir shop)  Upon entering the tower via the main entrance, we immediately saw a souvenir and gift shop with a lovely Hello Kitty display at its entrance and no one could withstand the temptation for not taking a photo with it.  Our fullday city tour guide had gone to the ticketing booth to get us the ticket to the top while we were busy taking photos with the Hello Kitty!  Then we took the elevator to the top (according to our guide, the tower was about 250m tall, about 80 storeys if I didn't remember wrongly). While most elevators in other Towers are standard and quite ""boring"" while moving upwards, the ceiling of the elevator here has astonishing moving animations (that depicted moving into the space galaxy) and it was indeed impressive. So everyone in the elevator were kept occupied and so focused on it and forgot the ""time spent"" in getting up there. (anyway, it was quite fast too, think less than a minute)  When we arrived at the top, wow! The view here was spectacular! We walked around 360 degree and really have had a great bird eye's view on Seoul, could see the Gangnam area (South of the Han River), Myeongdong etc. As the sky was still bright, the view was cleared! We really enjoyed the view so much!  There is also a souvenir and gift store right well where you could grab some candies, t-shirts, postcards etc here. Though the place is touristy but they had some promotions and so the items we grabbed here were still reasonable in price.  After our visit here, we took the elevator down to the 1st storey where we had to walk through a ""tunnel"" with LED TVs on both sides featuring Seoul in different times and development phases via computer graphics and animations (on the other side, they also have TV screens that show the history of the country as one walks around). It was very interesting and fascinating and no doubt why Korea is so advance in IT and technology!  Well, if you like heights and good city view from the top of the world, this place will be relevant and good for you. As mentioned earlier, each sky tower is different and offer different and unique views on the city and so it's unfair to compare with one to another. Visit with an open mind and with the feeling to see and experience new and different things, your visit here will be fun, interesting and wonderful!",282,much
283,283,3355,We prefer night visit as the tower looks amazing with its colourful lightings. There isn't much to see inside the tower except admiring the city of Seoul in 360 deg. Of course you can leave without noticing the Love locks everywhere.,283,much
284,284,3357,"Going up any tower like this will provide the best views of the city. You can walk up but is a hard climb. Alternatively you can get the cable car up. The prices are moderate, but you can't miss this. There are tours which also take you up, this cost much more.",284,much
285,285,3364,"Got a entrance package that cost W26,000 with 2 entrance tic, 2 beer and a popcorn. That was the worst pop corn i ever had! But the rest was good. Not a very fascinating tower with a lot of people fighting to take picture at the window, so not much peaceful place for you to get a peaceful high view from top. Which I believe is the same in most part of the towel in the world. If you do not want to buy a ticket, just walk around the towel at the place where the tourist hang the lock. Is another nice place also, but free. Oh, the towel has transparent toilet....",285,much
286,286,3377,"Fascinating place to visit. So much more than just the view, which would be worth the visit on it's own. The walk through the park was very peaceful, but very steep in parts. If that is a concern the cable car is a less strenuous way of getting to the top.",286,much
287,287,3393,"It is a nice view even from the decks without going up the tower. You can have a beautiful view of Seoul especially when the weather is bright and clear. When we were up there, there was also a performance and also the opportunity to wear Hanbok (traditional Korean attire) for those who are interested. Namsan is the place where people would put their lock of love and leave it there. If you forgot to buy one prior to your visit, there is a souvenir shop which sells those locks and gifts too.I would say you can buy cheaper locks before you get up but I guess the locks up there are fancier. My family and I decided to not go up the tower since it was foggy the day we visit. We figured it wouldn't be worth a visit as we couldn't see much, either. I would strongly recommended to go either at night or on a clear day so that you can get the most out of your visit. A foggy day isn't exactly they best but if that is the only choice you have, just staying at the deck would be enough.",287,much

We planned to arrive during sunset and the hotel I was staying is pretty nearby, so we decided to walk on over. The walk up to the cable car station wasn't bad at all, probably because there is this elevator/ramp hybrid thing that helps you up this last steep portion. The cable cars were really cool to ride in although they do kind of pack you in since there are a lot of people.  Once you get to the top you have to climb a few more flights of stairs, which isn't bad, but may be for those with mobility issues. Once you get close to the top you can start to see all the locks of love. There were quite a few vendors selling locks so those looking to lock their love last minute don't have to worry. The view below the tower is really gorgeous although it was a bit windy when we went. There are quite a few restaurants/shops around the bottom of the tower for those who are hungry from the climb.  The tower costs an additional extra to go up to and we bought the package deal in which popcorn/drinks are included. It's funny how they play this scene that you're blasting off to space as you ascend in the elevator. Once you get to the top of the tower, it's pretty much a 360 degree view of Seoul with souvenir shops in the middle. I like how on each window it tells you how far you are from a major city in the world and it's nice to sit down and chill next to a pretty view .  There's not a wholeee lot to do here besides admiring the scenery, but the entire experience was definitely worth it and fun!",317,much
318,318,3847,"Twice I've been there during winter. I love walking up the slope and looking at the scenery and how the trees cast shadows on the path. I'm not sure how it'll feel for summer though. The wind can be a little too much for winter and high altitude. I think u have to go up the tower itself so that you won't get blown away. Same, I think scenery up the tower is best when you go just before sunset so that you can enjoy 2 different feel.",318,much
319,319,3855,"Hit the cable car walk round the summit once then bail.  Amazing views, inexpensive with a sweet cable ride in & out.  Highlights: views Lowlights: not much education as to why it exists.",319,much
320,320,3873,This attraction isn't the cheapest in Seoul but it's definitely good if you want great views of Seoul. The first time I went it was foggy and I couldn't really see much so they give me a ticket to go back. This was good for me because I was in Korea for a year but not so good if you are only there for a short period of time. So it's definitely worth checking the weather before going. I've been both day and night time. During the day it's a nice walk through Namsan Park up to the tower and there was different games and activities going on outside of the tower. On the night time the tower is lit up and the views from the top were amazing! So it really just depends what you want to see. I've walked up and took the cable car. The walk was nice but can take a while so again it depends if you like the walk or just want to see the tower. The restaurant in the tower is nice and you can get a combo ticket for a meal and entry but it is also very expensive. There's a gift shop in the tower also.,320,much
321,321,3875,"Seoul tower was amazing! The views were great and there was so much to do inside the tower like take fun pictures, eat and of course shop! The hike to the tower was fun although tiring for those not in the best shape, but worth it!",321,much
322,322,3879,We didn't feel much great here. Its like normal mountain where you can find city view. Its not unique things for sure. I think its suitable for couples.,322,much
323,323,3885,"The views were good and the facilities - restrooms, eating/dining were good and there's a plaza that is currently being constructed. I enjoyed the view from the top - however it wasn't that much better than the view from the hill, so I'm not sure it justified the price tag!",323,much
324,324,3892,I once visited this place with my father and siblings. Being here was so pleasant and fun. Me and my siblings had so much fun. This place reminds me of the time I had with my family.,324,much
325,325,3908,"We decided to take the cable car up and walk down. This was indeed the correct decision. If you decide to walk up be prepared for a tough climb. There was a 30 minute queue for the cable car and we were jammed into the car like sardines, but still it got us up to the tower OK and without breaking a sweat.  At the tower we were a bit confused about which ticket to buy. There was the observation tower and a combined Tower and Pavilion ticket, but it was not clear what the Pavilion actually was. Finally we bought a beer package which was access to the observation tower for 2 persons and a beer each for 26,000 in total. Not bad considering the tower alone would have been 20,000. cheapest beer we had in Seoul ha ha. You need to collect your beer though before you take the elevator to the top.  The views are pretty average. Its not like the Eiffel tower where you are looking down on so many historic places. Here you pretty much just see a concrete jungle.  When we came down we bought a lock and wrote our message on it and hung it on the fence. Kind of quirky but we enjoyed it. Finally we walked down to the bottom which is very enjoyable and recommended.",325,much
326,326,3939,"It is easy to get to N Seoul Tower (travelled by train, forgot the station name, Tourist Information is very helpful if you ask them). It is a beautiful place, very scenic, I think everyone who visits Seoul should go to. Remember to have your camera. I recommend this for anyone however, for those with leg problem, they can only stay around Seoul Tower as the staircase is very very long to get to the top to look at the love lock. We had a great time there and took lots of pictures. My family and I enjoyed it very much (despite the bitter winter).",326,much
327,327,3955,Visited twice. 1st time went up with bus & 2nd time went up with cable car. The view is beautiful. Love this place so much.,327,much
328,328,3966,"The views of the city are beautiful & there is some space for kids to roam around. We have visited in the daytime& it was foggy but we could still see well, and we have also visited at night, which offers its own beautiful view of Seoul. The gift shop has fun little souvenirs. Get directions on taking the bus here. It is much easier, especially when visiting with children. The tram is fun, but too much waiting & walking, so we prefer the bus .",328,much
329,329,3970,"I've been to Seoul multiple times, but never made it up to the tower until this last visit. It was pretty much what I expected (def. not lacking on cheesy-tourist stands/tchotchkes), but I'm giving it 4 stars still because of the absolutely gorgeous views of Seoul. They even have little map lines on the windows so you can see what neighborhoods you're looking at... Plus you ""blast off"" to space in the elevator which is pretty hilarious and awesome.  Just for the views alone, I'd recommend everyone going at least once!",329,much
330,330,3977,We took the Cable Car up to the mountain then the elevator up to the observation deck. You are asked to look up in the elevator and watch a corny spectacle on a TV above you and are told that it takes 30 seconds to the top. Nice view. Best to go on a clear day when there is not much fog. Very people with a lot of people.,330,much
331,331,3981,We came here during cherry blossom - we took cable car and the view was lovely. Nothing much to see in N seoul tower though but it still attract both local and international tourist (like us). It famous with amongst korean drama fans (like me) so yes we take a visit there.,331,much
332,332,3990,"We visited N Seoul Tower at the end of a gray day, so the views were compromised; however, we had a blast! The best fun was the ride up in the cable car. It started snowing and this was quite beautiful. As it was a bit dark out, the views weren't much and the tower itself pales a bit compared to Taipei 101 or the Tokyo Tower, but it is still fun, just a bit touristy. The coup was in walking down through the park. This was a joy and perhaps the most fun of the trip. The tower I could take or leave but the fun of wandering down from it was relaxing and fun.",332,much
333,333,3995,"We truly enjoy hiking to the top of Namsan to the tower. It is a good climb and we finish it off with a churro and ice cream or a burger. As you are climbing, cut off the main trail and onto the smaller trails through the trees. It is steeper, but much faster and more fun.",333,much
334,334,4043,"My family and I decided to take the hike up to the N Seoul Tower rather than the cable cars since it had about a 2 hour wait. The hike can get steep and considering how out of shape I am, it was exhausting! You get great views with this hike, and many photo opportunities which I really enjoyed. Once we reached the top, I was just happy that I no longer had to walk! Hah. We purchased our tickets, ant it was about a 1 hour 15 minute walk. We ate at one of the restaurants that offered burgers and beers. All very delicious! We bought the ticket package that offered a free soda and popcorn. And man, that was a lot of popcorn! Completely not necessary. Once we got to the top, it was extremely crowded. The glass were extremely dirty so it was hard to get a good look out. The wait for the elevator ride back down took about 40 minutes. I am much more of a fan of the 63 City Tower.",334,much
335,335,4080,Went to the N Seoul tower area at night time. It was not too crowded so made for a nicer viewing experience. It's not overly cheap for a ride to the top but it's a rather nice view. It's worth a visit if you want a nice view of the city. Can take as much or as little time as you like.,335,much
336,336,4088,We walked uphill to reach the tower. It was good exercise and a much needed one too! The view from the top was breathtaking!,336,much
337,337,4100,"The view of N Seoul Tower was so perfect for couples in love, with all the paddlocks they left behind to show how much they loved each other. The time I were there a feeling of loneliness suddenly set in. Becasuse I lost my husband 16 years ago. But after seeing lots of couples enjoyed taking pictures at that romantic place, I was relieved of the loneliness and feel very happy for them.",337,much
338,338,4101,"Came here in mid November and still had a great look of Autumn leaves. If going to the tower is your thing, it is 9000 won per person without any deals. I breezed through it as there is only so long you can look at city views. On the other hand, the base of the tower gives good enough views at all 360 degrees and there's restaurants and cafes to spend time there too. I highly recommend at least taking the 30 minutes walk down after you're done. You save some money and is a very pleasant walk. Lastly, choose a clear and sunny day, otherwise there's nothing much to see.",338,much
339,339,4110,The line up to the Observatory will take about 40minutes. Once at the the tower I was in awe seeing all the city lights. The view is awesome. But there isn't much activity so after a few photos taken we went back down. It takes more time to line up than staying on top of the tower for the view of Seoul City,339,much
340,340,4119,"We took the Seoul city tour bus up to the tower. You still have to go up an incline to get to the base of the tower. The place is quite crowded with many tourists. And it is a bit of wait to go up. It's extremely expensive. It is not much different from visiting the Empire State Building or the CN tower. When we were there, one of the women's toilet exploded. Quite gross, but not much you can do when someone overstuffed the thing.",340,much
341,341,4124,Went here yesterday and finally after 3 hours managed to get to the top of the n tower. Be prepared to wait. And be prepared to wait a long time!! We waited over an hour just to get on the cable car and then had to wait again to go up the tower. The cable car takes you up the steep hill to the base of the tower and then you need to take the elevator to the top. It is possible to walk to the base of the tower but it is quite a long steep walk. That may be preferable to waiting the 70 mins we waited for the cable car though  Views from the top are magnificent though. Make sure your going on a clear day as you'd be pretty annoyed to wait so long to get up to not see much,341,much
342,342,4146,"The N Seoul Tower was a serious touristy spot. The night we went was incredibly crowded - they had several busses of kids there touring the tower so our wait to even get up to the elevators was and hour or so long. Once we got to the top, the view was gorgeous. Seoul was a huge city! Our way down took almost just as long as it did to go up. There was a line that snaked around to wait for the two elevators to take us back to the cable car. You pay a few extra dollars, but it's worth it to take the cable car down to the ground floor. Overall, I'm not too much into crowded places so probably won't be back again. However, I am a believer of always trying things as least once!",342,much
343,343,4148,"I enjoyed all the different view with the different cities (how far away each city is). The gift shop has so much to offer. I mailed postcards from the Tower. It is expensive to eat at the Tower. The day we went to Tower was raining and overcast, which made it appear very smog. Would go again anytime!",343,much
344,344,4165,"If you've seen pictures of Seoul, chances are you've seen one with the N Seoul Tower. Korea doesn't have much in the way of architectural landmarks - at least, not as many as some other tourist hotspots - but this tower has always provided a focal point in the Seoul city skyline.  The surrounding area under the tower has a handful of souvenir stores, restaurants, and cafes while the tower itself provides some good eats married with good views of the city.  A meal at the N Seoul Tower at night proves to be a great activity... just remember to cross your fingers and hope that no fog nor smog ruin the views during your visit.",344,much
345,345,4170,"I went in the late morning, sun was behind the tower, could not take photo.  Nothing much to see except if you are keen in the couple lock.  Night view is much nicer",345,much
346,346,4171,"Not sure if it was just the day we got there but once up to the top, We couldn't see much as it was very smoggy. The ride to the top was one a minute. Small elevator but the line up was very short. It's interesting looking at the million of love locks.",346,much
347,347,4192,"Long queue up to Namsan Tower. Was advised that the best view is during sunset but missed it due to the long queue to the foothill of the tower.  Locals and tourists flock to this tourist spot for the love-locks which have become a lovers' haunt. Other than that, nothing much to do there.",347,much
348,348,4194,"Its a good experience though. I recommend hiking rather than riding the cable car on the way to the top. Its good theres show during 4pm onwards outside the vicinity. The observatory is so so. You can see the buildings, and thats it hehe.. Nothing much special but its worth an experience though.",348,much
349,349,4195,"We bought tickets to go to the observatory, glad we used a discount coupon. It's like we bought entrance tickets to a souvenir shop to be honest. A short elevator ride and an even shorter walk around the observatory. Nothing much to see or do there.  The vicinity is nice, interesting to see all the locks and the night view of Seoul but no need to go up the observatory. I find that it's a waste of time and money (even if it was relatively cheap using coupons).",349,much
350,350,4203,"We took the Namsan cable car to get here, that was quite an experience on its own. Had lunch straight away upon arrival at Best Burger in Seoul (yum!). Great facilities and friendly staff at N Seoul Tower made us feel comfortable. We took the lift up to observation deck, had our souvenir photo taken, and very much enjoyed the birds eye view from the top.",350,much
351,351,4216,"That is, if you've already visited other towers in the world much taller, newer viewing towers in other parts of the world. The copy cat Love Locks are a nice touch. And it does give a 360 degree view of Seoul skyline. There's a souvenir shop (not too pricy). And that's all there is to it. Go for it for a 'routine' part of the package tour.",351,much
352,352,4222,"I have been here twice and the second time I went up to the viewing deck. It was cool to see Seoul from that height. We took the local bus to get there, which is so much cheaper than the cable car, but we did get stuck in traffic which was annoying. I imagine that the view from the top at night would be spectacular, we went in the afternoon and spent some time figuring out what we could see from the top.",352,much
353,353,4225,"It seems like a mark of Seoul. When I went there in the daytime, not felt much special. There were some performances right outside the tower, seemed special.",353,much
354,354,4247,went here at night time. the attraction is recommended for visit. bring your own couple padlock here to save money :p. the ticket to go up is quite expensive and nothing much at the top. should consider to go up when you are in tight budget.,354,much
355,355,4248,"Buy a one way ticket up- the lines are long going up, and can be worse coming back down, but much easier to walk down (lots of steps) unless you don't mind spending the extra won and time waiting.",355,much
356,356,4249,I was pleased to send postcards from such place.  The tower itself is only ~200m and it costs 6000w to get to the top. Bit too much considering how hard it is to get there by foot or 8500w cost of round trip in a cable car. Not recommended.,356,much
357,357,4257,"Well if you are visiting Seoul, you can't miss this one...unfortunately nothing remarkable though...you do get a good view of the city but the tower is not really that tall...bit expensive but it's standard for tall towers to charge this much  Nothing great apart from a good view of the city...oh yeah and there is a men's urinal offering a unique view/positioning overlooking the city right 1 level below the observation deck",357,much
358,358,4258,"The view is great. You can see Han river, some landmark buildings, hills. You can see various districts of Seoul, skyscrapers next to Yeouido Park, but there is not much more in it. Anyway, it's definitely worth the visit for the view.",358,much
359,359,4266,"Very nice view overseeing the whole Seoul city from here. Just like Mandalay Hill, Myanmar, I admit that a bit more greener. Admission fees 9,000 Wan. A lot of people young couples and Korean family were her, not much tourist in August and weather please us and clear sky view.  What please me here, I see many lovers, couples, souvenir, Ice cream, sweets, coffee, a good panoramic view, you are not visiting Seoul, if your vacation planner omit this one, we had a good time with students from Myanmar. I miss our guide Ms. Jeinie!",359,much
360,360,4305,Such a notable landmark so you really do need to do this at least once. Many nice places for photo opportunities. Seen in many dramas the site where all of the locks from couples are. We went late at night and didn't have much of a wait time. Night view was beautiful though probably day time view would have been better to see all the detail sections of Seoul. But we weren't really wanting to go so bad that we would stand in line for 2 hours as some of the reviews stated. Late night we waited about 10 minutes.,360,much
361,361,4339,"We made the mistake of hiking up the hill to this tower, it was a nice but extremely steep walk up in killer humidity. There is a lift but we came at it from the wrong direction and never found it, so plan it out properly or you will be sorry like we were! The tower itself is nothing too special, the view is nice and the windows point you in the direction of other countries so that's kind of cool. You can send postcards from the top too. Don't feel too bad if you miss this. Other cities have much better towers.",361,much
362,362,4342,"Our group of 4 walked from Myeongdong to the cable car station at Namsan Hill. Took us 25minutes. The queue for the cable car was relatively short, about 10 minutes as it was a Tuesday evening. Once out of the cable car, you still need to walk up many steps to get to the Seoul tower. There are interesting spots for photography. You have to pay a fee to get up to the observation deck. The night view was lovely. The lighted bridges along the Han River were specially awesome. The quip was that we couldn't take photos as the light from the shop in the tower casted too much reflection on the glass. You can send a postcard back home from there as the shop sells stamps, cards and has a post box! Overall, it was a memorable and fun visit.",362,much
363,363,4349,"I feel like it's worth it. It IS expensive, though. I forget exactly how much, but around 20-30 won per person. But it's beautiful and if you can afford it, I would go.",363,much
364,364,4360,"I really don't get the appeal of this place...yes, sure, the view is nice from the top, but the cable cars were terribly full and so was the location...there were just too many people to really immerse yourself in the experience. The tower itself is simply a tower which lights up in different colours, it's no architectural masterpiece. If you plan on walking up to the tower be prepared for a very steep ascent with many steps, so bring plenty of water. It's quite a hike to the top, but great exercise. I'd much rather go to one of the city's amazing art exhibitions than see this overcrowded attraction.",364,much
365,365,4378,"Tower is pricier than we expected, and it was surprisingly poor visibility at the top. We thought views were equally as nice from Namsan park.  If you decide to go up,sunset is a beautiful it popular time - get there much earlier than you think is necessary, especially if by cable car ad the line backs up quickly.  Best to take the bus to the top, which runs frequently straight to the top since taxis can't go up. Bus stops running earlier though, so plan to walk or take cable car back down mountain if you'll be there later than 9.",365,much
366,366,4381,"I was there in September 2014, even though I haven't been to the top of the tower yet but the atmosphere surrounding the tower was fabulous.  My friend and I took a bus from the station, I forgot the name already, and left the bus at the N-tower station. It is an up-hill street which you have to walk till you reach the tower.  I did not enjoy the view that much but the atmosphere was impressive. Families, couples and friends were enjoying their moment together at the tower.  So, I just fall in love with the atmosphere not the tower itself. But such a good place to go indeed.",366,much
367,367,4389,"The Seoul Tower in Namsam park really does offer amazing views of the city. I didn't actually go up thought because you can get great views from the base, but Seoul was surprisingly a little smoggy.  The reason I don't give it a full 5 stars is because its very touristy, and there are much nicer places to get beautiful views of the city, of course they may require a bit of hiking, but I think its worth it.",367,much
368,368,4392,I went two time nothin the morning and the view is great although I think the night scene on the top of the hill if Nam San should be very good too. Both taking cable car and bus are convenient to coming up but I felt taking bus is better for elderly and not much slop needed for going up to station,368,much
369,369,4405,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much as there is so many of these views and towers around the world. A friend of mine took me there in the evening and after a while of waiting to get up, the most spectacular view I've ever had in my life appeared. Seoul is an incredible metropolis and the experience of seeing all those lights from the top felt almost incredible. I think I will have this picture in front of my eyes forever! :)",369,much
370,370,4410,"You must not visit at night time, otherwise you will not be able to see the view as the glass reflects the interior light. So please visit during the day for a greater experience.  But still it has a great view however I was not able to enjoy much because the windows reflect and there were a lot tourists in a small area.",370,much
371,371,4411,"I booked a tour to do this so the bus drove us up to a certain point and we walked the other half up. The hill is very steep. You will get a great workout. I do not recommend doing this when it is extremely warm in Korea as the humidity is very high and if you not accustomed to it could cause you great harm.  I was looking forward to seeing the N. Seoul Tower from the minute of booking my trip to Seoul. I booked a nite trip with Koridoor (we stopped at other locations as well as the N.Seoul Tower). The elevator ride up was great. I LOVED the view from up there however trying to take photos were hard because of the glare off the glass so that ruined it for me because I couldn't get the great shots that I wanted to get. If taking pictures really isn't at the top of your list then YES, it is a must see other than that go in the day time and the glares from the indoor lights may not affect your pictures as much as the night time views.  Before going up on the tower there is some areas to sit around and some shops to purchase food/snacks such as Coldstone. They also have the love lock area. You can purchase a lock from inside the gift store and put a lock on there. The view from there reminds of looking out over any city at night. It was great but nothing like looking at it from the Tower itself.",371,much
372,372,4414,Great night scene and worth checking out if you are in Seoul. Great view but depends on the level of clouds / smog how much you can see.,372,much
373,373,4415,I've been to seoul tower 4 times now and each time I love it more and more! The views from seoul tower are amazing! Every visitor we've had we take to seoul tower and they love it just as much as we do! This last time we went we did the love lock and it was so fun to lock our love in seoul! They have many great restaurants and souvenir shops up there as well!,373,much
374,374,4435,"Everyone said n Seoul tower is a must-go spot in Seoul. However, when I got there, I felt it was just okay, especially the view from the tower. It is true that I could see the whole city from the tower, but there is seriously nothing much to see. Probably that was because I didn't visit at the right time. And the visit was quite short because the tower is not big either. But the view under the tower is pretty cool. I love the scenery under the tower a lot. And you can breath the fresh air there.",374,much
375,375,4437,"Went during the spring, and was carrying high hopes (as many reviewers stated it is beautiful) that it may surprise me to capture its beauty. But was very disappointed, it was concealed and couldnt view much. We queued for more than 3hrs plus just to go up to the tower to find disappointments. (imo) not worth :)",375,much
376,376,4449,It was easy to go to the Tower. Food was available. And the view was grand. I am senior so I really didnt like much walking.,376,much
377,377,4452,"Checked out the Tower on June 24th, 2015. Very easy to access using one of the tour buses. Its about 1300 won or $1.25 USD. Although pic a day that is clear, when we stayed forecast was Haze everyday but we went regardless. Its obviously a great view being up so high, once at the top of the there are plenty of picture opportunities, there also decent pictures to be taken at the base of the tower. Also the guys washroom is great because the urinals have the most amazing view you've ever had while reliving yourself. We went on a weekday i think its slightly cheaper than the weekend but really our currency is valued much higher than theirs so most everything is relatively inexpensive. There is also a tram that can take you up and down, we decided to take it down and it was an ok view, 6000 won one way per person.",377,much
378,378,4454,"I went with my mum on a cold night. Fog was everywhere, but decided to take the risk and head up. Caught the cable car to the tower. Only a 15 minute walk from our hotel (Nine Tree in Myeongdong). We waited about an hour for the fog to dissappear, then paid to go up. Again, waited a while inside for the fog to go. Only a restaurant and a few coffee bars inside. Not much else to do inside other than the gift shop. Saw a review on TripAdvisor that said the best view was from the ladies toilets. Strange thing to say, but so true !! The view from outside was just as impressive. The amount of love padlocks there was overwhelming; (being a k-drama fan made being there even more special!). The view of Seoul was stunning, and worth the cold wait !",378,much
379,379,4464,"I've been here once before so I knew what to expect. But I didn't get that. Maybe their budget was cut, or maybe it was MERS to blame, but...  The exhibition, one of those live art deals where you can be a part of the art, was quite lame. I guess it was exactly as described but the atmosphere was empty and there's just not much excitement to have when you can really only do the pose they show you, nothing unique about your experience.  Then there's a SECOND hall, which looked totally devoid of people and I can see why. One is enough.  Going up to the observatory and you get the good views. I've been up enough buildings to know this is your bog standard deal. I actually found the 63 building view to be far superior, because you're closer to stuff for viewing, not up a mountain. the 63 building is in a place where you can see all the traffic and detail, and it's such an unpopular tourist attraction nowadays it takes no time and you get to see all round. So maybe check that out instead.  When I left, I expected the scheduled lights display on the Seoul Tower, which, when I was there a few years back came with music and 3d laser stuff and animations on the floor. This time, I got what seemed to be 3 minutes of silent advertisement on the tower, and nothing else. What an incredible disappointment. I was building up to that moment the whole time. I can only hope it was a one-off thing due to MERS.  Getting back down is hugely inconvenient since there are no taxis or buses, so you have to get this weird elevator down a side cliff, onto the road and walk 15 minutes or so to the subway. And there were no directions or instructions on how to do that; I had to ask a car park ticket officer.",379,much
380,380,4512,"Absolutely love this hike with the kids (4 & 6 yr olds). We started off at the crossroads by Hilton Millennium Hotel and hiked up the stairs. The kids enjoyed themselves and the scenary. My husband who is not fit at all, didn't soo much mind the hike as well. Granted the air quality wasn't so great that day but it was good quality time. I've jogged up the never ending road a few times for a good cardio workout but if you're looking for a good leisurely hike to enjoy with the family highly recommend it.  Getting to the actual tower is a disappointment. Once at the top we couldn't really see much past the US Army base at the foot of the hill because the pollution was bad. We weren't too happy about the condition of the tourist area...looks like the cleaning crew from the night didn't do anything as trash was all over the place. It seemed very dirty in the seated viewing area. We were there at 8am, so perhaps they only do cleaning later in the morning...but for a place that attracts a lot of tourists highly recommend they have it presentable all the time.  Would have given it high rating if it was cleaner. So i'm giving it only very good rating for only the actual hike.",380,much
381,381,4531,"If you like to have a view of Seoul in overall, you might like this place. Remember to check the weather forecast to avoid rainy day. There's love bridge alike section where people hang their locks on it for wish. My advise is, bring your own lock because it might be costly to purchase there. Go to the observatory tower only your travel budget allow because there's nothing much fun except that you can view the scenery in higher position. It is recommended to go there in the evening before the sun goes down, then you can view the scenery of Seoul in day and night time. However, it will be crowded there at that time because many people prefer that moment of time too.",381,much
382,382,4547,We went probably on the wrong day. Saturday evening there were far too many people. Buying the tickets took over 45 minutes and helpfully the lady at the counter told us that the trip to the tower would take another 90 minutes of waiting. And there are not much places to wait! About 2 hours later we were called to board the lift to the observation deck on the top floor. By this time it had started raining and the view was hindered by the water drops on the glass panes of the observatory. So not sure if it was worth the wait.,382,much
383,383,4563,"the view was just okay, so dont expect too much. I spend most of my time choosing and writing postcards n send to my friends. Plus point: You can post ur postcards just in the tower. So lovely!",383,much
384,384,4572,"Wow! This is a must to do adventure while visiting Seoul. I would recommend that you take the public transportation (bus) and plan about 4 hours (includes the bus trip) for your trip to the tower. It was definitely more interesting than I thought it would be to see how densely populated and the number of high rise apartment and office buildings make up Seoul and with almost every flat piece of land having a high rise on it. I am glad I arrived early in the day (9:45am) as many more people were arriving when I left. This is great way to get your bearings and understand the layout of Seoul. Also important for you to know that they take everyones picture before you step in the elevators and sell them to you at the top at the observation deck. The park like setting on the walk up the hill is very nice. I was also surprised to see the many love locks connected to the fences and other areas at this site. This was made popular by a Korean soap opera and considered very romantic thing to do...which I agree is.  Tips -go early -bring a camera -bring two locks; one for you and your loved one, to add to the many already there...very romantic -purchase the ticket with the popcorn/drink --best deal -plan to eat lunch in downtown Seoul as the food choices are much better",384,much
385,385,4576,"The weather was not so good and it was little cold BUT Seoul Tower is definately worth a visit. So much beauty up there, the view was great and we stopped by for a nice Long Island Ice tea and some burgers at the restaurants up on the mountain. Excellent attraction and well worth the visit",385,much
386,386,4579,"We didn't go up as it was very expensive and there was a set of stairs up a hill pretty much next to the tower which offered a very similar view for free. I would also say it is not the worth the trip to see just the tower, there are a few parks and recreational rooms (karoake, pc rooms, bars etc. ) nearby to make going to this part of Seoul worth it.",386,much
387,387,4596,I liked the visiting of the Tower very much. The way to it was spectacular. You can walk and relax. Once there you can enjoy the fontain which breezes you with almost invisible drops - lovely feeling. Than there is good choice of restaurants or bistros to eat. The tower itself is very difficult to observe if you are staying just underneath. And of course the funicular experience added a very nice atmosphere to that relaxed visit.,387,much
388,388,4602,"During most of my trip to Korea, the sky was very smoggy or overcast looking. So we didn't really have much choice of when we went. So all I can say is that on an overcast kinda day, I would just walk around the grounds and maybe do all the FREE things. Going all the way up to the top was nice, but we didn't really get a good view. After we got back down, we realized there was a place for us to walk up to (the deck with all the love locks) and that provided the same kinda of view from up top considering the condition of the sky. So we kinda regretted even paying.",388,much
389,389,4607,"Got lost trying to get here the first time (by bus) and gave up, but found it much easier the second time on the metro. The walk up is nice and the views are great if it's a clear day but no point with smog/haze. Worth a trip once to see it.",389,much
390,390,4608,"Walked to the top, but might want to take the cable car. the view is nice, and could be great but so much haze, distance you can see if very limited. I didn't bother going up the tower because of this (same view from there as the base given this). Several eateries at the base, and gift shop. As a couple, you can leave a love lock to in numerous areas as part of eternal love - a romantic thing to do. Would rate attraction much high had their not been so much smog. At night might be better? But if at day, pick a clear day (or windy so it blows the smog off).",390,much

The Tower it self is quite beautiful, yet there are much more romance per se, which you ought to find out, about the Locks hanging on the rails. Couple used to lock the lock together, then throwing the locks down the deck, immortalizing the love relationship for eternity, long while ago this activity was a famous attraction. Now, I think it's prohibited.  Inside the tower, there are some Museums you can totally check it out.",392,much
393,393,4629,"The weather was cloudy when we took a cable car ride up to the tower. The views were not as beautiful as I expected. We got there at the wrong time. If you want to enjoy the most beautiful views of Seoul, you should go to the tower when the sky is clear. There was a layer of dust on the glass. The view would have been much better if the glass was sparkling clean.  Would you like to leave a love message there? You could firstly buy a love message tile, write you message on it and stick it on the love message block. Some visitors even stuck photos on the tiles. There are clear instructions which teach you how to do it.",393,much
394,394,4649,"To be honest the climb isn't so special, I just prefer to walk up things if the option's there, but it's not difficult. Views from the top are great, but check the weather in advance - if it's rainy, foggy, smoggy etc. you won't see much.",394,much
395,395,4652,"This is one of the must see attractions in Seoul. I went in the afternoon but despite being a smoggy day, the views were spectacular. I decided to take a taxi to the CBD but walked to the tower, being an avid walker, and toured much of the surrounding area which also had some other fascinating attractions. Price was what you would expect and food was reasonable as well. I had a coffee at the top while taking in the great views of the city.",395,much
396,396,4655,"To save yourself some troubles...There are buses that travel up to Seoul Tower at Myeongdong Station. I made the mistake of taking a taxi and I am pretty sure that cabby screwed me over because I was a foreigner. Let's just say on our departure I had some choice words with the other cabbies that tried to charge a set fee of ‚Ç©20,000 but we found out that Myeongdong Station was literally down the hill from the Lift Cars by walking so duckies saved.  I suggest going at night because the view of Seoul is breath taking. It is amazing to see how much Seoul changed from my time as a kid in the '80s until now. I wish the Army would allow me to stay longer but unfortunately that is not an option.  Check out the Bear Museum inside. I know the kids will get a kick out of it and don't forget the skydeck. Been here once in the day and night so the block has been checked off.",396,much
397,397,4657,"The tower itself doesn't give me breathtaking view, it's quite normal view from the top. but still good for you who like to take a seat and take a high view over the city. What tick my curiosity is the ""Love Lock"" below the tower, many couple comes here to buy a lock, write your wish with your couple, and lock it together. It's like a lucky charm and simbolic of eternal love, Simlar to the one in the bridge where we can find in some of the places in the world. Well, not much to say, but still it's a great place to go when you have some spare time with your couple or family. :D",397,much

The good news is that for 6300 won, you can take the cable car to the top, almost.  If you choose the stairs, athletic or hiking shoes are suggested although I did see some Asian women climbing the stairs with 4 inch heels. I also saw one man in his upper 80's making the climb.  The pollution in Seoul isn't publicised as much as some other Asian venues but is worth considering, although some great views are available, a bad pollution day makes short range photography manageable but city view shots may be entirely obscured.  There are multiple restaurants, grab joints, beverages, trinket shops, and a view from the top of the tower available but it was too polluted when I visited to merit going up the tower and there are 360 degree views available from the plaza at the base of the tower.",398,much
399,399,4660,"Easy to go by Taxi or if you want to walk (A little steep hill to climb from MyeongDong Subway exit)  If you are travelling with elders or seniors, better just get a cab up the hill to the Cable Car place where you will pay a return trip for the cable car to bring you up to NSeoul Tower.  Great view on top of it, make sure the weather is clear. Yes it's very cold during winter.  You can have your Lunch or Dinner there, there's a Burger bar and some casual food court. Ice-cream place and an official Teddy Bear korea store.  The ticketing is easy, very straight forward and so far their english is ok and no problem buying tickets.  Once arrived to N Seoul Tower up the hill by cable car (Takes 5min or so, very quick and easy) Like in KDrama, lots of Padlocks with love messages which you wouldn't spend much time if you're solo or with your family. Vending machines for drinks and hot drinks.  There's an Alive Museum which you can when you go to Insadong or Insadong's Samzigil.  To conclude, It won't cost too much to pay a visit to this unique and must go place, yes it will not take you too long to come back down since there's nothing much to do unless you plan to have a good date there then it's perfect, chill and nice atmosphere.  If I'm not mistaken, the opening hours are till late 11pm.",399,much

Or that it was 11am in the morning. Whatever the reason, there was hardly anyone waiting for the cable car or the Namsan elevator. However, the cable car is overpriced, the entrance to the top of the tower is overpriced, the shops are overpriced. Nothing very interesting about this place. There's this whole lot of weird locks around the area and they sell cheapo locks at such horrendous prices I wonder why in the world would anyone buy them! I suggest going for a hike at Mt Bugkaksan and the view and fresh air there is so much more worth it than fighting to take pix with pushing and shoving rude nationals from you-know-where. Totally not worth the time, money and effort to go there",403,much
404,404,4727,We went to N Seoul tower in September at night. The area is very beautiful (the love locks and everything) but I don't recommend going up as it is so so to me. It's just another viewing deck. It's not very big as well. If you are into that kind of thing that it might be amazing to you. Tokyo Tower is much better. I'd say it's better to just stroll&sit around the area without going up. Very long line for the cable car but it's very quick.,404,much
405,405,4730,"I was told that it's better to visit the tower at night to view the night scenery and I wasn't disappointed. The Christmasy atmosphere was enhanced when it suddenly snowed. There was a steep climb on a slope and it was quite tiring for someone who does not exercise much. Reaching the top of the tower in an elevator within 26 seconds, there isn't much to do up there except view the night scene and visit the souvenir shop.",405,much
406,406,4749,"The tower can be planned as part of your visit if you have covered most of the places in Seoul since apart from the view from top there is nothing much. Since the top of the tower is closed with glass enclosure (unlike in say, Eiffel tower ) you feel a bit disconnected from the view.  To reach the tower you will have to walk around half KM from nearest bus stop and metro.  You can either walk all the way to the top, which can be bit taxing. Or take the option that I took, of taking cable car from mid way of the hill to the tower.  Do note that cable car entry may become crowded and will require you to wait for getting your turn.  Once in the tower complex you need to collect ticket for going to top of the tower in lift. View from is great, though you get a feeling that they have tried a bit to replicate Eiffel tower.  Best would be to visit in evening so that you can view the town before sun set and after dark.",406,much
407,407,4773,"Seoul N Tower has a great view of the old city center if the weather is clear like in Autumn. The tower is already located on a mountain. Hence, there's no need to go up to the top of the tower to see any better view since it is pretty much the same on the ground level. Lovers' lockers are crazy all around the safety barriers. It used to be more beautiful, but it became too much of it everywhere. Nothing much unless you are so romantic to add yours.  I personally recommend everyone to take a cable to go up because only cable cars, yellow public shuttles and climbing are possible. Private cars and cabs are not allowed in the mountain. When you go back to the city, I recommend to walk down as it is quite easy walk for about an hour and has a good view point on the way. Personally, I'd say night view seems way better than day one.",407,much
408,408,4778,"You can either hike or simply take the cable car up (8000 won per person). To avoid super long queue please go on a weekday which I did. Due to the cold season, the peak was a little foggy. The scenery will be much nicer if it is spring or summer. Don't forget to bring along marker and a padlock to lock your love messages. Though you can always purchase them at the sourvenirs shop but at an escalated price. We spent around 2hrs on top and really enjoyed the nice scenery and the fresh air. There are a few eateries and cafes so no worries about where to get drinks and food. I must say that this place is a must go when you're in Seoul. Furthermore after you're done, you can always make your way to Insadong (shopping for more sourvenirs and food) which is like 10 - 15mins walk.",408,much

The tower and observation deck are at the top of a hill in the middle of the city. You can climb the hill by car, using the stairs and enjoy the greenery. My favorite way: the cable car. At the top, you have many options: cafes, a museum, souvenir shops, a wall where couples put padlocks with their names or any promise, and much more. It is definitely a romantic place but has a lot to offer if you come with family or alone. There is a good restaurant up in the tower, serving French and international cuisine, that I personally recommend, the food is up to par and the views are great. It is an excellent and romantic option for a dinner with that special someone.",411,much
412,412,4827,"I had initially intended on taking a bus to the tower, however somehow I got lost and there was no obvious stop at the bottom of the road up to the tower. So I ended up hiking the 3km trail to the top in the middle of July - if you do this make sure you bring lots of water as it is both hot and humid!  The hike itself was really nice, and there were many different flowers and trees bordering the trail. Unfortunately, the view wasn't so spectacular since it was so humid and foggy the day that I went.  At the top, they definitely play up the love theme with heart flower arrangements, the chance to buy lover's locks (if you didn't bring your own) and attach it to the lock trees, and the benches are slanted inwards so that you sit closer to your loved one. I went to the restaurant on the main floor which was a bit pricey (also decided going up wasn't worth the $$ since you already can see out at the main level).  I think that other times during the year (Spring or Fall when it isn't so muggy) the view would be much nicer, or even at night when the tower is lit up. Regardless though, it still was an enjoyable attraction that CAN be free if you hike to the top and forego the extra lift to the top.",412,much

I am wary of city towers because of the crowds but N Seoul was not too busy when I got there and maybe better organized than many similar structures. The view was stunning, but I actually enjoyed the fun atmosphere with people taking selfies, just hanging out or ogling the famous love padlocks area below. It is a popular stop for most Seoul visitors with good reason. On a sunny day photos do come out very well. The food options here are not great but serviceable enough with burgers and fast food. The souvenir shops are nice and service efficient. The ride up Namsan was quite good. I appreciated the fact that Seoul is still pretty much a hilly kind of city, and you are never too far from nature and lots of greenery. N Seoul Tower and Namsan can be a pleasant change of pace from the furious shopping most do when visiting the city.",414,much
415,415,4848,"The Seoul Tower is located on the South Mountain, and supposedly you could command a spectacular view of the Seoul skyline. The reality, however; left much to be desired.  1. the line: there was a huge line to buy tickets, and to wait for the lift, and again to come back down the mountain, mostly by local tourists and chinese tourists who come as groups or individually. a wildly popular korean drama had some scenes here, so i suppose that's the main reason for the upsurge in popularity. i came here with my girlfriend late at night, around 9PM (the lifts close at ten), hoping to avoid the crowds, but still managed to wait for over an hour all together to go up and come down. We spent no more than 15 min on the top.  2. the prices were expensive, you pay for the cable car, as well as the elevator in the tower, which is only 200 something meters, furthermore, the Seoul skyline isn't all that attractive to be honest, don't get me wrong, i love the city's youthful energy and friendly people, its just that as a city, it is nowhere near NYC, HK, Shanghai, or Paris in terms of grandeur or overall aesthetic effect on the eye. For me, it was really just a bunch of high rises in the distance and tourists and souvenir stalls next to me. So unfortunately, I was left rather disappointed by the visit.",415,much

I faced about an hour's wait to go into the lift to bring the visitors up the observatory. I don't mind the wait, but there were not enough seats or rest areas for people who were waiting. Some, just made themselves comfortable on the floor. For me, i found an air con draft and stood at the same spot for almost 1 hour. Note: If you are coming by bus, there is a steep hill for you to conquer, so advisable to have comfortable walking shoes on.  (Wait is over.. or is it...) The lift ride simulated, somewhat like a rocket taking off, with effects and all. Frankly, I din enjoy it that much because we were all packed like sardines in the lift. SO instead of going ""wow.. look at the cool effects on the ceiling of the lift.."".. I was hoping the lift ride will end ASAP.  (View from the top) The view from the observatory was great. Crowds get into your face sometimes. Some will hog the glass panels and rest themselves at the panels / selfies etc. so STAY CALM.. and wait or walk around before coming back. They have the signs that will point in the direction of you hometown, stating the distance you are away from home. There is a mailbox at the souvenir shop. Apparently, it's the 'highest' postbox or something. Many people were trying to send postcards (purchased from the shop) back home to their loved ones. Do have a pen with you if you intend on doing so.  (Final comments) Interesting experience, but my wait and travel is much longer than the time i spend there. Nice scenery but I won't be going back if i return to Seoul.",416,much

Once up at the top, via a very speedy lift, we were treated to good views over Seoul. It was a clear day with no smog over the city. Unfortunately, the top is very busy a d many visitors smear their hands over the windows meaning you cannot really get good shots of the cityscape. Also, because of the huge footfall there are no comfy chairs to sit and relax up there.  The floor just below the top is less busy and for the men you can pee with a view. On this floor there is more information on the windows as to what you are looking at but again the windows are dirty. On this floor there is a coffee shop but the queue for the lift winds its way through the seating area.  We had good views but the huge number of people and dirty windows meant you couldn't really appreciate the cityscape as much as you would want. It costs 9,000 won per adult to visit. We walked up through the nature trails behind the tower. They are not clearly narked but if you just head in the direction of the tower you'll be fine. There were only a handful of people here.

The second I went was around Chuseok September 2012. A bit quieter since it was around the holidays, but they had traditional crafts and such. The third time I went was January 2013. It was freeezing, but there was so much to do! There was jump roping, traditional games, street artists, bands...it was amazing.  If you're in Seoul you have to come to N Seoul Tower.

I‚Äôd read about the locks in my guidebook but it simply described the sight as being ‚Äòtrees‚Äô covered with padlocks which symbolise eternal love. I knew to expect a few of these trees, but much to my surprise, I was greeted with an entire kaleidoscopic fence full of padlocks, key rings, phone cases, tags, hearts and toys - there was such an array of dazzling paraphernalia attached to the railings!  I spent nearly an hour taking in the sight before me, reading through the many names & notes appearing on the locks. Some of the messages were concise & to the point; others had a lifetime of thought & emotion put into them; all amounted to an astonishing display of collective happiness in the form of symbolic expression.  As for the view from the top of the tower? Well, it was pretty neat, but a little too smoggy to be considered spectacular.

Perhaps you can even fasten one to the fence yourself?",425,much
426,426,4928,"If you like hassle-free way to go to N Seoul Tower, you may take Seoul city tour bus (take the morning tour as I went on night tour too but the bus only stop there for bout 5 minutes?!) but it might take awhile before you arrive as this place is the 16th or 17th stop for the bus tour if I'm not mistaken. You may also take a bus or cable car to go there.  If you take a bus, you will have to walk uphill bout 10 minutes (depends). Other attractions nearby, such as Alive Museum and famous love-locks place are worth visiting if you have extra time to spend. You'll have to buy the ticket before proceeds to observation deck.  Basic costs: Heart love-lock set: KRW12000 (split two with my friend so KRW6000 each) Seoul morning tour bus: KRW10000 (you may hop in and off at most Seoul's attractions until 7 pm) Admission ticket for adult: approx. KRW15000 (observatory deck + Alive Museum) Sending postcard from observation deck: approx. KRW1000++ with stamp  It's such a nice place for photo sessions (despite it was really windy when we went there). The love-lock thing is so fun to do, and the view of Seoul from observation deck is just mesmerizing. I heard it is much fun at night, but I prefer morning as the view is clearer. Nothing to brag bout Alive Museum, just skip it if you dislike taking pictures. You need to come here if you're in Seoul, the air, the nature is amazing!",426,much
427,427,4934,"I lived in Korea for a year, and this is the most overrated touristy thing in the city. The view is nice, I admit, but you don't even need to go to the top of the tower for the view. The prices are also outrageous. This is to be expected, considering as how touristy it is, but it's not worth it.  You will pay about $9 per person just to go up the tower. Of course, you have to get to the tower first, which can vary in price and time, depending on if you take a bus, the (expensive) lift system or walk the whole way (not recommended unless you have a lot of time in Seoul). The food at the top is also expensive, so eat in advance, or bring snacks during your time at the tower.  I recommend taking a hike on one of the mountains in Seoul instead. It is a great way to get some exercise, spend some time with your friends or family, and the view is much better. Trust me. You will appreciate the scenery much more on the mountains. Bring a lunch, join the Korean locals, and make a day of it. You will not regret it.",427,much
428,428,4968,Tho it is a must to place to go if you are 1st timer to Seoul but sorry to say there is really nothing interesting there unless you wanna visit the art museum (no more teddy bear museum) which is the same as trickeye museum.  Unfortunately for me there isn't much scenery for me to see as it was too foggy also there were soo many people up there where you dont really have a chance to take a good picture plus the most important area which is the edge where u see the scenery is under renovation.,428,much
429,429,4972,"It's boring to visit. Not much to see during daytime, it's just a view from top looking at buildings and mountains around the tower. There were stalls in the tower selling souvenirs of the N-seoul tower. The food at the bottom of the tower was good though.",429,much
430,430,4973,"There's really not much to see in the daytime because of the foggy view. Also the observation deck is enclosed unlike Victoria peak in Hong Kong where you can idle around and enjoy the breeze and view. The price of the observation deck is not worth it. If you insist on going, you may want to take the bus (no. 05) instead of the cable car. It's much cheaper. Also, when you get there go straight to the ticket office downstairs. Don't bother with the combo packages.",430,much

We visited the tower in the evening on a Friday night so it was full of teenage couples searching for a romantic spot..so plan accordingly. We were fortunate to see Seoul during daylight on the way up and then stuck around until sundown to go back down - I would recommend doing the same but be prepared for a crowd. We walked from Myeong dong to the cable car office which was much more of a walk than we anticipated so I recommend cabbing it to save energy.,431,much

Truly, I think you gain just as much an idea of the expanse of Seoul from the observation at the base of the tower as you do from paying the 9000 Won to go up the tower. I find the tower crowded and more of a souvenir shop than anything else. Still, it is a fun visit, just wait for a clear day.",433,much

I did not eat in the restaurant, look elsewhere for reviews there. Twenty minutes is plenty at the top, the walk from the bus stop to the elevators is tough on bad legs, don't bother as it will only hurt you. If you are able to walk a couple of hundred yards up to the elevators, it is great! Spring or fall would be spectacular as Korea has so many beautiful trees! We were in the dead of winter and still enjoyed the view.",435,much
436,436,5006,"It's a tourist trap, but it's worth seeing at least once. I'd recommend going for the sunset, and it's probably most beautiful in autumn. The view of Seoul is quite incredible, you wouldn't believe form up there you can't even see the end of the city. I'd recommend walking through namsan Park if you can and are willing to (it's quite a bit of exercise). Otherwise just go there once, enjoy the view as much as you can, it's worthwhile one time. Cheers :)",436,much
437,437,5039,"Basically, there is nothing special about this place. But there is a Teddy Bear museum here and I think if you are not be able to visit Jeju Island for original Teddy Bear museum, this place is a great choice. I don't really recommend going up N Seoul Tower because there is a place which is much nicer than N Seoul Tower and it is 63 Building. Instead of N Seoul Tower, I think 63 Building has a much nicer view to see (especially night view). However, if you do have time, try to visit both places and compare it yourself.",437,much
438,438,5050,"Came here after our visit to Namsamgol Hanok Village. There were a few direct city bus from the village to Mt Namsan. From there, a manageable steep accent to the tower. I find the tickets way overpriced. There is nothing much on top and it was over-crowded and noisy. Apparently those who went up hang around (with the steep price, I can understand why) and it was hard to properly enjoy the view. I went there while the sun was setting and it was nice to see the sunset hues and then quickly turning dark (it was winter time). It was a good way to appreciate the city though ... Seoul is really huge...and the roads are all glittering with cars stuck in the jam :)",438,much
439,439,5052,"I've been to a few towers such as the one in Taipei. I think its different. Some people comment on the view but lets be honest here, the view is very subjective and also it depends on the city.  Anyway, the N Seoul Tower. I went both at night and day time. It really depends when you go. I took the cable car at night around 8pm, i didn't need to wait that long. I think maybe around 10~15mins time. The cable car is a bit pricey i thought but its an experience and most tourist will never know until they took it. Alternatively, you can take the bus there at a much lower cost.  I think one of the attractions was the safe/lock thing where many couples, friends and family (me included) purchased a lock and lock there. Of course some would say its not worth it and stuff like that but what I can tell you is that it really depends what your looking for. For me, i do it as an experience and memory so i think its worth it. Even if you don't purchase a lock and lock it there, its an experience to see how many people visited Seoul.  Overall, yes go and have a look and see what Seoul is from up high!",439,much
440,440,5055,"I cheated, took the cable car, which I do not recommend. The waiting time was about one and a half hours, way too much, you could have easily climbed it in the mean time. Up there at night a beautiful view over the hilly area, nice lights from the city, had a good view. Then took the stairs down, easy way, careful when wet or icy. many love locks on top, amazing to see.",440,much
441,441,5056,"The tower itself is not at the same level as others through the Asian region (we went to Shanghai Tower last week which was much better). Saying that still worth a visit, takes a few hours. Definitely take the return cable car (not much of a view, but avoids the walk). You do get charged for the cable car and then the tower entry seperate.  Whilst the tower was ok, would recommend the pancakes from the base level restaurant on the outer (and add a milkshake from the burger restaurant). Food was clearly the highlight of the trip!!!  Cable car view is not great, view from tower is good, albeit we had a fairly foggy day.  Would recommend allowing 2 hours for a visit, but wouldn't make it a prioirity on a 2 or 3 day visit.",441,much

Well, its not those small type of cable car that can be occupied by 4-6 people. Its those group type cable.  What's worst was the wat to the tower. We had to walk up and its pretty high so not good for o,d people (or oldsters as they term it). You can see the teddy bear museum inside. So if you're a teddybear lover, this is a must go. They got big size teddy bears in costumes a d small sizes that moves. They used teddy bears to show korean traditions like weddings and other feast.

My visit was during the winter which permitted much better views than are possible during the humidity of the spring and summer months. I would recommend visiting during the late afternoon. Sunsets over the city of Seoul are beautiful and Seoul light up at night is a sight not to miss. Keep in mind visiting the tower can be a bit spendy. There is a fee just to go up in the tower and all the food and souvenirs are overpriced.

457,457,5228,"Often in a new city, I do take the effort to visit towers or tall buildings with observation decks given my line of work. I don't often enjoy them given how most of these visits are often crammed full with tourists, usually over-priced, and due to the nature of having to move vertically - you have to endure packed elevators on top of the lines. Still, I do make the effort if I have the time and there are the occasional highlights - plus some cities really look so much better from up high.  The N Seoul Tower in Seoul, South Korea is definitely one of the pluses in my book. Although in terms of infrastructure there really isn't anything remarkably different about the N Seoul Tower, I definitely enjoyed my visit there and count it as among the highlights of my week long Seoul adventure.  One of the major attractions of the N Seoul Tower is its location atop the scenic Namsan mountain in the centre of the city. The tower is fringed by nature and the absence of cars gives the space a certain serenity that's marred only by the shuttle buses that ply the route up. It's definitely worthwhile making your way here just to enjoy the view from the base of the tower, soaking in nature's splendour and enjoying an ice cream from one of the many retailers here. I was here in Spring so the weather was crisp, cool and really almost perfect.  The N Seoul Tower has a unique positioning as the place for love with many love-smitten folks hanging padlocks declaring their everlasting bonds on structures and fences at the base. It makes for some pretty ornaments (albeit expensive ones) but really, this notion of public testaments of love seems pretty tacky. Plus the whole idea of a padlock reminds me more of a prison than love but hey, that's my opinion entirely.  The good thing about the 'love connection' here at the tower is that it lends the whole space a whole lot more charm and appeal. And the management of the place obviously knows this and uses this to their benefit well what with couple benches and love-themed souvenirs. Towers and tall buildings can be sterile and industrial so this lovey-dovey angle is really a compelling angle to have.  As compelling as the site is, the star of course is the tower itself. The N Seoul Tower has a few observatory levels including two restaurants. I only did the views so can't comment on the dining options up high. Tickets are not as pricy as some other towers starting at around RM24 (USD8) which is really pretty decent. There's a combo ticket option which gives you entry to the Teddy Bear Museum also located onsite which I highly recommend.  The tower visit itself is fairly generic. You have a fancy elevator ride up that's decked out with multimedia (this time on the elevator roof). The observatory levels offer great views and there are retail outlets too offering gifts and snacks. One nice addition is the opportunity to send a postcard overseas from the little 'postal office' there. I also liked how they indicated the distance to other major Asian cities on the glass windows based on the direction you are facing. I can see many tourists looking for 'home' and I did too.  So if you ever find yourself in Seoul, do check out the N Seoul Tower. If you do a relaxed visit with a meal, the Teddy Bear Museum and a walk around the site thrown in, it's a good half day at least. Check out the main website for access information and hours and I've heard that the night view is stunning. Definitely a site I will recommend.",457,much
458,458,5238,"I went there at night via cable car, which I recommend as the ascent can be quite fun, and you slowly get a wider and wider view of Seoul as you go up. It's good enough for you to stay at the base of the tower, and the open air environment feels nice at night. Nothing much to do though, aside from eating or looking at the view.  The top of the tower is a bit so-so. It's not that significantly higher imo. You don't get to feel the height either as there are no glass floors for you to look down. The buildings are indistinguishable at night so you can't identify the popular landmarks.",458,much
459,459,5241,"N Seoul Tower is a television located in Namsan Mountain therefore it actual height is much higher than 236m of the tower itself. N tower is a famous place for visitor as well as Korean people where you can view the whole Seoul city. I got there 2 times, One time in the morning and see many people doing exercise by climming up the mountain to the tower, in which many old people (amazing). It is also a good place for Korean athletics train their strength. Another time visit the place was in evening after wandering in MyongDong. The tower is beautiful at night. There are many beautiful Korean and Japanese couples get there to take pictures and lock their love in the lock tree. I've got one there, and so far it works. So dont fogert the lock if you have chance to visit this place.",459,much
460,460,5244,"Our first stop in Seoul. The cable car ride is recommended as you can see the whole of Seoul. The hike up to the tower was scenic as well. Since I came from USA and it was daytime (no lights), the tower itself did not amaze me. The teddy bear museum was fun for my 4yr old girl although there wasn't much activity to amuse me. The Korean culture as seen on the tower interested me. They have trees with padlocks and padlocks on the perimeters of the tower. What we enjoyed the most was when we were about to leave the area, there was a traditional costume wearing free of charge and my husband went for it. A good start for a whole day city tour!",460,much
461,461,5250,"You have to be extremely determined to get to the top of this tower. There‚Äôs no quick and easy way. A city tour bus stops here ‚Äì the hop on hop off type. Local buses venture up, and my guide book says that taxis carrying foreign tourists can drive up. There‚Äôs also a cable car but that‚Äôs no quick and easy trip either. The base of the cable car has no nearby metro and it‚Äôs a climb just to get there. On my way down I did see some shuttle buses but as a tourist, good look with finding out where they go to. There‚Äôs a rail car which covers part of the way from the base station to the street level.  Anyway, back to the tower. When you get off your bus, you‚Äôre still faced with a steep climb to the tower. Fatties beware. You buy your ticket then you look round for signs where to go and see none, so naturally you head to the base of the tower and inside you do a complete circuit past numerous cafes etc and see a lift. Then you‚Äôre told that this is not the lift up. The man points to a public phone across a pathway outside and a small alleyway behind it. You look for the signs and still see none. Not any in English anyway. The pathway leads you in to a building with various entertainments and you still find yourself looking around and having to ask where the lift is. Eventually, at some point in your life, you get to the top of the tower.  The view is ok. During my 9 day stay I went up on what was probably the clearest sunniest day and it was still very hazy. There were no distant views to be enjoyed. As always, I venture up these towers mid to late afternoon for daytime photos and stay until after dark for night shots. Seoul didn‚Äôt really come to life and light up very much. Not like say Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai and Sydney. It was disappointing. From a photographic point of view, the cleanliness of the windows was good.  Now the descent. I chose to use the cable car. By the time you‚Äôve walked down the multitude of steps to discover the huge queue, you‚Äôre unlikely to feel like climbing all the way back up to get a bus down. So you join the queue and during that time you‚Äôre expecting to come across a ticket booth, or pay on entry thing. Not quite. By the time you get to a point close to boarding you see that almost everybody has already got a ticket by some means, Your option is to exit the queue and buy a ticket form the vending machine at point of boarding. While you are trying to work out how to use the non-English machine, 50 people who were behind you are now in front and filling up that single slow-moving cable car. If you‚Äôre quick and lucky you just manage to get in that car as I did without having to wait 10 minutes for the next one.  At the base station it‚Äôs a case of wandering around and deciding on the options. You‚Äôre still fairly high up. There are steps down to street level, and as mentioned earlier, a rail car. Some of the non-English speaking tourists found a bay with shuttle buses, went to investigate, then returned to the rail car where I was, having been unable to find out which buses went where. Once you‚Äôre back on the street it‚Äôs about a 20 minute walk to a metro station. And you‚Äôre still going downhill.  So, as I said at the beginning, you have to be extremely determined to venture up this tower.",461,much
462,462,5261,"This is a must when visiting Seoul. There is a cable car which will take you to the top but can be very crowded. We walked the steep incline with our 3 grandsons ages 2,4,6. There could have got there much faster than we did. At the top we ate burgers which were wonderful as we sat over looking the beautiful city at night. On the way up we took many pictures thinking what a lovely city but by the time we made it to the top and ate, it was dark. My what a site! The light were worth the walk, very impressive. There was a small charge to ride up to the top of the tower but even if you choose not to do the tower it self the view is stunning from the base and the walking trail.

464,464,5270,"Missed this attraction fm my last trip so was very determined to go this round. We were misinformed at the concierge of our hotel that this place is walkable from the hotel!! I should have stucked to my own research findings and not trust the reception. Although a short walk, getting to the cable station was a sharp steep walk. Was totally out of breath when we reached the station! The best way to get there is by taxi as it won't cost a lot. It will save you a lot of leg power. If you really want to walk, we found out too late there is a much easier way. I don't have the road names ready but I will try to give adequate directions. From Myeondong shopping are, head towards Migliore dept store and turn right on the main road. Think is is called Namsan-dong. Walk towards Shinsaegae dept store (near Namdaemun market). Before reaching Shinsaegae, turn left (a big road so you can't miss it). Walk on for 5 minutes (uphill) and you will come to a lift (special lift just to bring passengers up to Namsan Cable car station. It is free and is so easy rather than walking uphill like what we did...at the cable car station, a return ticket is KRW8,000 per pax. Need a 10 min wait for each cable car to arrive. It was worth the wait as we got down at the foot of N-Seoul Tower. Plenty of activities as there were some shows going on, changing of guards? Can take pictures with the guards. After a few flight of steps, you will be at the big courtyard where you can buy tickets up to the observatory deck or go into the restaurants in the tower. We wondered around the open areas and were fascinated with the many colourful locks (for sweethearts) and couple seats...you need to see this and try it out...cool. The shops on the ground floor are so pretty and captivating that we forgot all about going up the observatory deck (KRW9,000 entrance fees) and shopped there for nearly 45 minutes, choosing all the cute stuff sold there. All in all, it was worth our while albeit the tough walk.",464,much

But you get a feel for the entire city from the above, which is quite special.  The height of the tower itself is actually much less than CN Tower. Much of the elevation comes from the mountain. There are some shops, cafes and restaurants near the tower entrance, but I would not recommend. When we went on top, Seoul was all white with snow, which was quite a sight.  After coming down from the tower, we headed to Grand Hyatt nearby (10 minutes by car), which had a very lively night scene with a fabulous lobby. I highly recommend going to the Grand Hyatt for a drink after you saw the tower.",468,much

That was a stroke of luck as we didn't know about the bus (not mentioned in the guidebook that we had).  As we arrive at the Tower in the late afternoon, we get to see Seoul in the day and after dinner, in the night, which was fantastic. For dinner, highly recommend the HanCook korean restaurant. Although it is a bit expensive, the buffet is relatively good and you get to enjoy the views without the tour groups and crowds (it is only one floor below the main observation deck). For even better deals, purchase the observatory/Hancook combo ticket. It provides some savings than if you pay separately.  Overall, a good place to view a panorama of Seoul city, though it will depend very much on the weather when you are there.",471,much
472,472,5354,"Getting to the Seoul Tower is something of an adventure in itself - I had no problem following the online directions to take the subway stop and walk through the commercial district past restaurants and things and take some stairs and walk along the street to the cable car, which was an interesting trip in itself. You can also get there by bus which would be preferable if you have a problem with heights.  Once the cable car lets you off, up on the mountain, you could walk over to the tower itself or you could explore the mountain, which has a big park and an outdoor pavilion area where they were doing some kind of cultural display when I was there, and who knows what else. There are also food vendors, coffee, and other stuff like that.  So far you could do all this for free, because you can just hike up the mountain if you want, and once there you don't have to pay for anything else unless you want to experience the observation decks or the restaurant in the tower itself. We decided to go ahead and pay to go up to the observation deck, because it doesn't really cost that much and it was a weekday so it wasn't very crowded. We didn't have to wait in line for anything, and we were able to easily take advantage of the bathrooms (which have amazing views and are very clean and nice) and the coffee shop and restaurant and so on that are on the observation levels. One thing we found out is that the restaurant is on a rotating level but the observation level does not rotate, so you can't just sit there and see the entire city like I thought I was going to do.  In summary, the views are amazing and definitely worth it even on a hazy day. Yes it can get a little touristy in there, and yes the prices at the coffee shop and so on are quite high, but it is a tourist attraction after all. I considered it to be worth the price of admission. I plan on going back on a clear day if possible to eat at the rotating restaurant just so I can enjoy the view of the whole city.",472,much
473,473,5358,Seoul Tower is a cool place to visit with your loved one. Make sure to bring a lock. It is a hike to reach the tower but worth it for a good city view. The admission is not too much. There is not much to do but good for a quick stop.,473,much

I took the bus both times, so I suppose I would try walking the foot path or cable car if i ever went again. The bus was fine. I recommend going in the late after noon when you can see the view of the city by day. You can then stay and enjoy a snack in the cafe and watch the sunset. You will be treated to an entirely different scene when you see the city light up for the evening. Go with someone who isn't in a rush, and who will appreciate the scenery with you. This is definitely worth doing once if you are in Korea for a year or more. Please be aware that there is an additional cost to go up to the viewing levels of the tower. Some friends had paid to take the cable car up to the tower grounds, but they then realized they had to by the additional cost to take the elevator up inside the tower. In my opinion, if you go all the way there, you have to go up inside the tower. The cost, whatever it was, did not seem much to me and was worth it. The lineups were not bad when I was there either, the staff was friendly, and the bathrooms were clean. Enjoy!",476,much

We arrived just before sunset, the day views were nice but slightly cloudy.  As day turned into night, the views were spectacular.  Before getting your ticket and going to the top of the tower (or after), get a drink or bite to eat or browse the shops and soak up the atmosphere on the lower ground section.  Lovely with the lights.  Such a great vibe.  Can get chilly so take a light throw.  Purchase a ticket and then head up.  Pretty quick.  When you get to the top, it is all enclosed but the night views were stunning.  There are seats if your lucky enough to get one plus a place where you can purchase drinks, sweets, souvenirs and other things.  Very busy.  Strangely there were a lot of children!  Clean.  There are toilets as well. Waiting for the lift to go back down took a bit longer but was still quick.  Nice.  I would have liked it to be less busier so you could really soak it up and enjoy the views but it was a weekend and I still enjoyed it.  Would recommend for sure.  Staff are not the friendliest!

After the bus drive headed to the tower, took the elevator up, collected our tickets and was informed that there was another 40min wait before we could take the elevator up to the observation deck. After the 40min wait you take the elevator up to a room with 360 projectors showing random animated movies on the walls, to distract you from the 30min addition waiting time here. When you finally reach the observation deck, you can barely see out the windows as the lights from all the souvenir shops there are reflecting in the glass. As a result of this the windows were full of finger prints and nose prints from people trying to see anything, and the windows weren't cleaned. After this disappointing experience we decided to head out again, only to find another 30min wait to get down! üôÑ  Summary of time waste: Bus 60min Entrance. 40min Entrance 2 30min Exit 20min  Spend your time on something else.",482,closed

485,6,1220,"Namsan Tower is accessible two ways. One is on a hilly road (my taxi went this way) and the other less slopping on foot (discovered this on the way down) and comes out opposite the Myeongdong Substation, near Prince Hotel. It would have been a nice night view but I went in the afternoon and still get to see the city below. As I hop into the cable car, I can't help but think of Lee Min Ho and Goo Hye Sun in Boys Over Flowers when they were trapped there overnight. All the surrounding trees were rather bare and not much flowers in sight at this time, perhaps later after the rain. In the main square there is cultural performance at 3.00pm and I was lucky to catch it. Very enjoyable. There's a small souvenir shop, a couple of coffee outlets, a hamburger place and a few eateries (but they appear to be closed). Many lovers and couples swear their dying love by clicking locks onto many of the railings (just like at the Great Wall in Beijing). I missed the revolving restaurant !",485,closed
486,7,1295,"I am awestruck by the view. Looking out over the city in all directions is simply amazing. A mix of large buildings, bridges, the river, the mountains and the green parks will leave you speechless.  Getting to the top offers a few options. First you need to get to the base of the tower. You can walk, take a bus or take the Namsan Cable car. We chose the cable car. Just past the Myongdeong station exit, near Namsan tunnel, you will find a set of stairs or an elevator to the cable car station. It was 8,500 won per adult and 6,500 per child. We were there at opening (0930) and were first in line. The car was packed when we went up but the views were spectacular.  Once at the base, there are multiple places to relax, eat and sight see. Bring a lock and lock it to the fence, it's a tradition. To get the the observation deck, you must pay. There are multiple options. Some include food, drinks and other events. We chose the popcorn and drink specials. 20,000 won for 2 tickets, 1 popcorn and 2 drinks. The popcorn was huge!  The ride to the top was fast. Once off the elevator the views were amazing. The observation deck is enclosed, clean and spacious. There is souvenirs and a resteraunt.  Overall we spent about 90,000 won to get from the city to the top for 2 adults and 3 small children. It was well worth it and we will never forget it.",486,closed

488,9,1422,I just visited the tower and I did not like it at all. The whole view is pretty but it took forever for us to get up to the tower. We arrived at the cable cart ride at 7pm and as it is summer there was still some light. There was a loooong queue to get on the cable. (Note no plural) thats right for a technological advance country that is hugely populated with both citizens and tourist the cable cart ride only has 1 (ONE) cable cart to take you up to the tower and another one back down it. The posters or pictures of the cable cart is so misleading. Theres only a total of 2 cable carts for a group of 20-25 sardines opps i mean people swashed in. Seriously what was Korea thinking when they designed it. So we queued to purchase tickets and then queued again for the cable cart. Once when we finally reached to the top it was 9pm. Thats right 9pm a whole 2 hours of queueing. Then we bloody had to queue again to purchase tickets to go up the tower which took another half an hour. We got our tickets at 9:30pm and was told that all the resturants were closed so no food was available. There goes our dinner. We had to eat in a cafe (A Twosome place cafe) muffins and scones. Not what we wanted especially since we wanted to eat at the dinner at the Ngrill. All other food shops were closing and only drinks were available. So we only purchased the observatory deck tickets which AGAIN we had to wait 50min to get on the elvator and up the tower. So just over 10 pm we were up the tower for only 20-30 min and only to queue again to go back down onto the cable cart. then we caught a taxi to take us back to our hotel for room service dinner at 12pm.  So all i can say that the N Seoul Tower was not worth the long queue and wait. Be prepared to wait as there is a long queue. We went on a Saturday night so I guess that makes the queue even longer.,488,closed

Watch out if the weather is bad you cannot see that much also on Sunday most offices are closed so the city is not as lit up with the buildings as during the week. Its considered to be a romantic spot so you will see a lot of locals having a romantic stroll around the tower. There are also a lot of restaurants around so you can have a diner and watch the city. Two ways getting there: a cable-cart ride which takes about 4-5 minutes or a walk up, which many locals prefer as its free and healthier rather then the cable-cart. Just after sunset on Sunday while I was there there was a sound and light show on the tower wall which was kind of fun.

Views from Namsan and the tower are even more stunning at night when Seoul lights up beneath you. However, you should be aware that the main viewing platform is closed off at around 10-11pm. The easiest way to get up to the tower is to take the Number 2 bus from Chungmuro station on line numbers 3 and 4.

I remember 3 years ago it was a relaxing walk up and down and also the tower area was quite peaceful. Somehow I have the feeling it is worsening year by year. The operator has started to renovate and offer now several floors with shops, restaurants and whatsoever. Some of them opened and just closed again. LOL. Why? Because probably not many people will spend a penny there. There are mainly interested in making selfies. That's it. And who shall buy all these things you really don't need? We went there and left every time at least 50k for tower entrance and a beer, coffee or ice cream. There were a few shops totally enough to serve visitors. And usually you climb up to have a nice few and not to drink and eat whole day long. Anyway this time is over for us spending any coin there. This year every time we visited the place it was totally over crowded. If you want to visit tower's upper floor you shall wait at least an hour or even more. Especially on the weekends. Same way down. I can be wrong but since 2015 it changed dramatically. We usually walking either up or down along the small road. I remember the time when we saw many people using the bike to go up. Time is over. Now every minute some old diesel engine is rushing uphill to unload and to come back to collect again. Some of them are driving fast and reckless. If you have kids you are mainly busy with watching them because you are afraid that something happened. I really wonder why Seoul citizens are not doing much about it. Did they gave up already? Do they like how it is? This place becomes really disgusting. It has nothing to do anymore with a nice, beautiful, quiet, green, park and place. It just became a polluted place of commerce.

Only a restaurant and a few coffee bars inside. Not much else to do inside other than the gift shop. Saw a review on TripAdvisor that said the best view was from the ladies toilets. Strange thing to say, but so true !! The view from outside was just as impressive. The amount of love padlocks there was overwhelming; (being a k-drama fan made being there even more special!).

The exhibition, one of those live art deals where you can be a part of the art, was quite lame. I guess it was exactly as described but the atmosphere was empty and there's just not much excitement to have when you can really only do the pose they show you, nothing unique about your experience.  Then there's a SECOND hall, which looked totally devoid of people and I can see why. One is enough.  Going up to the observatory and you get the good views. I've been up enough buildings to know this is your bog standard deal. I actually found the 63 building view to be far superior, because you're closer to stuff for viewing, not up a mountain. the 63 building is in a place where you can see all the traffic and detail, and it's such an unpopular tourist attraction nowadays it takes no time and you get to see all round. So maybe check that out instead.  When I left, I expected the scheduled lights display on the Seoul Tower, which, when I was there a few years back came with music and 3d laser stuff and animations on the floor. This time, I got what seemed to be 3 minutes of silent advertisement on the tower, and nothing else. What an incredible disappointment. I was building up to that moment the whole time. I can only hope it was a one-off thing due to MERS.  Getting back down is hugely inconvenient since there are no taxis or buses, so you have to get this weird elevator down a side cliff, onto the road and walk 15 minutes or so to the subway. And there were no directions or instructions on how to do that; I had to ask a car park ticket officer.",583,else

589,66,4839,"Yes, this is a definite ""tourist site""; but those who enjoy going off the beaten path, don't let that deter you from enjoying the absolutely breathtaking and first-class views that can be enjoyed at the tower! Also, take note: whether it's called ""North Seoul Tower"", ""Seoul Tower"", or ""Namsan Tower"", it's all the same place!  My husband and I took a subway to Myeong-Dong; then, we walked (mind you, it's ALL uphill, so strollers, crutches, and wheelchairs will be a challenge! and once you get TO the mountain, they will be impossible, sadly) to the sky-lift that takes you (in groups of about 20 or so) to the middle of the mountain below the tower. Be sure to purchase the round-trip tickets for the sky-lift; or else you will be forced to walk alllllll the way down the massive staircase from the top to get back down.  (Sidenote: this is considered a very romantic, ""couples"" location; so, my husband and I were able to get a couples' ticket deal on the sky-lift. If you're in pairs of two, this is the way to go, because it saved some cash for sure.)  Once you arrive on the mountain, you will need to take the rest of the stairs to the top of the mountain where the tower sits. There are a LOT of stairs! Children will probably tire and need to be carried. The good news is that there are several platform areas with food and refreshments available for purchase. We saw beer, water, soda, juices, and all sorts of snack foods being offered to weary wanderers as they trek up the stairs to the top.  There are several areas all around the tower where you can take the most spectacular pictures and enjoy the amazing view of the city. It's 360 degrees all the way around; so, you can get nearly any angle of Seoul you wish. If you get vertigo, beware! Lots of opportunity to get dizzy. :-( But, it's truly worth it. I really believe you will not find better views of the city than right here at N. Seoul Tower. Also, it's worth noting that we went during the afternoon; but we've heard it's absolutely incredible at night with all the lights in the city sparkling around you.  If you're with your sweetheart bring a lock with your names and a special date on it to ""lock in love"" on the tower railing. There is a similar place like this in Paris (a love bridge), but I think the view here at Namsan far outweighs the bridge in Paris. Forgot a lock? No worries, they're sold right there on site (mind you, they are a lot more expensive at the tower!)!  There are several ""love benches"" (shaped in a ""V"" that forces the two sitting upon it to squeeze in close together), ""love lock trees"" (yes, trees made entirely of love locks), and other ""love"" related things that make for great photo ops.  There's a restaurant at the top of the tower, one at the bottom, and several, little shops and snack shops surrounding the tower too. We did not eat there, but everything smelled delicious!  We really lucked out the afternoon that we visited, because they were putting on a traditional, Korean martial arts display on the big open area near the tower. It was a FABULOUS performance, and afterwards they allowed the viewers to come down and touch and hold the weapons and such.  I cannot imagine traveling to Seoul (especially for the first time) without a visit to N. Seoul Tower! There's a reason all the tourists go there - it's incredible and there is absolutely NO better way to view Seoul in all it's splendor than from the vistas of the tower itself.

You can also get there by bus which would be preferable if you have a problem with heights.  Once the cable car lets you off, up on the mountain, you could walk over to the tower itself or you could explore the mountain, which has a big park and an outdoor pavilion area where they were doing some kind of cultural display when I was there, and who knows what else. There are also food vendors, coffee, and other stuff like that.  So far you could do all this for free, because you can just hike up the mountain if you want, and once there you don't have to pay for anything else unless you want to experience the observation decks or the restaurant in the tower itself. We decided to go ahead and pay to go up to the observation deck, because it doesn't really cost that much and it was a weekday so it wasn't very crowded. We didn't have to wait in line for anything, and we were able to easily take advantage of the bathrooms (which have amazing views and are very clean and nice) and the coffee shop and restaurant and so on that are on the observation levels. One thing we found out is that the restaurant is on a rotating level but the observation level does not rotate, so you can't just sit there and see the entire city like I thought I was going to do.  In summary, the views are amazing and definitely worth it even on a hazy day. Yes it can get a little touristy in there, and yes the prices at the coffee shop and so on are quite high, but it is a tourist attraction after all. I considered it to be worth the price of admission. I plan on going back on a clear day if possible to eat at the rotating restaurant just so I can enjoy the view of the whole city.",597,else

We spent quite a good amount of time posing and photographing each other in front of the sculptures. After that we reached the observatory. It was almost the time of sunset.

634,36,3815,"We visited N Seoul Tower on a Sunday and it is one of the worst decision ever. Walking up to the cable car is simple and straight forward from Myeong Dong. When we arrived at the cable car terminal, we were informed that the waiting time would be about 40 to 60 mins. There were many Koreans and Tourists waiting to head up to the tower.  The day we were there, visibility was low. We still decided to head up to the observatory deck and was disappointed as we were unable to see the scenary clearly. The deck is also small and packed with people. Not sure if it's worth the money to head up. Neverthless it's definitely one of the to do attractions in Seoul.",634,disappointed
635,37,3845,"I've been wanting to come here ever since I first saw that cable car scene from My Lovely Sam Soon and was not disappointed! We planned to arrive during sunset and the hotel I was staying is pretty nearby, so we decided to walk on over. The walk up to the cable car station wasn't bad at all, probably because there is this elevator/ramp hybrid thing that helps you up this last steep portion. The cable cars were really cool to ride in although they do kind of pack you in since there are a lot of people.  Once you get to the top you have to climb a few more flights of stairs, which isn't bad, but may be for those with mobility issues. Once you get close to the top you can start to see all the locks of love. There were quite a few vendors selling locks so those looking to lock their love last minute don't have to worry. The view below the tower is really gorgeous although it was a bit windy when we went. There are quite a few restaurants/shops around the bottom of the tower for those who are hungry from the climb.  The tower costs an additional extra to go up to and we bought the package deal in which popcorn/drinks are included. It's funny how they play this scene that you're blasting off to space as you ascend in the elevator. Once you get to the top of the tower, it's pretty much a 360 degree view of Seoul with souvenir shops in the middle. I like how on each window it tells you how far you are from a major city in the world and it's nice to sit down and chill next to a pretty view .  There's not a wholeee lot to do here besides admiring the scenery, but the entire experience was definitely worth it and fun!",635,disappointed
636,38,3941,"We visited Seoul Tower on the day of ""chuseok"" (major harvest festival) 2015. We did not plan but the day was 27th October (supermoon). We reached there by bus from Chungmuro station. The bus was over crowded. We reached and saw a big croud towards Seoul Tower. ( It remind me of Durga Puja in my hometown Kolkata). I was a bit disappointed. Then we reached the tower by walking. ( I want to visit again by cable car or by hiking through Namsin Tower).  It was a huge queue in front of the ticket counter. anyhow we took a ticket for Alive museum and the tower observatory. We entered the alive museum and our mood changed totally. The alive museum might look childish to most of us (I also thought in the beginning). But I bet everyone will enjoy this museum. After that we reached the observatory.  I was almost the time of sunset. We saw the entire city. It looked amazing. We stayed there for almost one and half hours and enjoyed the scenes outside. The city of Seoul at night with supermoon is a lifetime experience to me. The traffic on the both sides of Han river looks like golden necklace.  Its worth visiting Seoul tower at night. But I will try to visit Seoul Tower in a weekday when there will be a little crowd.",636,disappointed

I think there's a bus that goes up there, though.  There were many, many people there, and they pack you in like sardines on the cable car that goes up to the tower, but once you're there, you have the chance to spread out a bit. The views are absolutely worth the trip.  If you can time the trip with sunset, you will not be disappointed. We got to see the sun set over the city, and then took pictures with the city lights coming on. Just beautiful.",637,disappointed

641,43,4466,"While the Seoul Tower in its ever changing colored lights, looks beautiful and intriguing from afar, I was disappointed when actually standing on the 777 foot structure. Perhaps it was the timing of the season and or day but I felt it was a flop at the top. We decided to hike up the winding road full with the beauty of nature. Upon reaching where the buses park for transport up and down the mountain there is a small convenient store and restrooms before you enter into the attraction. Another steep pavement hike and we had arrived. Ice cream and other food vendors were plentiful along with a gift shop. There were several locks of love art projects structured like Christmas trees on one side and a stage on the other. Unfortunately there were no acts during this time period. There is an observatory higher up with a view that would not disappoint on a clear day. I don‚Äôt know if it was the smog of pollution fogging up the view the day I visited or the clouds. At best though, even through the smog you can see the outlines of buildings for what seems like forever in the grand city of Seoul.",641,disappointed

643,45,4561,"In Seoul, our tour group visited the N Seoul Tower which is Korea‚Äôs transmission tower for television and radio broadcasts. It was raining that day and was crowded with holiday makers as it was the peak season in spring. We were quite disappointed as we cannot take many photographs of the scenery surrounding the Seoul Tower due to the rain and crowds. Our group followed our tour guide who took us to the tower by walking uphill. Even though we are fit, It was quite difficult to walk uphill especially in the rain and some parts up the hill are steep. We took the elevator to the tower‚Äôs Digital Observatory and spend less than an hour there as the place was getting crowded. We could see the city of Seoul and Mt. Namsam but some parts of the scenery foggy due to the rain. There‚Äôs a souvenir and snack shop at the observatory deck and my spouse bought a mini N Seoul Tower as a memento of our trip here. Prices at the souvenir shop are quite expensive! At one part of the tower, there are thousands of golden locks ‚ÄúLocks of Love‚Äù which are attached to the fences. It seems this is a recent attraction for courting couples to declare their undying affection at this place. Nothing special about this tower, as we have visited some nicer ones - Taipei's 101 and Shanghai's Oriental Pearl Tower!",643,disappointed

The souvenir store is so brightly lit that you can only see out the window if you cup your hands around your face, and that's if you can get past all the greasy smudges from everyone who has already been there before you. My sister & I were extremely disappointed.",645,disappointed

648,50,4848,"The Seoul Tower is located on the South Mountain, and supposedly you could command a spectacular view of the Seoul skyline. The reality, however; left much to be desired.  1. the line: there was a huge line to buy tickets, and to wait for the lift, and again to come back down the mountain, mostly by local tourists and chinese tourists who come as groups or individually. a wildly popular korean drama had some scenes here, so i suppose that's the main reason for the upsurge in popularity. i came here with my girlfriend late at night, around 9PM (the lifts close at ten), hoping to avoid the crowds, but still managed to wait for over an hour all together to go up and come down. We spent no more than 15 min on the top.  2. the prices were expensive, you pay for the cable car, as well as the elevator in the tower, which is only 200 something meters, furthermore, the Seoul skyline isn't all that attractive to be honest, don't get me wrong, i love the city's youthful energy and friendly people, its just that as a city, it is nowhere near NYC, HK, Shanghai, or Paris in terms of grandeur or overall aesthetic effect on the eye. For me, it was really just a bunch of high rises in the distance and tourists and souvenir stalls next to me. So unfortunately, I was left rather disappointed by the visit.",648,disappointed
649,51,4987,"I do love a sky tower, but this experience wasn't the best. From a distance, N Seoul Tower stands tall and chic. Our experience was far from chic. Queued for about 1.5 hours before even making the cable car flight, in a waiting room crammed full of tourists, and little ventilation. The room was filthy, with people dropping their trash all over the place, and no-one cleaning it up. Not ideal, but we dealt.  When we eventually made it to the tower foyer and the top of the hill, we were presented with a further wait whilst we waited our turn to ascend the tower itself.  After our expedition to the top, we were quite disappointed. The windows were really dirty, which made photographs, and the general view, pretty poor. There were no outside viewing areas, and they really pile the punters into this tower, so there's very little room for manoeuvre. There's also a pick'n'mix candy store which is just absolutely ridiculous.  Probably worth a visit if you're in the area, but you should try to go early in the day to avoid the crazy queues.",649,disappointed
650,52,5009,"So an earlier review said this was better for couples and most reviews were positive but having gone based on these reviews I felt disappointed at the end. The area is clean and the views are nice, and we certainly enjoyed the long walk their from our hotel. Inside however, you are hit by the 'candy sweet' smell of popcorn while queueing for your ticket. Their are different options available, and since we were there at lunch we opted for the 'couples package' which included trips to the viewing deck (for two people, despite the board saying one person only) and lunch in their 'Italian' restaurant. Once inside the lift you are told to look up where, on the lift ceiling, they play a techno high speed video that you can't focus on and if anything made us both feel weird as the elevator was ascending. Then once inside the place is full of 'pick and mix' sweets and crap for kids. How someone has suggested that the attraction was suited to couples is beyond me. The restaurant was the biggest let down. We were greeted and seated in an awful spot with a huge vent blocking the view (the restaurant was 99% empty at the time). Then, with virtually no English (unlike most people we met in Korea who speak quite good English) we were offered only two pasta plates, carbonara or arrabiato, neither of which we wanted. This was also to share - NOT a plate each! This hugely limited choice, given such a varied menu, was never indicated at the ticket office. It also did not include any drinks which, you guessed it, cost the earth compared to normal places. The food when it arrived was then totally different. We had a smoked salmon salad which may have been nice be it for the gallon of dressing covering everything - the pasta was well cooked but ruined by streaky bacon, and also a margarita pizza was served but the base was literally thinner than a crepe!  The views from the base surrounding the tower are just as good as inside. I would recommend the walk and to visit the various viewing points... The tower its self is very average and i certainly would not be conned into a meal package as conned is how we felt.",650,disappointed

But at least the Teddy Bear Museum was quite a good experience.",651,disappointed
652,54,5168,"We bought the tickets to go up the tower, but once we were up there we felt kind of disappointed. Because the air conditioning was not turned on and it was summer, hence it was hot and stuffy, so we didn't stay long in the tower. So I recommend that it is not a must-do to pay quite an expensive fee to go up the tower.  However, the ground level view is good enough to get an aerial bird's eye view of the city. The air is fresh because of all the greenery and we wished we had brought food to do a picnic in the namsan park. This offers a good break from the hustle and bustle of city life, but beware of the touristy crowds that tend to flood the place.",652,disappointed

From there, it was an uphill walk towards the tower. Up at the plaza area, we could still enjoy some good views of the city below us. The weather wasn't perfect, but we still went up to the Seoul Tower for a higher view. We took the elevator up and were taken by surprise with the motion-graphics display inside the lift. It made us feel like astronauts traveling in a space shuttle into the galaxy. At the observatory, we were disappointed with the 360‚Å∞ view due to the fog. The view up there in an enclosed observatory was actually worst than the open view down below at the plaza. The only worthwhile thing to mention about the observatory is the restroom. Try to visit it even if you don't need to use it - you'll be amazed.",653,disappointed

Now, the Nanshan Tower locked wall is a very popular tourist attraction. At Nanshan Tower, the highlight is that there are interpreters for multiple languages so that you do not have to worry about language barriers.

The ride was smooth, but the view from the car and from the tower is nothing special. We went there in the night expecting nice views, but there is too much light which prevents us from getting a good view of the city (see picture).

By all means, go and have a look but ensure the sky's clear because you'd only go up there for the views, the tower itself and immediate surrounding areas are a little underwhelming, and that includes the Hello Kitty Island experience which I can only recommend if you are a die-hard Hello Kitty fan. Even for the likes of us, who find Hello Kitty quite cute, it was not worth our time.",679,much
680,24,488,"So we recently visited the tower and I thought I might write down how we went about it and some suggestions. --------------------------------- When to go:  So we visited in early August and found that the best time to to go was the evening (of course this will depend on weather and month etc) . I would suggest you arrive at the tower by 7.00pm and be on the viewing platform by 7.30pm, as by 8.00pm it will be dark. This will allow you to view Seoul during the golden hour, sunset and night (when the whole city lights up). This will probably be one of the more busier times though, so beware. If you want a less busy experience maybe go early morning or around lunch and be don't visit on a weekend but a weekday. ---------------------------- How to get there:  We were staying in myengdong area which conveniently had a bus that takes about 15 mins to go directly to the entrance of Seoul tower. It comes every 15 mins and costs around 1,200 won without a tcard and 1,100 with. For those staying in myengdong the bus stop is to the right of myengdong Station entrance 2. The bus you will need to catch is the no. 5. Those staying in chongmyeong can catch either the no. 2 or 5. There are other methods of getting there. You could taxi or get the train to the bottom of the park and get the cable car up.  I would suggest that if you want to walk the hill/ Park area to get to the tower, that you should walk down instead of up. It is a step climb up, with quite alot of stairs and steep slopes. It would take you a good 30 mins plus to get to the top and you will be tired. ----------------------- Seoul tower Park:  So beneath Seoul tower is a sort of park area with a few viewing platforms, one of which is covered in love locks. I would recommend getting some of your photos group photos here. Its a little less busy and the view is almost as good. Beneath the tower there are many places to eat and shops. --------------------------- Seoul tower  The tickets can be bought online and at the tower. We bought at the tower and don't encounyer much of a queue. Tickets cost 10,000 won per adult and 8000 won for children and seniors. They are open tickets which mean there are no time slots allocated. You can enter the tower when you please and stay as long as you like.  There is one main viewing platform and it will be busy but the views are stunning. If you find yourself needing to get away from the hubub I would suggest you go down to the next level (sub viewing platform) and go to the toilet. Each has its own private view and the facilities are very nice.  I saw quite places to eat on each level with lots of different choices e.g Italian, Korean,  Chinese etc. I don't, however, know how much it costs. ------------------- Getting down:  When finished there are multiple ways to get down. The bus which you took to go up, the cable car and the walk. The cable car costs 7000 per adult and takes about 10-15 mins to get down to the bottom where it will drop you off near myengodon, where you can get to myengdong Station or just walk home.  However, if you are feeling up to it I would suggest walking down.  The path is well light, nicely paved with great views all the way down. It has a great view of the tower and its a nice stroll through the park area. The path is just left of the cable car when facing down the hill. I think it took us about 20 mins to get down. You will just about the reach the same area that the cable car will drop you off at. From there its a 10-15 min walk back to myengdong main street. --------------------- Worth it?  I believe so but I am a sucker for a good view and a relative payed for most of the trip. I can see how it may fall flat for many as it is very busy tourist hot spot which is arguably overpriced. I believe families should see this is as one of their big nights out. I still think those on a budget should go but maybe limit there spending by walking and taking snacks up with them to eat in the park. While Seoul tower is arguably the most iconic, there are still other platforms you can choose from. Also, if you were just viewing during the day and wanted a challenge then instead of observation decks go to some of the mountains that surround the city. We went to bukhansan (1/2 day quite hard hiking) which has amazing views.  Hope this helps people out. Sorry its so long, thought the detail would be good. --------- Protip: For those who do go in the evening (who are treating this like one of their big nights out) and finish the tower looking for dinner I would suggest going to woori Garden korean bbq in myengdong. Amazing stuff.",680,much

We just need to take the physical entrance slip at the kiosks with the mobile confirmation.  There are some shops and restaurants/eateries at the Tower.  It's a popular place and must visit.

The cost doesn‚Äôt get you to the top which I do find disappointing. You have to pay an additional cost of 11,200 at the half way point to go the all the way in an elevator to the ‚Äútop‚Äù. 3of our party did and 3 stayed behind. They enjoyed their extra trip which had an exhibition at the top. The cable cars were larger on the return journey which I found very reassuring.

Very popular place with tourist and local, we took cable car up there , cost ¬•9500 @ for return , not a very long ride, but a walk to the escalator before you reach the cable car station. Too much for elderly. Better take a bus to cable car station . alternatively you can take a circle line bus from the closest subway station cost about ¬•1250 @ way to the tower and no cable car . You may order the entry ticket online and get ¬•6000 which most people do. Try out some websites. The view is authentic especially the night view but the viewing deck is relatively congested. The snack bar lighting is too bright so the reflection blocked your view . Seoul is large city but not as many high raise than inHong Kong. So the night view appears less impressive than in HK.

I went in the morning and walked, instead of using the cable car. Surprisingly, there were many facilities that offer food and drinks, including draft beer. Based on my experience, I would suggest to go late afternoon to have a dinner, see the panorama in daylight and after dark, and enjoy glass of beer. I usually walk a lot, however walking to the tower was too much exercise and I had sore muscles even three days after. So some people should consider cable car.",693,much

You head down some steps into a concourse area where you can buy drinks and trinkets. I purchased my ticket for the observatory and waited in line for the elevator to the observation area.  Essentially I paid 10,000 krw to ride a lift and look out of windows covered in the handprints and faceprints of small children, all the while getting barged out of the way by impatient tourists.  Personally, not worth the money. Catch the cable car or walk up the steps to get nice panoramic views. Don't bother with the observation decks...

There are several restaurants should you feel hungry and want to eat. There is a convenience store for your basic needs. If you are travelling with very small children and elderly, it may be a challenge walking up the steep hill leading to the tower. There is a portion there where there are trees where you can attach your lock as a remembrance until the next time you visit the tower. The best way to reach the top is by car, if not, bus. Taxi's are not allowed so it's a longer walk by cab. If you go up there during the colder months of the year, bring a jacket, the cold is felt very much at that height.",695,much

Well,maybe it would have been different if we went up the other way with the cable car but we went up there as past of a half-day tour. First of all, you can't get up to the tower area itself without walking up or taking a city bus or being part of a tour. No cars are allowed. That part was okay as we did go up by bus. What was disappointing was that it seemed very commercialized. There was a fee to go to the top of the tower. That was understandable but then.they take a photo of you when you enter which of course comes with a price tag. And it was extra to go into the Hello Kitty area which seemed like a promo store??? We didn't go in. Don't get me wrong, the view was nice from the top and outside where you have the love locks and park area. I guess I'm just a bit jaded because of my disappointment. Maybe it would have been nicer to go in the evening with all the lights. But to me-you do it once...",697,much

It was quite a hike from Myeongdong to the cable car station to bring us up the tower (I forgot how much but around 9000 won roundtrip), but it‚Äôs manageable. After getting off the cable car, you can already see colorful ‚Äúlove locks‚Äù all over; you can place your own. (If you don‚Äôt have a lock they sell it there.) You can also take photos of the Tower from that area. Then there is an option to pay to get up the N tower itself. Since we didn‚Äôt want to eat another buffet meal, we only got the tickets with pizza and pasta meal for 2 (not at the top of the tower though), but the pizza especially was superb. At the tower itself, we didn‚Äôt need to stay long; 15-20 minutes was more than enough. It was fun to play the interactive booth game though, where you can say hi to people at the Busan tower. :)",699,much

Our trip here could have been replaced by another place but what the heck; a check mark for you now that we've seen it.  Note the treetops with LARGE bird nests and the walk path that abound with beautiful flowers including tulips  There are many stalls at the top selling assorted merchandise - all pricey :)",700,much

We're reached the tower towards sunset to see the sun goes down on the city, but as the visibility was very poor due to the temperature and the atmosphere, we decided to check the tower itself. There is a deal for two at 22K W for two tickets + 2 drinks and 2 popcorn's (heavily stuffed with butter), and upon entering it looked very strange to the team there that we (as two tourists) didn't want to get ourselves pictured for an overpriced photo set (1 for 15K W and it goes on...)  Once we reached up we discovered that it is almost impossible to get a clear sight in the night because of the merchandise and internal lights that these boots are reflecting. All the surrounding windows had reflection of everything you see inside (people shopping, lights of candy stores etc.) and you could not take a decent photo with those reflections. I guess during the day it is much better, but trying to compare the pictures shown by the staff of Seoul at night makes you wonder where was it taken (on the roof top of from a different building :))....",701,much

I decided not to walk up the path because I have a bad knee and climbing that many stairs would have hurt. I bought a one way ticket for 7,000 won. I didn‚Äôt have to wait long for my turn on the cable car, only about five minutes (around 10:45am on a Saturday). The trip up is about two minutes in the cable car, but they reallllly cram people in that thing. The views from the main platforms of the tower were excellent and it was nice to see the love locks as well. They have lots of food options there as well. I did not pay to go up to the observation deck, since I thought it was overpriced, especially when you get such good views from the free platforms. Please note, this is a super crowded attraction, so prepare yourself for that. I then walked back down, since it is much easier going down stairs for me - walk back down took about 10-15 mins for me, going slow. Overall it was worth seeing and you could certainly do it for free if you are fit enough to climb all those stairs.",702,much

I did not think the night view was that fantastic, for the wait it was not worth it for me. We also queued an hr to wait for lift to go down. Bad experience, by the end of the night, my legs were aching so much. The staff there were not doing anything to make the wait more efficient.

However one needs to be careful before going up, since if it is foggy then its a waste as you wont be able to see much. Interesting fact - the tower itself uses lights to indicate whether the visibility is clear or not, so its a good practice to watch for the lights and then make your way there. You can get to the base of the tower for free, which itself is good enough to get a splendid view. But if you want to spend money, you can pay more and make your way up the tower which as a restaurant with a better 360 view. There are two ways to get there - you can trek your way up a nice path or take the bus. The only downside is that it is super crowded, and you need to jostle for space to get a decent view.",704,much

An yes, Korean restraunt up there was really nice and I'll review that separately. But as for the tower, the queue for the cable car up was easily 30 minutes, problems more like 40 plus, and this was a Sunday night. Don't be fooled by the queue for the tickets on ground level, that's just the start of your long, long quest to the top of the building, to get the cable car to the top of the mountain. I call it a quest, as it's almost something worthy of two small hobbits. I had read reviews that mentioned the queues, however I didn't quite read in enough detail to prepare for the queues that lay ahead, and I'm British, we're known for queueing, but I now think we should be handing that title for the Koreans. Then, once you finally get on the cable car and get to the top of the mountain, you can stop and have a look at the views from there, and then queue a further 40 minutes for the lifts up the tower proper. Now a good tip here, is to book a restaurant package to go up the tower, as this skips the lift queue up for you. View from the top is nice, but without the restaurant meal, it would have menat 80 minutes plus of queueing to get there. Then, to come down, repeat all the queuing again, so it was 40 miuntes to the bottom of the tower, which sadly the restaurant meal does not enable you to skip, and then another 40 minutes for the cable car. I know there's a bus to the top that misses the cable car, and we didn't try those so can't comment. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also climb the mountain on foot, althouh we thought that for an evening dinner out that might be a bit much.

It doesn't cost much to go up the tower (only 10000 KRW per person, plus there is a bundle of 2 popcorns + 2 beers for 26000 KRW which we availed of). The top of the tower itself was quite small, in terms of circumference. Only housing a candy store and a souvenir shop were located at the main viewing deck, with a non-advertised coffee shop at the lower floor which we would've gone to and stayed at if we had only known (they're the only accessible non-restaurant establishment with seats).

After getting off the cable car, please proceed to B1 of observatory tower to print your ticket using Klook barcode issued to you.

716,60,834,Here's the scoop : don't take a taxi. Just take bus 02 or 05 from some areas around the city including Myeongdong and it brings you all the up to the base of the tower. It's only 1200 for adults 350 for kids. Same thing when you are returning back. The cable car is 7000 one way for adults and connects from the base of the tower to a middle station. For us we have been in many before and it didn't justify the short ride. Spend some 1-1.5 hours at the base of the tower and take in the beautiful views of the city.

That is what it said in the book on Seoul that I bought in Honolulu before going to Seoul. My wife and I found the opposite to be true. I took as 3 hours to get from where out taxi dropped us off to the top. In retrospect there was a Bus stop sign at the bottom but no idea when it might come so we elected to walk. Three hours later (with seven yellow busses passing us going up during the time it took us to walk there) we arrived with my wife very sore legs and mad. ""Reasonably Flat""... I don't think so.. I would call it steep.  Once we finally arrived it was nice. We went to the upper level W 10,000 each, and got a framed souvenir photo W 25,000 which was nice... you can choose your background of views from the tower.  Unfortunately, it was very cloudy that day, and we couldn't see much of anything of the city from the tower, but they did warn us about that before charging us to go to the upper level, and after that hike we wanted to go up anyway. I think i would be spectacular when it is not cloudy... it was just our bad luck the weather was like that. I hope someday we can go there when the weather is good!  We enjoyed the fence where the lovers attach the padlocks with their names together and took some pictures there, and the Vanilla Shake at the Ice Cream concession was delicious.  We decided to take the cable car back down, which was scenic, but we found that once we arrived it was a long walk to MyongDong Subway Station, which the map implies was colocated with the Cable Car terminal... it is not. It is also a steep road from the Cable Car terminal down, so if you were going to walk up from the MyongDong Subway Station to the cable car terminal it would be quite a hike... although certainly less than the alternative hiking trail.  If we go there again I would either: 1. Wait for the Yellow Bus at the bottom of the Hiking Trail where the taxi dropped us off ... I think he sign at the top said the Bus was only W 1,200 or something like that.  OR 2. Insist that the taxi take you all the way to the Cable Car terminal... and get the hotel or somebody to write that in Korean to show the driver since it appears none of the taxi driver's understand English.  The fare for the Cable Car is almost the same for round trip as one way, so IF you can be sure the taxi will take you all the way to the Cable Car terminal that is probably the best choice. Otherwise the Yellow Bus from the bottom of the hiking trail.  Aside from that I agree with all the other observations of the review by EmmaVestrheim.",717,much

Forgot how much i paid but i feel that it was more than what the place offers. But we went anywhere...went for a train and a bus ride which was very easy to follow.

Ended up, we could not see much of the view and have to constantly get ourselves as near as to the glass and kept wiping the condensed glass. We also felt that the deck was more like a souvenir shop as it was very packed and the walkway was narrow.  Other than that, the line was long too. So there were waiting, lining, waiting and lining.

I walked pretty briskly and it took less than half an hour to get down to the cable station on the ground level. Pretty dark when I descended in a rainy day and I was a little worried about safety but as I walked down I saw quite a few local couples taking a walk up.

Don't expect much from this ride except transportation only. We bought the round ticket. I would recommend only getting a one way ticket. It's quite an easy walk down. It takes about 15-30 mins. There are lots of photo points along the way which the cable car does not offer. Also the wait for the way down was at least 30 mins. It was chaos. We did go up the tower in the elevator. I have to say this part was a waste of money. The views from the first level were amazing. Going up the tower doesn't enhance the view that much. Also it was mayhem in the observation deck. You barely could make it to a window spot and the glass was covered in handprints and smudges. Don't be fooled. The wait for the elevator up was only 15 mins. Coming down was over an hour! Overall tho I would recommend at least going up the cable car. But that's as far as I would go.,748,much

If you wish to go, i recommend you to get combo stuffs. Pay some more and grab some snacks 2) When climbing from Myeongdong, the slope is too high. If your shoes are uncomfy, just take cab or bus up there  Tips If you wish to go for observation deck, i recommend you to look for tickets online. It's nice when you go there at night or during sunset I wouldn't really recommend you to go up to the observation deck as there is nothing much to do up there. There are weekly basis performances and benches just below the tower and it is good enough to have to sight when you are climbing up the mountain.

Once at the top of the tower, you can use coin operated viewing binoculars to view the city surroundings. There are also other photo ops in and around the tower are.

It would have been a nice night view but I went in the afternoon and still get to see the city below. As I hop into the cable car, I can't help but think of Lee Min Ho and Goo Hye Sun in Boys Over Flowers when they were trapped there overnight. All the surrounding trees were rather bare and not much flowers in sight at this time, perhaps later after the rain. In the main square there is cultural performance at 3.00pm and I was lucky to catch it. Very enjoyable. There's a small souvenir shop, a couple of coffee outlets, a hamburger place and a few eateries (but they appear to be closed).

All that is is admission plus a tub of popcorn and a soft drink...( think movie theatre size ).. The circle we made around the tower upstairs was a small round...

Regardless of the experience I have in the cable car, the view up in the N Tower is beautiful and amazing.  Last, beware of touting taxi driver. On our way back thought of taking cab back to our hotel at sines a-Dong, we are been quoted $30k Won.

Once at the top, there are many restaurants, a cable car (which we came back down with) and an observation deck costing W10,000 for access. We went up to the viewing deck, but this was inside, with glass splattered with rain drops and light reflecting from the various tourist tat sellers - basically not really worth the money, the time as it didn't give a much better view than what we'd seen already and yielded poor quality photos.

Tips for those who wish not to spend much money there - just power walk to the tower, don't take the cable car :)  The park is very well maintained/kept. The view of Seoul from the outdoor observatory was just breath-taking. The love-locks are pretty to see. There are restaurants/cafes/stalls as well as souvenir shops.

Before I went there, I read many reviews of other travellers here, and they said you should be ready for long queue for the cable car. So I reached the cable car entrance amost 2 hrs in advance of my dinner booking. Out of my surprise, I did not need to queue at all, I just went there, bought the ticket, then I could go up to the entrance. I waited only for a few minutes, the cable came.  I thought that the cable car would be kind of individual cabinet, but it is not. It is a big one, no seats, able to accomodate 20-25 persons standing inside.  Cable car should be the best way to go to the Tower. I saw many people coming with big tour bus, and they needed to climb up to the hill. Anyway, after I had arrived, I saw many visitors, most of them are mainland Chinese, not very crowded, but noisy.  There are several gift shops and chain restaurants, but nothing special not buy, nor nothing good to eat here. You could take a lot of pictures with the ""love locks"" if you come with your another half.  There, you could buy the ticket to the observatory which is on the 3rd floor. I do not recommend it, though the elevator is interesting. Nothing much to see in the obvservatory. There are very few souvneirs shops, but trust me, the commodities are not interesting to buy though I was ready to, and intended to buy something.  But still, you could have a lunch / dinner at the korean restaurant.  There is also a chained coffee shop, called TWOSOME+, do not go. There is only one staff, so he is always busy and impatient. He might not be good at English, and when I ordered a drink in English, he misunderstood, and gave me another thing, I requested him to exchange, he became even more impatient and the atitudes were bad !  There is a wish pool right next to the coffee shop. I could hardly see something there. Who will throw money into such ""fake"" pool??????  After spending 1 hr on this boring 3rd floor, I went to the destination of this ride - 5th floor - N Grill (french restaurant), which was perfect in service and environment and food.  The view there is wonderful.  I recommend not to go up to this tower, unless you want to spend most time at N Grill. And if you go, it is better to be dinner time. The night view is fantastics. And when you leave, you can see the Seoul tower at night, which is more beautiful than it is during daytime.",778,much

It's a pretty cool attraction, granted, there isn't much to do here (the time we went - early Jan) but the view is nice.  The cable car ride up is fun, and the elevator up to the viewing platform is well thought of - the graphics and concept is a great idea.  There are a few restaurants and caf√©s around, with a neat little souvenir shop - be sure to purchase a tile, and be part of the tile wall. Also - buy a padlock and join the hundreds of others to lock your love on the gate surrounding the building.

It's definitely not the best/coolest tower I've been too, as CN Tower (Toronto, CAN) still ranks in my top 3. I describe it more as a short tower on a big hill. As well, we couldn't see jack from the view as it was extremely hazy.  There were plenty of activities on the plaza as it was kind of touristy. As we were about to leave the first time, they started setting up for a martial show which turned out to be pretty cool. Other than that, I was ready go. Not much to see, overcrowded, and hazy.

You'll see them seated in benches whispering sweet nothings to each other. It was cold and windy that night in September, 2013. Really a good time for couples in love. Another attraction we visited was the Teddy Bear Museum. It was awesome seeing them in all sizes, in different costumes, various themes and some, in action. You really would spend time taking photos not only of these cute bears but photos with them. It was fun. When we were about to leave, there was this light show of the tower itself.

The cable car is one big car that takes about 20-30 people (which is well legal) & it's KRW8000 for a return trip each adult. Once you arrive at the top of the cable car ride it's a reasonable climb ( a million steps according to my missus) to the tower. By going this way there is no disabled access but you can access the Tower by the Seoul City Tour bus if you are getting around in a wheel chair. Once at the Tower there is a variety of things to look at even if you don't want to go up into the viewing platform. There were performers of different sorts, viewing platform, & shaded trees to sit under. The entrance fee to the top of the tower is KRW9000 each for an adult. I thought it was KRW20000 each but when i bought the tickets it was only KRW18000 for both of us-bargain!!!. The ride to the top of the tower is quick & there is a corny video to watch to take your mind of the ride. The view form the tower is quite good but i would suggest being there on a smog free day or you won't have much to look at. Even when we went it was a very nice day but visibility was about 5-10KM. Plenty of trinkets to buy & there is the usual super imposed photo in front of the tower. Quite easy to dodge that one as we didn't speak Korean.You can spend as much time as you like up there & the ride down is as quick as going up. When you're at the bottom of the tower, check out the padlocks of all the gestures of love. Quite impressive really.",786,much
787,131,1487,"Come here in the afternoon just before the sunset the views are amazing and the city comes to life! Watch out if the weather is bad you cannot see that much also on Sunday most offices are closed so the city is not as lit up with the buildings as during the week. Its considered to be a romantic spot so you will see a lot of locals having a romantic stroll around the tower. There are also a lot of restaurants around so you can have a diner and watch the city. Two ways getting there: a cable-cart ride which takes about 4-5 minutes or a walk up, which many locals prefer as its free and healthier rather then the cable-cart. Just after sunset on Sunday while I was there there was a sound and light show on the tower wall which was kind of fun. Highly recommended place and there is a Teddy Bear Museum somewhere close to the tower.... I did not have the time to look for it but I bet its fun as the tower!",787,much
788,132,1490,Locks left by lovers hoping to lock their relationship forever filled the railings of N Seoul Tower. Beautiful sight with benches that are bended in the middle. Great place for photo taking. We took the cable car up and visited the teddy bear museum inside as well. Very cute and informative about the history of Korea during the Joseon and Silla era. We were there during Summer and Korea kind of conserves energy a lot so the place is rather stuffy without much air condition and it's really hot and humid. Try to go when it isn't that cloudy. We went all the way up but it was too cloudy to have a good view of the entire city. Beautiful nonetheless. :),788,much
789,133,1497,"Its a bit pricy to get up top and you have to buy tickets for the cable cart and then for the elevator to get atop the tower. one at the top, the view of Seoul is nice, however at night, they don't dim the lights inside very much and the glare from the lights is very annoying, but what you can see at night is very nice. on the other hand the view from the base, which is atop a small mountain, is also beautiful at night and best of all no glass. The entire location is based around love and romance so really I recommend couples to go here. If its cloudy its not recommended to go atop the tower, as the clouds often hit the top of the tower but not as much the base. Of course winter is the best time to go as visibility from high places is always better in cold weather.",789,much
790,134,1498,"My family went here on early Saturday morning,we took taxi from Myeongdong that cost us $5 but once we get there the taxi is not allowed to enter the park so we took bus No.5 to get up the tower and from there would have to walk 5 minutes to reach the tower.We pretty much see the Seoul area if you walk around so it saves us a bit to stay in the ground rather than paying fee to go up the tower.The lock of love area is fascinating though its quite vandalized.Love lock can be purchase for $8 including pen.though you can hang any sort of stuff and write something on it.Food can be purchase at restaurant and theres dining area outside....a must see area at Seoul....",790,much

If you would like to enjoy food in seoul tower, common sense.. expensive but rommantic. It's up to you. How to go to seoul tower from myungdong ?? cable car or bus. Cable car is about 10 bucks, nice. But you can use a bus all the way to the top of the mountain. Don't be afraid to ask koreans where you can get the bus to seoul tower. Bus fee is much less expensive and fun to experience korean bus, safe and clean..not bad. The sight is always beautiful but best in fall when leaves turn red and yellow. When you return, you can use bus or cable car. In terms of bus, it circles so frequently. No need to remember the bus time table.",791,much

793,137,1525,"We heard that the lights at night were an amazing sight, but we chose to go there after lunch to see the details of the city. We had lunch first in Myeongdong then walked up going to the cable car. The cable car ride costs KRW6000 for a one-way ticket and KRW8000 for a return ticket. We purchased the one way ticket so we can experience the trail going down the mountain. There was still a bit of a climb going up but there were areas that you can rest, take pictures, buy snacks and enjoy the view.  A major to-do in this site especially for couples is to leave a lock with a love message. You can choose to leave the message in the fence or in metal trees. There really is no rule on how to leave your message -- we saw a lot of curious things attached to the fences such as cellphone cases, lunchboxes, keychains, etc. I already brought a used metal padlock from Manila, but we needed to buy a permanent marker and chose a waterproof bagtag from the souvenir shop to write our message. If you don't have a lock, the souvenir shop sells different colored locks (surely more expensive had you purchased it at your local hardware store).  We bought the bundle package tickets to the Observatory and the Teddy Bear museum (KRW14000/adult). The Teddy Bear museum was a cute way to learn about Seoul's history and the Observatory gives you probably the best panoramic view of Seoul. Near the ticketing area, there's a traditional Korea martial arts demonstration that happens every 3pm. Quite cool to watch.  Going down was a very light hike. This was the same trail you'd take if you will not take the cable car, but judging from the facial expressions of those going up they looked very exhausted halfway up.  The whole experience took about 4 hours to complete, but I'd think some people would probably take much longer if they will choose to eat in the restaurant there.",793,much
794,138,1529,"Seoul tower is great! However, with pollution (that locals call fog) - you honestly can't see much of the city. I recommend going at night where you can see the city lights!  BEWARE - there is a fairly steep little hike up to Seoul Tower and the locks. If you have bad knees or ankles, come prepared! You can certainly do it - but no one tells you about the initial initiation into the Seoul Tower hiking club!!  You will need time here if you want to go up into the tower - but otherwise, if you're using the hop on hop off bus - just use the 30 minutes between buses to get a quick view and move on!",794,much
795,139,1536,Nice way to spend an afternoon. About as good of a view of the city as you're going to get -- try to go on a day when there is less smog! I've heard that the view is better at night. Very much a date location. You can even order the couples' package with popcorn and a soda! Reasonably priced and easy to access via bus or cable car.,795,much
796,140,1537,"Loved the tinge of romance in the cold wintry air. The whole idea of placing these love locks all around the N Seoul Tower as a pledge of eternal love is really Winter-Sonata-ish, but worth doing if you wanna just enjoy what the locals do. My wife and I bought the love-locks and love them so much for their cutesy-ness that we brought them home and locked them against our door-grills instead.",796,much

800,144,1596,"Having been to Tokyo Tower, the N Seoul Tower did not give me the ""wow"" experience when I went up to admire the night scenery. It could be because there wasn't much to look out for when at the top. The view at every angle seemed the same to me. Perhaps it could be better if there was a guide pointing out the landmarks to spot when viewing from a certain part of the tower. The only prominent feature I could identify was probably the Han River.  There are also hourly light shows that will be beamed on the tower itself, starting from 8 pm. But honestly, you can skip it and head straight for the tower. It is nothing fanciful.  The place, like every tourist attraction, is full of people, and waiting time to get up to the viewing gallery can span up to 30 minutes (and that was when I visited on a weekday), so I suggest that you avoid weekends or public holidays, which in my opinion, will take even longer.  TIP: Tower admission fees are 9000 won for adults, but you can enjoy a 10% discount if you use the coupon provided when you purchase a Seoul City Pass Plus (their public transport card, but specially for foreigners) card. It is more convenient to get up there via cable car (8000 won for adults, round trip), but if you want some exercise or just want to take a slow stroll up, by all means!",800,much

803,147,1618,"You can't miss the tower, you can see it from all over Seoul.  Its a must try, rated as the most visited place in Seoul for tourists.  There is a cable car at Namsam that brings you up to the tower, or take the bus (Cable car is 8000W for a return trip or 2400W for a bus ride)  The area under the tower is great, it has food stalls, and some great places to take pictures, sit down, chat and talk, the ambiance is great. The views are breathtaking, go at night, on a clear night and you can see pretty much all of Seoul.  There is a souvenir shop, a minimart and several restaurants.  There's an hourly light show on tower, that was fun to watch.  The keychain memorial was pretty unique and good to see.  It was worth going to, we didn't go up anymore to the tower as the kids were having too much fun running around the park.",803,much
804,148,1642,When I went to the tower we took the walking path which was a complete workout but there were many beautiful views that you can appreciate much more as opposed to the cable car.

805,149,1651,"We went to the Tower in late December just before Christmas. And we were lucky to be there in late afternoon so we saw the lights coming on at dusk around the city-you can make out the arteries- streets, bridges because they are completely lit up by cars stuck in the perennial traffic jam. Though a complete tourist trap, if you do want an overview of the hugh metropolis that is Seoul this place is definitely worth a visit. Other than that I do have one more recommendation: Do not miss out on the view from the washroom. (I am speaking for the gents..For a similar experience/view comparable to this, you have to go to the top of a medieval hill town village hundreds of feet above the Mediterranean- Eze, in the Cote d'Azur. The washroom of the restaurant/cafe called the ""golden goat"") While coming down the hill we unwittingly got into a fake taxi that was waiting there to trap foreign tourists. This was the only time in Korea when we got robbed in a cab. (In general our experience with taxis in Korea had been good) A journey to Itaewon that should cost around 5000 won(about $5) turned into ten times as much.( Hint: You try to get into a parked cab. The driver points you to a car behind. You assume that is also a legitimate taxi. It does have a meter. Only one that wouldn't stop jumping for even a split second. Before you know it you owe the guy $75 bucks. We got off for $50.)",805,much

The ride was smooth, but the view from the car and from the tower is nothing special. We went there in the night expecting nice views, but there is too much light which prevents us from getting a good view of the city (see picture).  Lot of young couples around who come to 'lock their love' on the railings of the tower using a paddlock. This seems to be a popular belief. There are restaurants and souvenier shops in the tower.",809,much

There are several restaurants should you feel hungry and want to eat. There is a convenience store for your basic needs. If you are travelling with very small children and elderly, it may be a challenge walking up the steep hill leading to the tower. There is a portion there where there are trees where you can attach your lock as a remembrance until the next time you visit the tower. The best way to reach the top is by car, if not, bus.

You can also take photos of the Tower from that area. Then there is an option to pay to get up the N tower itself. Since we didn‚Äôt want to eat another buffet meal, we only got the tickets with pizza and pasta meal for 2 (not at the top of the tower though), but the pizza especially was superb.

However one needs to be careful before going up, since if it is foggy then its a waste as you wont be able to see much. Interesting fact - the tower itself uses lights to indicate whether the visibility is clear or not, so its a good practice to watch for the lights and then make your way there. You can get to the base of the tower for free, which itself is good enough to get a splendid view. But if you want to spend money, you can pay more and make your way up the tower which as a restaurant with a better 360 view. There are two ways to get there - you can trek your way up a nice path or take the bus. The only downside is that it is super crowded, and you need to jostle for space to get a decent view.",818,much

The top of the tower itself was quite small, in terms of circumference. Only housing a candy store and a souvenir shop were located at the main viewing deck, with a non-advertised coffee shop at the lower floor which we would've gone to and stayed at if we had only known (they're the only accessible non-restaurant establishment with seats).

After getting off the cable car, please proceed to B1 of observatory tower to print your ticket using Klook barcode issued to you.

There are some restrictions for those putting theirs up and if you don't follow their rules, your lock will be removed at the end of the night.

But the hike is very easy - it's reasonably flat and you get pretty good views all the way up. Once at the tower, you need to buy a ticket to go to the observation deck. There is a shopping mall below, so choose to visit that either before or after the observation deck. Then you join the queue, get your photo taken (optional), and then take the lift to the top. Once at the top, there are three different floors full of restaurants and shops.  Tip: If you have Lonely Planet, they have an excellent self-guided walking tour that's very easy to do. It includes a visit to the Old City Wall.  CROWDS It's *so* crowded. Be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes in queues for food, shops, and finding a spot to take photos.  VIEWS Incredible!  Tip: Want to get good views but be away from crowds? We went to the Hancook restaurant where it was VERY quiet. We then sat there, ate slowly, and watched the sunset from our own table in our own space. It's much better then nudging people out of the way on the main floors.  FOOD First we got beer + chips from a coffee shop, and the chips were laughably bad. Then we went and hid in the Hancook restaurant, which was a little overpriced but nice and quiet. We got our own table overlooking the city.  SOUVENIR SHOPPING Some of the best souvenirs I've seen in Seoul! Did all my shopping there.",826,much

Having explored the surroundings under the tower first, I then bought my 10.000 Won ticket and rode the fast lift to the observation deck. The young lady in the lift asked us all to look up to the ceiling of the lift as we started to ascend and the film then took us on a journey much higher than to the top of the Tower - we continued to climb up beyond the earth's atmosphere and into space. Very clever...  At the top I enjoyed stupendous 360¬∞ views over the complete city and way beyond. The sky was beautifully clear and you could see for miles and miles. I liked the fact that at one level you could orientate yourself to your home city/country and one level below you could spot the local sights.  The gift shop at the top was well stocked. I really appreciated the chance to buy a postcard or two with the postage stamps already inserted in the envelope. I just needed to buy an extra stamp to cover the postage back to Europe. And there is a postbox at the top of the Tower. All well thought through. Oh, I forgot to say there is free, strong WiFi connectivity up here.  For me, this is a must for any tourist itinerary of this fascinating city.",830,much

During your trip to the top, you will be obliged to pose for two photos, fortunately, you dont need to purchase them (15000 KRW each, sick!!). On your way down, you will be also ""distilled"" through a gift shop - as the staff is hoping that you will be also tempted to buy some more overpriced things :P  All in all - the beauty of Seoul is here, expensive, but worth it.

Also, Namsan Tower had a lot to offer. I went to the observatory and had the 360 degree view of Seoul. The love locks were great, considering the number of locks that were in there.

After Lotte Tower was built, this Tower became even less attractive. If you are really interested, you can go one time. But it is not in the top 20 things to do in Seoul. To make it interesting, do the trekking from Botanical Garden or Dongguk University up the hill to the Tower.  Also crowded on weekends like everything else in Seoul.",837,much
838,182,2116,"I went on a Thursday night on a bus (not many people using the bus which was good) around 8 pm. The evening was humid with some light rain. When I got to the bus terminus by the tower, the sky was still clear enough for some good night view of Seoul. By the time I got up the observation deck of the tower, it was very noisy and crowded with people, with loud music playing in the background, and bright light inside which cast strong reflections on the glass. All these kind of ruined the night view and made the visit very unatmospheric. Then mist set in and everything was shrouded. I stayed for a short time and left. I have visited quite a number of high towers in different cities and many offer great views day and night. This is probably the worst experience I have had so far. I guess it would be much better if I go during the day on a weekday when the weather is fine.",838,much
839,183,2137,"The view from all around the tower is great and could not ask for better, however you do not need to actually go up the tower. The surrounding views are great on their own and doesn‚Äôt get that much better that it is worth the money. Besides up top is just a massive tourist trap. There are some shops and stuff at the base of the tower that are neat and a Starbucks for your caffeine fix. So overall would make the trip to it again to see the surrounding area but not the top of the tower.",839,much
840,184,2138,"There are a lot of cliche things to do in big cities, and visiting their ""tallest buildings"" is one of them. But this was truly a nice experience. From the lush setting to the fabulous views, it is very much worth the trip. Plus, you can take a tram to get to it. As Miranda's mum would say, ""such fun!"" Not only do you get amazing views of the city, but you can send postcards all over the world! They provide the postage. Make sure you have enough memory free on your phone - you will be taking a lot of pictures. Also, right before the elevator to the top of the tower, the staff take a picture of you that you can purchase later. Very expensive and not worth it. I saw signs that said no pictures, but everyone was. They sell popcorn like you are going to the movies, like this is an EVENT. Inside the elevator they play a short clip that you watch on the ceiling. At first I didn't understand why, but it makes sense. How awkward would it be to be crammed in a silent elevator with 10 other people trying not to make eye contact? Great for the whole family. Tons of food options too. Also, if you are with your boo, you can leave a lock on the railings like the French used to do on the Pont des Arts bridge in Paris. Very cute.",840,much

There are no explanations for what you see (maybe a brief history of some key places would be great!), and I think there were no audio guides either. That's why I give this place 2 stars.

I hardly could take decent shots of the skyline as the glass were blurred by the reflections caused by the bright lighting from the candy and souvenir shops on the deck level.

Just don't expect the food to be more than average, and don't be shocked by the high prices - just remember, you are there for the view. If you are there for anything else, you will be disappointed.

855,199,2231,"When in Seoul, one must visit the N Seoul Tower because.. ""when in Rome"". I'm rating this a 3/5 because of the challenges my family faced when visiting this landmark:  1. We were travelling with my mum who can't walk much. According to multiple taxi drivers, they were not permitted by law to take passengers up. This meant that Mum had to slowly hike up the hill, and mind you it wasn't the easiest of hills to walk up to.  2. Again, mum couldn't walk much. There was no direct access to the top of the tower. Once we reached the hill and boarded the slanted elevator, there were still a series of stairs to climb to finally make it to the entrance of the tower. It was rather handicap-unfriendly.  3. You'd think that after all that climb, the view would be spectacular but it was pretty average. The entrance free to the viewing deck cost KRW10,000 per person and it was indoor. Perhaps I am biased but I thought The Peak in HK was a lot better, must it was outdoor and far more breath-taking.  4. Getting back down was another challenge as you can imagine.  I would still recommend this for those travelling to Seoul for the first time but probably best to go during the cold weather (otherwise you'd be sweating away), you are wearing comfortable shoes, and are not bounded by toddlers/prams/elderly.",855,much

There're multiple bus number which can bring you back to the main city esp if you stay at Myeongdong. Just look at the bored for the location that you're going and wait for 10-15 mins for the bus. The interval is very fast. Very convenient to go there by public. Mini shopping centre below the deck where to can eat or buy drinks like bubble tea but don't expect much from it as the main attraction is still the observation deck. There's also an arcade. Place was very peaceful. Still can oversee the whole of seoul from the shopping area as you can go out and take pictures at a higher level,857,much

Buses to NSeoul Tower is accessible from anywhere in Seoul.Also, going back to Myeongdong or any area in Korea is convenient as buses are available as scheduled.  With respect to natural lighting,best time to go there is from 4 pm to 7pm thus giving a nice effects on your pictures.We'd got so many nice pictures,awesome.

861,205,2376,"Namsan Seoul Tower was built in 1969 as Korea's first integrated transmission tower beaming television and radio broadcasts across the capital. Since opening to the public in 1980, it has become a much-loved Seoul landmark. The tower's main attractions include multi-colored digital art projected onto the tower at night, a digital observatory, a roof terrace, the HanCook restaurant, the n.Grill restaurant, and the Haneul (Sky) Restroom. Namsan Seoul Tower's mountain surroundings on Namsan Mountain have made it a popular place to unwind for locals and tourists alike.  Seoul has a number of viewing platforms where visitors can enjoy the nighttime cityscape or gaze out onto the Hangang (River) but the tower's Digital Observatory is unique, offering an astonishing 360 degree panorama over the city, and 32 LCD screens recounting the 600-year history of Seoul. That is why the observatory is so popular and such a source of pride.  Situated on top of the N Plaza, the Roof Terrace is a spacious wooden viewing deck whose exotic atmosphere makes it very popular with lovers. A recent attraction for courting couples is ""Locks of Love,"" thousands of padlocks attached to the fence by romantic Seoulites symbolizing their undying affection.",861,much

After the sunset you can go to the park beside the tower and theres a show you can watch... its ideal to go up the tower by around 7pm so you can see the beautiful lights of seoul.

Went to check it out in Oct, it was great because the weather was good and sunny. We walked slowly up the hill to get on an elevator lift to the tower (free). Then reached mid upper hill had to buy a return ticket (or single one way up or down - can hike up or down the hill) cable ride to the tower. Negative was the staff will filled up the cable car (packed sardines :/) with enough tourists then start the ride. Enjoyed the great views but not really while in the cable car because can't move around to take pictures. When reached the hill top, there were steps to walk up. There was a lock place, where lovers can buy locks to write their wishes and locked it around the fences which was so romantic and a vending machine to sell flowers. After had to walk up few more steps up and there was a Korean dressed up guard standing there and behind 2 more guards were marching each side of the huge big vases (those were for guards to lit those big vases when enemies entered their provinces -old time). Because it was mid autumn festival, there was a stall that let visitors to put on Korean traditional costumes (free) then took pics with the guards. At the tower, visitors able to buy just visit the tower platform, or tickets that include hello kitty museum and comic characters museum. Both museums are small but kids loved them so much. Up to the viewing plateform, the views were magnificent and spent long time to see how Seoul formed. Seoul was surrounded by mountains, palaces were along those mountains, buildings were not tall and able to see the new develop areas and old areas. Slight dissapointed - did not have places to sit and no much service facilities if compared with Lotte world tower (from namsan world tower you can see the Lotte world tower is right opposite to each other). The ladies toilets have glass all the way down in the cubicles but abit smelly and not clean. Overall it was great experience.",865,much

It was also crowded when we were there, and we saw a very long line for those who are taking the cable car. But it has many stunning view and quite a number of observation areas we can enjoy while we are on our way to the top.

We much more enjoyed the 2nd level as it was less crowded and you got a nicer view, the 2nd level also had more information unlike the top that just seems to be about getting kids to ask their parents for lollies.  We took the cable car up. They PACK the people in so if you dont rush to a side of the cart you basically cant see anything. The cart ride isnt great so if i was to do it again i would just get the bus up.  Once you get to the base of the tower its then more money to get up. I understand they need to pay for everything but it really does feel like a tourist trap.

One of the most amazing things about the tower is definitely the bathrooms, make sure you pay them a visit before you head back down!

I would have preferred to walk up and recommend it for anyone who is capable and willing.  Walking around underneath the tower, there were some areas with ok views. Unfortunately it was a little smoggy that day so you can't see very clearly for long. We got a couple ice cream cones and sat in the back with tables and panoramic glass window looking towards Gangnam. Unfortunately the would be relaxing experience was many times ruined by people dragging chairs across the concrete that creates the most horrific high pitched sound.

There was a place to take pictures half way up....good place to rest your tired legs. Don't forget to bring water!! When I was up there the tower is....i decided NOT to go up on the tower. Bcuz the wiew was so awesome at where I was that the tower it self was not needed. Ofc for those that want to go up to the tower....its worth it I am sure....but I just sat there on til of that mountain...under the tower and watched ppl and the wiew.

I thought the Observatory Deck was pretty much the only attraction but I was really surprised to see that there is actually quite a bit to see and do there with a lot of shops on each floor. So I recommend you allow for about 2 hours of time there. Getting there is very easy, cable car or a bus. If by bus, take the number 2 bus from Chungmuro Station (outside the cinema) and it takes about 20 minutes to the Tower stop. From there it's a five minute walk uphill to the Tower.",881,much

When we arrived at the ticket box there was an ambulance collecting someone that had collapsed from the walk. Once you get up to the tower there is a lot to do- shops, eateries, children's activities, marital arts demonstrations and much more. We stayed here for about 3 hours and then walked down. It was about 20 minutes walk down, but you felt sorry for the people walking up, as it is a long walk. This is a must see when in Seoul.",896,much
897,241,2781,"It is about 15-20 min uphill walk to the Namsan cable car station from Myeongdon station exit 3. Take the cable car to the base of N Seoul Tower.  Nice views when walking to the base of N Seoul Tower from where the cable car stops.  There are many photo spots with 'Love' all over the base of the N Seoul tower, a romantic attraction for couples. I went there alone yet still enjoyed myself very much.  Buy ticket to go up to the observatory deck of the N Seoul tower at the base. The staff will guide you through. You can buy ticket which includes dining or beer but i did not.  I was there from evening til the sky turned dark. Beautiful view. Nice souvenirs at the observatory deck as well.",897,much
898,242,2782,"As a tourist my friend and I were told we had to go here and I'm glad we did! The tower offers a variety of attractions and although we never made it inside it just shows how much there is to do. We got to the tower by taking the subway to Seoul station and left through exit 9. We then walked a short distance forward and the shuttle bus stand was there where we took a shuttle bus straight to the park. Other ways include the subway to Myeongdong and a cable car. You can't take a taxi or a car there as they are trying to reduce the pollution to protect the area.  Once at the location you walk up a HILL to get to the actual tower. Wear good shoes guys! There is lots to do there before even paying to get in the tower (which happened to us because of time constraints). There were different dances and sword fighting displays with a running commentary of South Koreas historical background. This is offered in both Korean and English. They include the audience quite a lot which is great fun! I found myself laughing at the comedic side of it!  There is lots to eat ranging from lunch to dessert and snacks so you won't go hungry.  The iconic love locks are also there. For 8000 won you can buy one or 12000 won you can buy a set of two locks, both come with a free marker pen. You then go to write whatever you want and lock it up on the tower forever! Its an amazing thing to do as it feels like you're leaving a part of yourself in Seoul.  This was all done without paying an entrance fee to get into the tower. Unfortunately we never made it inside due to time constraints but that shows there's a lot of fun stuff to do! Definitely visit there, just give yourself a good amount of time.",898,much
899,243,2810,"We visited the tower since we want to see seoul from above. And we did. It was cold in the beginning of spring and there's not really much up there then the view. There's convenience store, some restaurants, popcorn, candies, and well the view. There's garden below or use the cable car to reach the top. Pay some money again for the tower and on the top is kinda small. Comparing with Tokyo skytree or Tokyo tower, they seem to have more to offer. Still, we enjoy the view from above, it's just gorgeous during sunset and when the nigjt is coming, lights from the city are too.",899,much
900,244,2818,"We didn't go up as it was very expensive and there was a set of stairs up a hill pretty much next to the tower which offered a very similar view for free. I would also say it is not the worth the trip to see just the tower, there are a few parks and recreational rooms (karoake, pc rooms, bars etc. ) nearby to make going to this part of Seoul worth it.",900,much
901,245,2844,"If you're near, go there! If there's been no rain for some time, skip it...you won't see very much. Go a day or so after a good rain and you'll be able to really see Seoul. And plan on dining there, too!",901,much

903,247,2855,"I went there with my kids around December 2016. We took the bus there and it was quite tedious to walk up the slope during cold weather. We had a cup of coffee to warm ourselves up before going to the top point of the tower. There are several shops and restaurants there but unfortunately, one of the store owners (located on the first floor) selling accessories and souvenirs was not friendly. Nevertheless, we didn't let this affect our mood. The scenery at the top is so beautiful. It was nice and we bought quite a few souvenirs from the store there. We also visited the Hello Kitty Island located on the first floor which is so adorable. We all love Hello Kitty & Friends. We spent about an hour there taking pictures. My kids enjoy it so much and have been sharing with their daddy (who missed it) since then lol...he is so jealous about it. We will be going there again (and with daddy this time of course)!",903,much
904,248,2866,The tower is easily accessible. If you don't like to walk the cabs and buses can drop you in frunt of cable car. Otherwise there is a scenic walking path. The scenic beauty is due to cherry blossom trees planted all around the tower. I visited in March. Cherry blossom bloom around april. Unfortunately there was not much to see. If you are visiting in winters . Give the place a miss. View is worth it during spring.,904,much
905,249,2877,"Instead of taking the cable car, I went there by climbing the stairs...it was a bad choice BUT I'm not regretting my choice because it was a spectacular view and experiences! I mean I know you can get the same view if you're using the cable car but it is all up to you..but for me, it was really close to nature and you can see the eldest holding hands like a real relationship goal..duh...since my guesthouse just around the corner so it's really handy. When I was there, I went for 3 packages which includes the Hello Kitty Island (a too much pink-ish place for people who are hate pink), Ssen Toy Museum (yassss! Marvel fan, Star Wars alert!) and Observation deck!..Surprisingly at the Hello Kitty Island was a fun place to enjoy..while the Ssen Toy Museum a place that so amazing..imagine the life size of iron man..okay i need to stop..so the last stop will be the observation deck was well yeah..if you used to go any ob.deck so just the same... when i went down, the surrounding for this tower as you already knew, the lock-ish for couple things, but also good for taking pictures!",905,much
906,250,2913,"You can either get up to the tower by walking or by taking a cable car. We were going to walk but couldn't find the right path so we took the cable car instead. Even though the cable car service was quite organized, there was a long line and we had to wait for about half an hour before we could go up. The way up was nice and I got a lot of cool videos and pictures.  We didn't have time to explore the ground floor of the tower (I did see a hello kitty store tho) but Im pretty sure there were a couple of restaurants or cafes down there. We quickly discovered that you also had to pay to actually go up in the tower which was annoying (since we had already payed for the cable car) but it didn't cost that much. We also had to wait in line to get to the elevator, maybe 15 minutes or so. The view is very pretty once you actually get up. You can see the whole city!! Everybody was taking pictures but the windows till didn't get too crowded. There was a candy store and a souvenir shop on the inner side, I didn't buy anything but there was a wide range of different goods. Overall the trip was fun. I've been to Burj Khalifa so it wasn't that mind-blowing for me but you got a cool view :) We decided to walk down but you can obviously also take the cable car. I think our experience would have been much nicer in the summer, when it's warm and the plants are green. I do recommend coming to the tower... but maybe not in the winter.  *visited with my dad*",906,much
907,251,2914,Didn't go all the way to the top as was too late for it. But pretty sure that I wouldn't spend that much with 4 of us just to go a bit more to the top. Walk and views are great from that point already,907,much
908,252,2946,"This tower offers a nice view on the whole city but well; there isn't much to see. To be honest, the city doesn't look exceptional from the observation floor... A bit disappointed.

909,253,2952,"Sensational view from the top. We were using the hop on hop off Seoul city bus and bought our ticket with our bus ticket and saved 1000KRW per person. Not much up there, but it's a great view. Just shows you how huge Seoul really is!  There's places to eat but they aren't cheap. Recommend going there after lunch, and having a beer at the twosome cafe at the top. It's the level down, where you catch the lift back to ground.  There's a cable car that takes you up there which we didn't utilize but wished we had. Don't know much about it but look into it. Namsam cable car?",909,much

Actually there wasnt much to see but i'm still loving the view and the air! i think it's a nice place for a stroll :)",910,much
911,255,2974,"Been to Namsan Tower twice. The first time was during evening time and my friend and I took the bus to get to the place of which we continued by walking uphill to get to the main area which was quite an exercise haha! The view was really beautiful during evening/night time and I was so overwhelmed with everything that I had tears in my eyes (yes that dramatic haha) but of course, do expect a bit more crowd during night time.  Second time my friend and I went there during noon time on a weekend so we waited for as long as 2 hours to get to the cable car and everything. Make sure you plan well and avoid the weekends as much as possible if you're planning to visit Namsan Tower. However, day time visit offers a different view and better overall experience so it really depends on what you're looking for.  Had a great time on both visits, and one thing is for sure, lots of couples visit Namsan Tower for their dates so if you're single, you might feel a little bit awkward haha :P",911,much

I went on a Monday and there weren't a lot of people so I was able to enjoy the view.  To get here, get off at Myeongdong station. I went through Exit 3 and made a 15-min hike up to the cable car station to get to the tower. Quite an exercise, but it was worth it!",912,much

Hordes of people visited the tower I was there; you are herded into an elevator that doesn't even have glass sides for the view. Once you are at the top the entire area is taken with junk food and stalls selling tourist trinkets. In three minutes you have seen everything - and then you get to stand outside for a long time waiting for the next bus down to the city! Not worth the time.  The length of recommended time i have indicated includes the bus trip - the time needed to ""see"" the tour is about 5 minutes.....",913,much

Not too much impression compared to other Towers such as Taipei 101, Macau Tower, Menara Tower in KL, etc. Though there is an outdoor Deck at the lower level, the N Seoul Tower could still be developed to become more prominent and appealing to Tourists. Overall, the visit is fine and we also enjoyed the tour.",914,much
915,259,3031,"Went there on 1 Jan 17 and we had to queue for an hour to board the cable car to N Seoul Tower (including buying of cable car tickets). The day was foggy, hence there wasn't much view from the observation deck of the tower. What made up for it was the Ssentoy exhibition which my boyfriend enjoyed very much, and the sending of postcards from the observation deck of the tower. There is also a mini photo studio where you can wear hanbok and pay for the photo shoot. We gave it a miss as the costumes did not look very nice. There were some people queuing for the photo shoot though.",915,much
916,260,3035,"Obviously check the forecast. On a cloudy day you simpyl will not see much. It also gets really cold and windy on some occassions  Though if you simply like walking around a bit, it still is ok to go. With the love locks, a pagoda and a bit of shopping and some restos you can still do stuff even without the view.  The cable car ride to the tower is really short. Slightly expensive for its length. Can still offer good views.",916,much
917,261,3043,I think you need to get a perfect day from a weather side. We spent 3 days in Seoul and there was too much fog everyday. We finally went up. It was nice but nothing special compared to other observation building around the world. Hard to see much and not worth the price.,917,much
918,262,3053,"Perhaps i expected too much, but i felt that the N Seoul Tower paled in comparison with other attractions in other cities (e.g. The Peak at Hong Kong).

The bus ride/waiting itself is about an hour +, hence if you dont have much time, you would want to consider taking the cable car.

925,269,3160,"Perhaps it was my poor experience at the buffet restaurant (HanCook), the long wait at the Namsan cable car station, or getting ripped off by taxi drivers at the Namsan cable car station taxi stop - that led me to such a poor rating.  N Seoul Tower is one of your typical observation towers among its brethren - e.g. Space Needle, CN Tower, Calgary Tower, etc. And like these other observation towers, they do provide nice views of the city (probably the best time to arrive to these towers is a little before sunset) at a steep cost.  My first annoyance was the shuttle that they provide from Myeondong (line 1) is very confusing. I waited at the stop and the Namsan Cable Car station shuttle came by. My original intention was to take the bus directly to the tower as it was cheaper than the cable car and I heard not so positive reviews of the cable car. The bus driver, who was clearly English deficient or purposely deceitful, told me I was in the correct bus - then promptly dropped me off at the cable car station. I have to imagine that this is a scam, as you then have no other alternative to get to the tower other than using the cable car. The cable car cost is approximately $7.50 USD vs app. $2 USD for the bus ride. So I relented to buy tickets, only to have to wait around 30-45 minutes for a chance to ride the cable car up (be aware of the Disney-like lines which hide the true wait time).  The cable car itself was standing room only. The views going up were a bit disappointing and IMHO not worth the extra $5.50 USD. You can see a nice view of Myeongdong, but you don't get that super wide panoramic view of the other parts of Seoul. The ride is short as well - app. 3 minutes!  I arrived a little after sunset, so that may have tempered my opinion of the place as the views were much more limited at that time. You do have views of various areas of Seoul, as well as an area where people chained these love locks to a fence (similar to a bridge in Seattle), various restaurants, souvenir shops, etc. I didn't realize the Alive Museum is there (I went to the one in Jeju and wasn't too impressed).  We decided to purchase dinner for HanCook restaurant, the buffet restaurant at the tower for approximately $88 USD for two. The only nice thing about this is that the price includes a trip to the top of the tower. I have a separate review of the restaurant, but I can easily summarize the restaurant as terrible. I was able to walk around the tower after dinner - there isn't too much unique to see in the tower itself. We then took a walk around the area at the base of the tower - and again, there isn't much unique to see in terms of shops or restaurant.  We took the cable car back down - the wait was much less. The trip down was uneventful. However, I arrived back at the cable car station base a little after 8:30 PM and unfortunately, the last bus to Myeongdong departs at 8:30 PM! Obviously, the cable car station ticket office doesn't warn you about this. Accordingly, you are left to the wolves - in this case, the taxi drivers. I didn't want to walk back to Myeongdong so I approached a taxi driver for a ride back to Myeongdong. The taxi driver immediately indicated it would cost me a 20000 won rate up front, $17 USD for essentially driving less than a few miles (and actually, Myeongdong is literally only a mile or two away from the Namsan cable car station)! I should have called an UberBlack car at that time instead of taking the taxi... But the lesson is - beware of the Seoul taxi drivers!  Anyway, N Seoul Tower should probably low on your priority list of Seoul attractions as there are many other worthwhile attractions to go to.",925,much
926,270,3188,"The N Seoul Tower was an interesting site in that it seemed to offer different people different things. There was an element of fun mixed in to the back drop of the great views of the city plus the trees and nature that is the Namsan Park.  I didn't go up to the observation deck itself. I chose to stick to the viewing platforms around the tower which provided multi level views of different sides of the city.  One of the striking elements would be the love locks that are pretty much every where. A lot of couples come up here and the sheer number of locks is a testament to that. Whilst I came here during the day time you can imagine during sunset and the evening that this would be site for many couples seeking a romantic respite from the city below.  Around the tower itself, aside from the park, are restaurants and cafes that give you the opportunity to just relax and enjoy the environment. For families aside from letting the kids run around for a bit there are fun characters to take photos with.  Whilst I wouldn't necessarily say it's a must see I'd suggest choosing a time of day that meets the objectives of your visit whether it be as a group, family, couple or Individual and just enjoy chill out and enjoy yourself.  Note: I took the cable car up and a bus down. The walk from the metro station to the cable car station is very steep so take it slow walking up or consider getting a taxi if you're with people less mobile.",926,much

929,273,3202,"For a first time visit to Seoul, it would be good to consider the N Seoul Tower as one of your destinations. Of course, there are other similar places such as 63 Building for instance, but N Seoul Tower would be the easiest for a first time visitor.  To get up to N Seoul Tower, you would have to get to the Namsan Cable Car first. The cable car itself is about 15 minutes walk from Myeongdong Station. The cable car will get you up to the top of Namsan Park in about less than 5 minutes. However, be prepared for a wait of about 30 minutes at least during peak hours. Of course, there is the walking option from the bottom if you do not wish to wait that long.  If you wish to take a good shot at sunset or at night, I would say that it is actually better to take it from Namsan Park right outside the N Seoul Tower, rather than at N Seoul Tower itself. As we went during sunset time, it was quite crowded even outside N Seoul Tower itself, but the views are quite amazing even then. I would advise coming early to get a good view.  We went up to N Seoul Tower and found that the views are great, but there is not really too much difference from the views outside N Seoul Tower though. Because of the glass panels at the observation deck, it can be a little difficult to take photos without having reflection in it. It is better to go during the daytime if you wish to go up to the N Seoul Tower in my opinion.  There are a few restaurants serving those who are hungry for a reasonable price, along with a good view of the Seoul skyline as well. Overall, I would say N Seoul Tower would be good to visit once, but there are probably other better places to view the Seoul skyline, perhaps even for free too without the crowds.",929,much
930,274,3217,"We are residents in Seoul since 4 years and we went every year more as twice up to the tower. It was a nice green place within a busy town. I remember 3 years ago it was a relaxing walk up and down and also the tower area was quite peaceful. Somehow I have the feeling it is worsening year by year. The operator has started to renovate and offer now several floors with shops, restaurants and whatsoever. Some of them opened and just closed again. LOL. Why? Because probably not many people will spend a penny there. There are mainly interested in making selfies. That's it. And who shall buy all these things you really don't need? We went there and left every time at least 50k for tower entrance and a beer, coffee or ice cream. There were a few shops totally enough to serve visitors. And usually you climb up to have a nice few and not to drink and eat whole day long. Anyway this time is over for us spending any coin there. This year every time we visited the place it was totally over crowded. If you want to visit tower's upper floor you shall wait at least an hour or even more. Especially on the weekends. Same way down. I can be wrong but since 2015 it changed dramatically. We usually walking either up or down along the small road. I remember the time when we saw many people using the bike to go up. Time is over. Now every minute some old diesel engine is rushing uphill to unload and to come back to collect again. Some of them are driving fast and reckless. If you have kids you are mainly busy with watching them because you are afraid that something happened. I really wonder why Seoul citizens are not doing much about it. Did they gave up already? Do they like how it is? This place becomes really disgusting. It has nothing to do anymore with a nice, beautiful, quiet, green, park and place. It just became a polluted place of commerce. We will not visit again. We are done with this tower. Have fun.",930,much

We were the only ones in there at the time and had a blast being silly, and taking a ton of silly pictures. Coming from the US, Hello Kitty World is a novelty item for us.",931,much

The elevator takes you to the top and you can spend as much time as you like taking in the view of a very, very crowded city of skyscrapers. It is hard to believe the amount of people (10 million) who live in the city until you see the vast spread of high rise living. Next, go down a level, that I think is actually better than the top level. Go down to the bottom and spend time looking at all the love locks.....they are EVERYWHERE. We rode the cable car down ..just for the fun of it. Otherwise you can use the steps to get back down to street level or catch the bus.",932,much

It is a bit much to walk up in the dark narrow road. So take the cable car. Be sure to stand at the windows of the cable car to see the view going or coming down. You have to pay a separate entrance fee to go up the Seoul Tower. The sight up there is just ok, but I guess as a one time visitor you ought to try. The souvenir shop at the top and the lighting inside distract the view towards outside at night. While there, do not miss the locks of love at the foot of the tower.

I made the mistake of not doing my research and going on a Korean national holiday, so it was really crowded. I waited an hour and a half to get to the top, and when I got there the NBurger restaurant had run out of burgers. So, if you can, make sure to go on a weekday when there isn't a holiday.

938,282,3340,"Well, we have visited many Sky Towers in different cities in our walk around the world and every time when we come across a new one, we would not hesitate to visit it because the view on the city will be different and will gain unique and wonderful experience.  So in our recent Seoul trip, we decided to visit the N Seoul Tower. It was about past 4.00pm when we arrived and the place was still crowded with visitors mostly foreigners. The viewing point on the ground floor was already awesome and it was built on top on the hill. Along the way, we saw trees with ""LOVE LOCKS"" besides the the mental railings that also have such locks too! It was so colourful and impressive! Unlike the love lock bridges in European cities, mostly located above a river where one would throw the keys into the river after locking it, right here, there is no river but one can throw the keys down the hill! Haha. (you can actually buy a lock in the souvenir shop)  Upon entering the tower via the main entrance, we immediately saw a souvenir and gift shop with a lovely Hello Kitty display at its entrance and no one could withstand the temptation for not taking a photo with it.  Our fullday city tour guide had gone to the ticketing booth to get us the ticket to the top while we were busy taking photos with the Hello Kitty!  Then we took the elevator to the top (according to our guide, the tower was about 250m tall, about 80 storeys if I didn't remember wrongly). While most elevators in other Towers are standard and quite ""boring"" while moving upwards, the ceiling of the elevator here has astonishing moving animations (that depicted moving into the space galaxy) and it was indeed impressive. So everyone in the elevator were kept occupied and so focused on it and forgot the ""time spent"" in getting up there. (anyway, it was quite fast too, think less than a minute)  When we arrived at the top, wow! The view here was spectacular! We walked around 360 degree and really have had a great bird eye's view on Seoul, could see the Gangnam area (South of the Han River), Myeongdong etc. As the sky was still bright, the view was cleared! We really enjoyed the view so much!  There is also a souvenir and gift store right well where you could grab some candies, t-shirts, postcards etc here. Though the place is touristy but they had some promotions and so the items we grabbed here were still reasonable in price.  After our visit here, we took the elevator down to the 1st storey where we had to walk through a ""tunnel"" with LED TVs on both sides featuring Seoul in different times and development phases via computer graphics and animations (on the other side, they also have TV screens that show the history of the country as one walks around). It was very interesting and fascinating and no doubt why Korea is so advance in IT and technology!  Well, if you like heights and good city view from the top of the world, this place will be relevant and good for you. As mentioned earlier, each sky tower is different and offer different and unique views on the city and so it's unfair to compare with one to another. Visit with an open mind and with the feeling to see and experience new and different things, your visit here will be fun, interesting and wonderful!",938,much
939,283,3355,We prefer night visit as the tower looks amazing with its colourful lightings. There isn't much to see inside the tower except admiring the city of Seoul in 360 deg. Of course you can leave without noticing the Love locks everywhere.,939,much
940,284,3357,"Going up any tower like this will provide the best views of the city. You can walk up but is a hard climb. Alternatively you can get the cable car up. The prices are moderate, but you can't miss this. There are tours which also take you up, this cost much more.",940,much
941,285,3364,"Got a entrance package that cost W26,000 with 2 entrance tic, 2 beer and a popcorn. That was the worst pop corn i ever had! But the rest was good. Not a very fascinating tower with a lot of people fighting to take picture at the window, so not much peaceful place for you to get a peaceful high view from top. Which I believe is the same in most part of the towel in the world. If you do not want to buy a ticket, just walk around the towel at the place where the tourist hang the lock. Is another nice place also, but free. Oh, the towel has transparent toilet....",941,much
942,286,3377,"Fascinating place to visit. So much more than just the view, which would be worth the visit on it's own. The walk through the park was very peaceful, but very steep in parts. If that is a concern the cable car is a less strenuous way of getting to the top.",942,much
943,287,3393,"It is a nice view even from the decks without going up the tower. You can have a beautiful view of Seoul especially when the weather is bright and clear. When we were up there, there was also a performance and also the opportunity to wear Hanbok (traditional Korean attire) for those who are interested. Namsan is the place where people would put their lock of love and leave it there. If you forgot to buy one prior to your visit, there is a souvenir shop which sells those locks and gifts too.I would say you can buy cheaper locks before you get up but I guess the locks up there are fancier. My family and I decided to not go up the tower since it was foggy the day we visit. We figured it wouldn't be worth a visit as we couldn't see much, either. I would strongly recommended to go either at night or on a clear day so that you can get the most out of your visit. A foggy day isn't exactly they best but if that is the only choice you have, just staying at the deck would be enough.",943,much
944,288,3394,View is great! Do not expect much in the observatory. Two ways to get to the tower: 1. ride the cable car which is very expensive because you'll be standing with 49 other people 2. use stairs via Namsan Park,944,much
945,289,3406,"We went up with the cable car, overall nice view but nothing more. There's the lock your love thing going on there where couple pot locks on practically anything willing to hold it around the tower and promise their love to one another. It's nice but nothing too much",945,much
946,290,3433,"Breathtaking views. Fresh air. I dare you to attempt to hike all the way up. Great for a workout and build up an appetite. Expect crowds during weekends and Korean holidays. If you don't wish to climb it, you can pay for a cable car to take you to the top and escort you down. But I don't know how much it costs because I hiked the whole thing.",946,much
947,291,3446,"We went up to see the view from the tower, but all we could see was the haze and pollution coming from China to Korea. Would have been much better at night to see the lights.",947,much
948,292,3449,Gives you a nice view of Seoul. It was our first time to ride a cable car so that was fun but a bit scary for me. There were too many visitors both locals and tourists. There was a small area for lovelocks just like in Paris. Nothing really much to do there except take photos. No need to go up the tower really.,948,much

Easy to go by bus. I would not to go again... a place just visit once and it is enough.",950,much
951,295,3505,"Seoul N tower is just other tower, where you can see the view of the city. When we came, it was drizzling, and sky was cloudy and so we could not see much. in my view eventhoug it was a pefect sunny day, the view was ok, nothing special. But they were very creative with the padlocks that visitors put on the fence and places, that create interesting decorations.",951,much
952,296,3526,"It was so nice to reach to the top of the tower, i recommend you go at night to see the view. It was much more exciting. I bought the ticket from TravoAsia, just search it online or mobile app. they offer better discount. They seems focus on Korea and JP only at the moment. Anyway, i believe its worth to check out. Good Luck",952,much
953,297,3577,A day trip exploring seoul took us to the tower and many palaces Recommended the lifts in the tower lead to a good view without much walking,953,much
954,298,3580,"It cost about 22,000 won to go on top of the tower and it comes with free drink n big size popcorn. They offers few packages tower tour. There will be a mini studio for photo session at the entrance, u can buy ur photo 1pc at 12k won and 2pcs for 15k won. They have 3 michelin star restaurant but u have to booking online to dine in. There's no much different of panoramic view from the bottom and top of the tower. Countless of love lock hanging on the wall of a terrace attached to the tower. You can buy the love lock from souvenir shop but its very expensive. We get to the tower by bus. It was heavy rain and windy so they closed the cable car and the hiking trail as well. Nothing much we can do, it was too cold and raining. Maybe summer is the best time to visit N tower.",954,much
955,299,3581,"Getting on the tower requires either robust legs/ vehicular transport/ paying for and squeezing inside a cable car.  Atop the tower, you have to pay to get on the observation deck, and worse, its nothing much to see on a cloudy day...",955,much
956,300,3597,"Morning time is rhe best time to see the N tower  It shows all seoul . And while you there you can try some of the perfect options they offer , there is a wood laser machine that print picture on a peace of wood You can take a picture by your self over tgere or by the help of the other people , but i recomend that you use an old picture you like the most  The prices not that much There is also an italian resturant Thire pizza is a must try",956,much
957,301,3625,"The N Tower is fun to visit - you can see the panorama of Seoul and even put a little lock with your name on the ""tree-lock"". The way up to the lift is long, windy and arduous - hence, use the inclining lift cabin on the main road - it's much more fun, unless you're into hiking!  There is a shop at the bottom of the cabin which offers all kind of merchandise - don't be tempted, as prices are atrocious and you can get things twice as cheap in the town.  Purchase a return ticket - don't be tempted to purchase a ticket with a meal- and off you go.  There is a lift that could take you up the 5 flights of stairs, but only if you're very old or very pregnant :) - we braved the lift anyway and were told that we have to be ""punished"" by waiting 10 min for such ""disobedience"". The visitors are lined up in a very ""military"" / ""communist regime"" style - you do what you told! - but this is all part of the experience!  Up the top, there are more steps to conquer - then, you're (almost) at the top. The views are great, and there are plenty of opportunities for the photographs and selfies.  There is a concert available on a daily basis , - worth watching for a bit, and there are plants of eateries up the top, although the prices are higher that in downtown Seoul.  In the way back, try to take you place on the bottom right corner of the cable car - that's where you can have the best view as the car descends to the ground.",957,much
958,302,3646,"This is a very amazing place since I can't do the same at home for me the experience is unique. I took the Namsan cable car to the tower and the view is beautiful; best time to go is on the afternoon to watch the sunset. This is a place where many couples go to, you would find locks representing their love before going into the tower. They have gift shops and restaurant/cafe inside the tower. Ticket was about $10.00 or 10,000 won per person. There's not much to do unless you are with company and are going to eat in there.",958,much
959,303,3662,"You will know this is the seoul tower when you see it far away. Maybe I was expecting an amazing view but this is just an average view. If you don't have time, you are not missing much. This is something I would come see once for the experience but I wouldn't come for a second time. I recommend coming 1 hour before the sun sets so you can see the day and night view at once. Don't come on raining/cloudy days or you won't see much.",959,much
960,304,3698,"Wasn't expecting to catch the cherry blossoms so late in the season. Was 2 week of April. There were at least 7-10 bus loads worth of tourists near the foot of the tower. We had wandered away from the crowds, looking for a good photo opportunity along roads less travelled and threaded upon. Was first our stop in Seoul, was a lovely start to our trip. Seoul little time..... Seoul much to do!!!",960,much
961,305,3734,"The view from the Tower is not so different from the base of the tower in my opinion. The glass at the top is not as transparent/too much glare so you can only see when you are right up to the window (whereas I have been to other towers and it's completely clear from wherever you stand). Having said that it's pretty economical to go up (10,000 per person, 21,000 for two people plus a huge popcorn and two drinks!)  Popular couples spot but fun for families and solo travellers as well :)",961,much
962,306,3764,Beautiful at night. We did not go up the tower but only went up to the platform to do our locks of love. Even that scenery is nice... much less the one at the top! Go at night for a better view!,962,much
963,307,3766,nothing much to shop around. only good thing is the night view. shuttle bus was crowded. left after an hour,963,much
964,308,3781,"The observation deck is small, and there is not much story-telling or explanation of the places you can see from the tower. The gifts sold on site are exquisite, and that's the best part of the place.",964,much
965,309,3802,"Went here at night so the experoence might be different during the day.  It is a long ride to the top and when you get there you can view the city from behind a 360 degree glass viewing deck.  Aside from the shops and food not much to do here, I would rather have spent the time doing something else.",965,much
966,310,3803,"It's a really nice view, but not really worth the wait and fre to go to the observation deck. You get pretty much the same view at the base of the tower. If you are going up, do it in the evening when it's dark. It's so much cooler to see the city lit up by all the lights.",966,much
967,311,3808,I wanted to visit this tower so much. It was so peaceful and beautiful. This has to be in your top 10 places to visit in Seoul.,967,much
968,312,3822,Very long climb and not much to do from the top except take photos and get a nice view of Seoul.  Because of the long climb you can easily spend 3 hours in the area which is better spent elsewhere.  The viewing area is enclosed so not very romantic. The locks area is cool for couples though!  Would just visit this once but there are better places to go.,968,much
969,313,3826,"I visited seoul tower in the month of July. It was my birthday so I got a good discount for visiting seoul tower. They also offer many foreigners and couples discount. Tower was just fine as there was nothing much to do. View from the top was good and that's all. Get some pictures clicked with a background view and you are done. You can also purchase souvenirs for yourself. We carried out our own lunch so dont have much idea about the food services there. After having our lunch, we visited the alive museum which was right next to the Seoul tower. I would highly recommend you to visit Alive museum if you want to have super fun and planning to visit Seoul tower. Otherwise, visiting seoul tower alone is a complete waste of time in my opinion. Good luck!!! :)",969,much
970,314,3827,"We had the wrong time to visit N Seoul Tower (there was a scheduled fireworks display and so the place, being up high and a good viewing area, was jampacked with people) so we did not enjoy it much. It was even difficult to get on a bus from somewhere near Myeongdong to N Seoul Tower. If it were a different day, it would have been better :) That aside, I think NSeoulTower area is an entertaining place, with food places, Bear museum, good view of Seoul and a good place to walk around (be prepared if you want to walk uphill though).",970,much
971,315,3841,I was stupid enough to want to walk there. DON'T. The road takes you round and round around the tower instead of straight to it. Just take the bus there it's much easier. You can take the bus to the Tower from meongdong. The tower itself was very expensive. Too expensive. So I didn't bother going up there even though it took me an hour and a half to walk there. The view from the bottom of the tower was already nice so I didn't want to pay 22000 won to go further up for apparently nothing.,971,much
972,316,3844,"Well, nothing much to talk about this place..but the scenery was amazing esp at night. I went in Feb this year, decided not to take the cable car and climb up to the top with my own foot(worst decision ever..), i wish someone would carry me, unfortunately..not be able to find one. I don't spend too much time here, 1hr is enough because its too crowded..people everywhere, really hard to find a good spot for me to take a picture(sighed). But still worth a visit.",972,much
973,317,3845,"I've been wanting to come here ever since I first saw that cable car scene from My Lovely Sam Soon and was not disappointed! We planned to arrive during sunset and the hotel I was staying is pretty nearby, so we decided to walk on over. The walk up to the cable car station wasn't bad at all, probably because there is this elevator/ramp hybrid thing that helps you up this last steep portion. The cable cars were really cool to ride in although they do kind of pack you in since there are a lot of people.  Once you get to the top you have to climb a few more flights of stairs, which isn't bad, but may be for those with mobility issues. Once you get close to the top you can start to see all the locks of love. There were quite a few vendors selling locks so those looking to lock their love last minute don't have to worry. The view below the tower is really gorgeous although it was a bit windy when we went. There are quite a few restaurants/shops around the bottom of the tower for those who are hungry from the climb.  The tower costs an additional extra to go up to and we bought the package deal in which popcorn/drinks are included. It's funny how they play this scene that you're blasting off to space as you ascend in the elevator. Once you get to the top of the tower, it's pretty much a 360 degree view of Seoul with souvenir shops in the middle. I like how on each window it tells you how far you are from a major city in the world and it's nice to sit down and chill next to a pretty view .  There's not a wholeee lot to do here besides admiring the scenery, but the entire experience was definitely worth it and fun!",973,much
974,318,3847,"Twice I've been there during winter. I love walking up the slope and looking at the scenery and how the trees cast shadows on the path. I'm not sure how it'll feel for summer though. The wind can be a little too much for winter and high altitude. I think u have to go up the tower itself so that you won't get blown away. Same, I think scenery up the tower is best when you go just before sunset so that you can enjoy 2 different feel.",974,much
975,319,3855,"Hit the cable car walk round the summit once then bail.  Amazing views, inexpensive with a sweet cable ride in & out.  Highlights: views Lowlights: not much education as to why it exists.",975,much
976,320,3873,This attraction isn't the cheapest in Seoul but it's definitely good if you want great views of Seoul. The first time I went it was foggy and I couldn't really see much so they give me a ticket to go back. This was good for me because I was in Korea for a year but not so good if you are only there for a short period of time. So it's definitely worth checking the weather before going. I've been both day and night time. During the day it's a nice walk through Namsan Park up to the tower and there was different games and activities going on outside of the tower. On the night time the tower is lit up and the views from the top were amazing! So it really just depends what you want to see. I've walked up and took the cable car. The walk was nice but can take a while so again it depends if you like the walk or just want to see the tower. The restaurant in the tower is nice and you can get a combo ticket for a meal and entry but it is also very expensive. There's a gift shop in the tower also.,976,much
977,321,3875,"Seoul tower was amazing! The views were great and there was so much to do inside the tower like take fun pictures, eat and of course shop! The hike to the tower was fun although tiring for those not in the best shape, but worth it!",977,much
978,322,3879,We didn't feel much great here. Its like normal mountain where you can find city view. Its not unique things for sure. I think its suitable for couples.,978,much
979,323,3885,"The views were good and the facilities - restrooms, eating/dining were good and there's a plaza that is currently being constructed. I enjoyed the view from the top - however it wasn't that much better than the view from the hill, so I'm not sure it justified the price tag!",979,much
980,324,3892,I once visited this place with my father and siblings. Being here was so pleasant and fun. Me and my siblings had so much fun. This place reminds me of the time I had with my family.,980,much
981,325,3908,"We decided to take the cable car up and walk down. This was indeed the correct decision. If you decide to walk up be prepared for a tough climb. There was a 30 minute queue for the cable car and we were jammed into the car like sardines, but still it got us up to the tower OK and without breaking a sweat.  At the tower we were a bit confused about which ticket to buy. There was the observation tower and a combined Tower and Pavilion ticket, but it was not clear what the Pavilion actually was. Finally we bought a beer package which was access to the observation tower for 2 persons and a beer each for 26,000 in total. Not bad considering the tower alone would have been 20,000. cheapest beer we had in Seoul ha ha. You need to collect your beer though before you take the elevator to the top.  The views are pretty average. Its not like the Eiffel tower where you are looking down on so many historic places. Here you pretty much just see a concrete jungle.  When we came down we bought a lock and wrote our message on it and hung it on the fence. Kind of quirky but we enjoyed it. Finally we walked down to the bottom which is very enjoyable and recommended.",981,much
982,326,3939,"It is easy to get to N Seoul Tower (travelled by train, forgot the station name, Tourist Information is very helpful if you ask them). It is a beautiful place, very scenic, I think everyone who visits Seoul should go to. Remember to have your camera. I recommend this for anyone however, for those with leg problem, they can only stay around Seoul Tower as the staircase is very very long to get to the top to look at the love lock. We had a great time there and took lots of pictures. My family and I enjoyed it very much (despite the bitter winter).",982,much

We have visited in the daytime& it was foggy but we could still see well, and we have also visited at night, which offers its own beautiful view of Seoul. The gift shop has fun little souvenirs. Get directions on taking the bus here. It is much easier, especially when visiting with children. The tram is fun, but too much waiting & walking, so we prefer the bus .",984,much
985,329,3970,"I've been to Seoul multiple times, but never made it up to the tower until this last visit. It was pretty much what I expected (def. not lacking on cheesy-tourist stands/tchotchkes), but I'm giving it 4 stars still because of the absolutely gorgeous views of Seoul. They even have little map lines on the windows so you can see what neighborhoods you're looking at... Plus you ""blast off"" to space in the elevator which is pretty hilarious and awesome.  Just for the views alone, I'd recommend everyone going at least once!",985,much
986,330,3977,We took the Cable Car up to the mountain then the elevator up to the observation deck. You are asked to look up in the elevator and watch a corny spectacle on a TV above you and are told that it takes 30 seconds to the top. Nice view. Best to go on a clear day when there is not much fog. Very people with a lot of people.,986,much
987,331,3981,We came here during cherry blossom - we took cable car and the view was lovely. Nothing much to see in N seoul tower though but it still attract both local and international tourist (like us). It famous with amongst korean drama fans (like me) so yes we take a visit there.,987,much
988,332,3990,"We visited N Seoul Tower at the end of a gray day, so the views were compromised; however, we had a blast! The best fun was the ride up in the cable car. It started snowing and this was quite beautiful. As it was a bit dark out, the views weren't much and the tower itself pales a bit compared to Taipei 101 or the Tokyo Tower, but it is still fun, just a bit touristy. The coup was in walking down through the park. This was a joy and perhaps the most fun of the trip. The tower I could take or leave but the fun of wandering down from it was relaxing and fun.",988,much
989,333,3995,"We truly enjoy hiking to the top of Namsan to the tower. It is a good climb and we finish it off with a churro and ice cream or a burger. As you are climbing, cut off the main trail and onto the smaller trails through the trees. It is steeper, but much faster and more fun.",989,much
990,334,4043,"My family and I decided to take the hike up to the N Seoul Tower rather than the cable cars since it had about a 2 hour wait. The hike can get steep and considering how out of shape I am, it was exhausting! You get great views with this hike, and many photo opportunities which I really enjoyed. Once we reached the top, I was just happy that I no longer had to walk! Hah. We purchased our tickets, ant it was about a 1 hour 15 minute walk. We ate at one of the restaurants that offered burgers and beers. All very delicious! We bought the ticket package that offered a free soda and popcorn. And man, that was a lot of popcorn! Completely not necessary. Once we got to the top, it was extremely crowded. The glass were extremely dirty so it was hard to get a good look out. The wait for the elevator ride back down took about 40 minutes. I am much more of a fan of the 63 City Tower.",990,much
991,335,4080,Went to the N Seoul tower area at night time. It was not too crowded so made for a nicer viewing experience. It's not overly cheap for a ride to the top but it's a rather nice view. It's worth a visit if you want a nice view of the city. Can take as much or as little time as you like.,991,much
992,336,4088,We walked uphill to reach the tower. It was good exercise and a much needed one too! The view from the top was breathtaking!,992,much
993,337,4100,"The view of N Seoul Tower was so perfect for couples in love, with all the paddlocks they left behind to show how much they loved each other. The time I were there a feeling of loneliness suddenly set in. Becasuse I lost my husband 16 years ago. But after seeing lots of couples enjoyed taking pictures at that romantic place, I was relieved of the loneliness and feel very happy for them.",993,much
994,338,4101,"Came here in mid November and still had a great look of Autumn leaves. If going to the tower is your thing, it is 9000 won per person without any deals. I breezed through it as there is only so long you can look at city views. On the other hand, the base of the tower gives good enough views at all 360 degrees and there's restaurants and cafes to spend time there too. I highly recommend at least taking the 30 minutes walk down after you're done. You save some money and is a very pleasant walk. Lastly, choose a clear and sunny day, otherwise there's nothing much to see.",994,much
995,339,4110,The line up to the Observatory will take about 40minutes. Once at the the tower I was in awe seeing all the city lights. The view is awesome. But there isn't much activity so after a few photos taken we went back down. It takes more time to line up than staying on top of the tower for the view of Seoul City,995,much
996,340,4119,"We took the Seoul city tour bus up to the tower. You still have to go up an incline to get to the base of the tower. The place is quite crowded with many tourists. And it is a bit of wait to go up. It's extremely expensive. It is not much different from visiting the Empire State Building or the CN tower. When we were there, one of the women's toilet exploded. Quite gross, but not much you can do when someone overstuffed the thing.",996,much
997,341,4124,Went here yesterday and finally after 3 hours managed to get to the top of the n tower. Be prepared to wait. And be prepared to wait a long time!! We waited over an hour just to get on the cable car and then had to wait again to go up the tower. The cable car takes you up the steep hill to the base of the tower and then you need to take the elevator to the top. It is possible to walk to the base of the tower but it is quite a long steep walk. That may be preferable to waiting the 70 mins we waited for the cable car though  Views from the top are magnificent though. Make sure your going on a clear day as you'd be pretty annoyed to wait so long to get up to not see much,997,much
998,342,4146,"The N Seoul Tower was a serious touristy spot. The night we went was incredibly crowded - they had several busses of kids there touring the tower so our wait to even get up to the elevators was and hour or so long. Once we got to the top, the view was gorgeous. Seoul was a huge city! Our way down took almost just as long as it did to go up. There was a line that snaked around to wait for the two elevators to take us back to the cable car. You pay a few extra dollars, but it's worth it to take the cable car down to the ground floor. Overall, I'm not too much into crowded places so probably won't be back again. However, I am a believer of always trying things as least once!",998,much

Korea doesn't have much in the way of architectural landmarks - at least, not as many as some other tourist hotspots - but this tower has always provided a focal point in the Seoul city skyline.  The surrounding area under the tower has a handful of souvenir stores, restaurants, and cafes while the tower itself provides some good eats married with good views of the city.  A meal at the N Seoul Tower at night proves to be a great activity... just remember to cross your fingers and hope that no fog nor smog ruin the views during your visit.",1000,much

1003,347,4192,"Long queue up to Namsan Tower. Was advised that the best view is during sunset but missed it due to the long queue to the foothill of the tower.

1005,349,4195,"We bought tickets to go to the observatory, glad we used a discount coupon. It's like we bought entrance tickets to a souvenir shop to be honest. A short elevator ride and an even shorter walk around the observatory. Nothing much to see or do there.  The vicinity is nice, interesting to see all the locks and the night view of Seoul but no need to go up the observatory. I find that it's a waste of time and money (even if it was relatively cheap using coupons).",1005,much

We took the local bus to get there, which is so much cheaper than the cable car, but we did get stuck in traffic which was annoying.

1012,356,4249,I was pleased to send postcards from such place.  The tower itself is only ~200m and it costs 6000w to get to the top. Bit too much considering how hard it is to get there by foot or 8500w cost of round trip in a cable car. Not recommended.,1012,much

What please me here, I see many lovers, couples, souvenir, Ice cream, sweets, coffee, a good panoramic view, you are not visiting Seoul, if your vacation planner omit this one, we had a good time with students from Myanmar. I miss our guide Ms. Jeinie!",1015,much
1016,360,4305,Such a notable landmark so you really do need to do this at least once. Many nice places for photo opportunities. Seen in many dramas the site where all of the locks from couples are. We went late at night and didn't have much of a wait time. Night view was beautiful though probably day time view would have been better to see all the detail sections of Seoul. But we weren't really wanting to go so bad that we would stand in line for 2 hours as some of the reviews stated. Late night we waited about 10 minutes.,1016,much

There is a lift but we came at it from the wrong direction and never found it, so plan it out properly or you will be sorry like we were! The tower itself is nothing too special, the view is nice and the windows point you in the direction of other countries so that's kind of cool. You can send postcards from the top too. Don't feel too bad if you miss this. Other cities have much better towers.",1017,much
1018,362,4342,"Our group of 4 walked from Myeongdong to the cable car station at Namsan Hill. Took us 25minutes. The queue for the cable car was relatively short, about 10 minutes as it was a Tuesday evening. Once out of the cable car, you still need to walk up many steps to get to the Seoul tower. There are interesting spots for photography. You have to pay a fee to get up to the observation deck. The night view was lovely. The lighted bridges along the Han River were specially awesome. The quip was that we couldn't take photos as the light from the shop in the tower casted too much reflection on the glass. You can send a postcard back home from there as the shop sells stamps, cards and has a post box! Overall, it was a memorable and fun visit.",1018,much
1019,363,4349,"I feel like it's worth it. It IS expensive, though. I forget exactly how much, but around 20-30 won per person. But it's beautiful and if you can afford it, I would go.",1019,much
1020,364,4360,"I really don't get the appeal of this place...yes, sure, the view is nice from the top, but the cable cars were terribly full and so was the location...there were just too many people to really immerse yourself in the experience. The tower itself is simply a tower which lights up in different colours, it's no architectural masterpiece. If you plan on walking up to the tower be prepared for a very steep ascent with many steps, so bring plenty of water. It's quite a hike to the top, but great exercise. I'd much rather go to one of the city's amazing art exhibitions than see this overcrowded attraction.",1020,much
1021,365,4378,"Tower is pricier than we expected, and it was surprisingly poor visibility at the top. We thought views were equally as nice from Namsan park.  If you decide to go up,sunset is a beautiful it popular time - get there much earlier than you think is necessary, especially if by cable car ad the line backs up quickly.  Best to take the bus to the top, which runs frequently straight to the top since taxis can't go up. Bus stops running earlier though, so plan to walk or take cable car back down mountain if you'll be there later than 9.",1021,much

My friend and I took a bus from the station, I forgot the name already, and left the bus at the N-tower station. It is an up-hill street which you have to walk till you reach the tower.  I did not enjoy the view that much but the atmosphere was impressive. Families, couples and friends were enjoying their moment together at the tower.  So, I just fall in love with the atmosphere not the tower itself. But such a good place to go indeed.",1022,much
1023,367,4389,"The Seoul Tower in Namsam park really does offer amazing views of the city. I didn't actually go up thought because you can get great views from the base, but Seoul was surprisingly a little smoggy.  The reason I don't give it a full 5 stars is because its very touristy, and there are much nicer places to get beautiful views of the city, of course they may require a bit of hiking, but I think its worth it.",1023,much
1024,368,4392,I went two time nothin the morning and the view is great although I think the night scene on the top of the hill if Nam San should be very good too. Both taking cable car and bus are convenient to coming up but I felt taking bus is better for elderly and not much slop needed for going up to station,1024,much
1025,369,4405,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much as there is so many of these views and towers around the world. A friend of mine took me there in the evening and after a while of waiting to get up, the most spectacular view I've ever had in my life appeared. Seoul is an incredible metropolis and the experience of seeing all those lights from the top felt almost incredible. I think I will have this picture in front of my eyes forever! :)",1025,much
1026,370,4410,"You must not visit at night time, otherwise you will not be able to see the view as the glass reflects the interior light. So please visit during the day for a greater experience.  But still it has a great view however I was not able to enjoy much because the windows reflect and there were a lot tourists in a small area.",1026,much
1027,371,4411,"I booked a tour to do this so the bus drove us up to a certain point and we walked the other half up. The hill is very steep. You will get a great workout. I do not recommend doing this when it is extremely warm in Korea as the humidity is very high and if you not accustomed to it could cause you great harm.  I was looking forward to seeing the N. Seoul Tower from the minute of booking my trip to Seoul. I booked a nite trip with Koridoor (we stopped at other locations as well as the N.Seoul Tower). The elevator ride up was great. I LOVED the view from up there however trying to take photos were hard because of the glare off the glass so that ruined it for me because I couldn't get the great shots that I wanted to get. If taking pictures really isn't at the top of your list then YES, it is a must see other than that go in the day time and the glares from the indoor lights may not affect your pictures as much as the night time views.  Before going up on the tower there is some areas to sit around and some shops to purchase food/snacks such as Coldstone. They also have the love lock area. You can purchase a lock from inside the gift store and put a lock on there. The view from there reminds of looking out over any city at night. It was great but nothing like looking at it from the Tower itself.",1027,much
1028,372,4414,Great night scene and worth checking out if you are in Seoul. Great view but depends on the level of clouds / smog how much you can see.,1028,much
1029,373,4415,I've been to seoul tower 4 times now and each time I love it more and more! The views from seoul tower are amazing! Every visitor we've had we take to seoul tower and they love it just as much as we do! This last time we went we did the love lock and it was so fun to lock our love in seoul! They have many great restaurants and souvenir shops up there as well!,1029,much
1030,374,4435,"Everyone said n Seoul tower is a must-go spot in Seoul. However, when I got there, I felt it was just okay, especially the view from the tower. It is true that I could see the whole city from the tower, but there is seriously nothing much to see. Probably that was because I didn't visit at the right time. And the visit was quite short because the tower is not big either. But the view under the tower is pretty cool. I love the scenery under the tower a lot. And you can breath the fresh air there.",1030,much
1031,375,4437,"Went during the spring, and was carrying high hopes (as many reviewers stated it is beautiful) that it may surprise me to capture its beauty. But was very disappointed, it was concealed and couldnt view much. We queued for more than 3hrs plus just to go up to the tower to find disappointments. (imo) not worth :)",1031,much
1032,376,4449,It was easy to go to the Tower. Food was available. And the view was grand. I am senior so I really didnt like much walking.,1032,much
1033,377,4452,"Checked out the Tower on June 24th, 2015. Very easy to access using one of the tour buses. Its about 1300 won or $1.25 USD. Although pic a day that is clear, when we stayed forecast was Haze everyday but we went regardless. Its obviously a great view being up so high, once at the top of the there are plenty of picture opportunities, there also decent pictures to be taken at the base of the tower. Also the guys washroom is great because the urinals have the most amazing view you've ever had while reliving yourself. We went on a weekday i think its slightly cheaper than the weekend but really our currency is valued much higher than theirs so most everything is relatively inexpensive. There is also a tram that can take you up and down, we decided to take it down and it was an ok view, 6000 won one way per person.",1033,much
1034,378,4454,"I went with my mum on a cold night. Fog was everywhere, but decided to take the risk and head up. Caught the cable car to the tower. Only a 15 minute walk from our hotel (Nine Tree in Myeongdong). We waited about an hour for the fog to dissappear, then paid to go up. Again, waited a while inside for the fog to go. Only a restaurant and a few coffee bars inside. Not much else to do inside other than the gift shop. Saw a review on TripAdvisor that said the best view was from the ladies toilets. Strange thing to say, but so true !! The view from outside was just as impressive. The amount of love padlocks there was overwhelming; (being a k-drama fan made being there even more special!). The view of Seoul was stunning, and worth the cold wait !",1034,much
1035,379,4464,"I've been here once before so I knew what to expect. But I didn't get that. Maybe their budget was cut, or maybe it was MERS to blame, but...  The exhibition, one of those live art deals where you can be a part of the art, was quite lame. I guess it was exactly as described but the atmosphere was empty and there's just not much excitement to have when you can really only do the pose they show you, nothing unique about your experience.  Then there's a SECOND hall, which looked totally devoid of people and I can see why. One is enough.  Going up to the observatory and you get the good views. I've been up enough buildings to know this is your bog standard deal. I actually found the 63 building view to be far superior, because you're closer to stuff for viewing, not up a mountain. the 63 building is in a place where you can see all the traffic and detail, and it's such an unpopular tourist attraction nowadays it takes no time and you get to see all round. So maybe check that out instead.  When I left, I expected the scheduled lights display on the Seoul Tower, which, when I was there a few years back came with music and 3d laser stuff and animations on the floor. This time, I got what seemed to be 3 minutes of silent advertisement on the tower, and nothing else. What an incredible disappointment. I was building up to that moment the whole time. I can only hope it was a one-off thing due to MERS.  Getting back down is hugely inconvenient since there are no taxis or buses, so you have to get this weird elevator down a side cliff, onto the road and walk 15 minutes or so to the subway. And there were no directions or instructions on how to do that; I had to ask a car park ticket officer.",1035,much
1036,380,4512,"Absolutely love this hike with the kids (4 & 6 yr olds). We started off at the crossroads by Hilton Millennium Hotel and hiked up the stairs. The kids enjoyed themselves and the scenary. My husband who is not fit at all, didn't soo much mind the hike as well. Granted the air quality wasn't so great that day but it was good quality time. I've jogged up the never ending road a few times for a good cardio workout but if you're looking for a good leisurely hike to enjoy with the family highly recommend it.  Getting to the actual tower is a disappointment. Once at the top we couldn't really see much past the US Army base at the foot of the hill because the pollution was bad. We weren't too happy about the condition of the tourist area...looks like the cleaning crew from the night didn't do anything as trash was all over the place. It seemed very dirty in the seated viewing area. We were there at 8am, so perhaps they only do cleaning later in the morning...but for a place that attracts a lot of tourists highly recommend they have it presentable all the time.  Would have given it high rating if it was cleaner. So i'm giving it only very good rating for only the actual hike.",1036,much
1037,381,4531,"If you like to have a view of Seoul in overall, you might like this place. Remember to check the weather forecast to avoid rainy day. There's love bridge alike section where people hang their locks on it for wish. My advise is, bring your own lock because it might be costly to purchase there. Go to the observatory tower only your travel budget allow because there's nothing much fun except that you can view the scenery in higher position. It is recommended to go there in the evening before the sun goes down, then you can view the scenery of Seoul in day and night time. However, it will be crowded there at that time because many people prefer that moment of time too.",1037,much
1038,382,4547,We went probably on the wrong day. Saturday evening there were far too many people. Buying the tickets took over 45 minutes and helpfully the lady at the counter told us that the trip to the tower would take another 90 minutes of waiting. And there are not much places to wait! About 2 hours later we were called to board the lift to the observation deck on the top floor. By this time it had started raining and the view was hindered by the water drops on the glass panes of the observatory. So not sure if it was worth the wait.,1038,much
1039,383,4563,"the view was just okay, so dont expect too much. I spend most of my time choosing and writing postcards n send to my friends. Plus point: You can post ur postcards just in the tower. So lovely!",1039,much
1040,384,4572,"Wow! This is a must to do adventure while visiting Seoul. I would recommend that you take the public transportation (bus) and plan about 4 hours (includes the bus trip) for your trip to the tower. It was definitely more interesting than I thought it would be to see how densely populated and the number of high rise apartment and office buildings make up Seoul and with almost every flat piece of land having a high rise on it. I am glad I arrived early in the day (9:45am) as many more people were arriving when I left. This is great way to get your bearings and understand the layout of Seoul. Also important for you to know that they take everyones picture before you step in the elevators and sell them to you at the top at the observation deck. The park like setting on the walk up the hill is very nice. I was also surprised to see the many love locks connected to the fences and other areas at this site. This was made popular by a Korean soap opera and considered very romantic thing to do...which I agree is.  Tips -go early -bring a camera -bring two locks; one for you and your loved one, to add to the many already there...very romantic -purchase the ticket with the popcorn/drink --best deal -plan to eat lunch in downtown Seoul as the food choices are much better",1040,much
1041,385,4576,"The weather was not so good and it was little cold BUT Seoul Tower is definately worth a visit. So much beauty up there, the view was great and we stopped by for a nice Long Island Ice tea and some burgers at the restaurants up on the mountain. Excellent attraction and well worth the visit",1041,much
1042,386,4579,"We didn't go up as it was very expensive and there was a set of stairs up a hill pretty much next to the tower which offered a very similar view for free. I would also say it is not the worth the trip to see just the tower, there are a few parks and recreational rooms (karoake, pc rooms, bars etc. ) nearby to make going to this part of Seoul worth it.",1042,much
1043,387,4596,I liked the visiting of the Tower very much. The way to it was spectacular. You can walk and relax. Once there you can enjoy the fontain which breezes you with almost invisible drops - lovely feeling. Than there is good choice of restaurants or bistros to eat. The tower itself is very difficult to observe if you are staying just underneath. And of course the funicular experience added a very nice atmosphere to that relaxed visit.,1043,much
1044,388,4602,"During most of my trip to Korea, the sky was very smoggy or overcast looking. So we didn't really have much choice of when we went. So all I can say is that on an overcast kinda day, I would just walk around the grounds and maybe do all the FREE things. Going all the way up to the top was nice, but we didn't really get a good view. After we got back down, we realized there was a place for us to walk up to (the deck with all the love locks) and that provided the same kinda of view from up top considering the condition of the sky. So we kinda regretted even paying.",1044,much
1045,389,4607,"Got lost trying to get here the first time (by bus) and gave up, but found it much easier the second time on the metro. The walk up is nice and the views are great if it's a clear day but no point with smog/haze. Worth a trip once to see it.",1045,much
1046,390,4608,"Walked to the top, but might want to take the cable car. the view is nice, and could be great but so much haze, distance you can see if very limited. I didn't bother going up the tower because of this (same view from there as the base given this). Several eateries at the base, and gift shop. As a couple, you can leave a love lock to in numerous areas as part of eternal love - a romantic thing to do. Would rate attraction much high had their not been so much smog. At night might be better? But if at day, pick a clear day (or windy so it blows the smog off).",1046,much

The Tower it self is quite beautiful, yet there are much more romance per se, which you ought to find out, about the Locks hanging on the rails. Couple used to lock the lock together, then throwing the locks down the deck, immortalizing the love relationship for eternity, long while ago this activity was a famous attraction. Now, I think it's prohibited.  Inside the tower, there are some Museums you can totally check it out.",1048,much
1049,393,4629,"The weather was cloudy when we took a cable car ride up to the tower. The views were not as beautiful as I expected. We got there at the wrong time. If you want to enjoy the most beautiful views of Seoul, you should go to the tower when the sky is clear. There was a layer of dust on the glass. The view would have been much better if the glass was sparkling clean.  Would you like to leave a love message there? You could firstly buy a love message tile, write you message on it and stick it on the love message block. Some visitors even stuck photos on the tiles. There are clear instructions which teach you how to do it.",1049,much

1051,395,4652,"This is one of the must see attractions in Seoul. I went in the afternoon but despite being a smoggy day, the views were spectacular. I decided to take a taxi to the CBD but walked to the tower, being an avid walker, and toured much of the surrounding area which also had some other fascinating attractions. Price was what you would expect and food was reasonable as well. I had a coffee at the top while taking in the great views of the city.",1051,much
1052,396,4655,"To save yourself some troubles...There are buses that travel up to Seoul Tower at Myeongdong Station. I made the mistake of taking a taxi and I am pretty sure that cabby screwed me over because I was a foreigner. Let's just say on our departure I had some choice words with the other cabbies that tried to charge a set fee of ‚Ç©20,000 but we found out that Myeongdong Station was literally down the hill from the Lift Cars by walking so duckies saved.  I suggest going at night because the view of Seoul is breath taking. It is amazing to see how much Seoul changed from my time as a kid in the '80s until now. I wish the Army would allow me to stay longer but unfortunately that is not an option.  Check out the Bear Museum inside. I know the kids will get a kick out of it and don't forget the skydeck. Been here once in the day and night so the block has been checked off.",1052,much
1053,397,4657,"The tower itself doesn't give me breathtaking view, it's quite normal view from the top. but still good for you who like to take a seat and take a high view over the city. What tick my curiosity is the ""Love Lock"" below the tower, many couple comes here to buy a lock, write your wish with your couple, and lock it together. It's like a lucky charm and simbolic of eternal love, Simlar to the one in the bridge where we can find in some of the places in the world. Well, not much to say, but still it's a great place to go when you have some spare time with your couple or family. :D",1053,much

The good news is that for 6300 won, you can take the cable car to the top, almost.  If you choose the stairs, athletic or hiking shoes are suggested although I did see some Asian women climbing the stairs with 4 inch heels. I also saw one man in his upper 80's making the climb.  The pollution in Seoul isn't publicised as much as some other Asian venues but is worth considering, although some great views are available, a bad pollution day makes short range photography manageable but city view shots may be entirely obscured.  There are multiple restaurants, grab joints, beverages, trinket shops, and a view from the top of the tower available but it was too polluted when I visited to merit going up the tower and there are 360 degree views available from the plaza at the base of the tower.",1054,much

Great view on top of it, make sure the weather is clear. Yes it's very cold during winter.  You can have your Lunch or Dinner there, there's a Burger bar and some casual food court. Ice-cream place and an official Teddy Bear korea store.  The ticketing is easy, very straight forward and so far their english is ok and no problem buying tickets.  Once arrived to N Seoul Tower up the hill by cable car (Takes 5min or so, very quick and easy) Like in KDrama, lots of Padlocks with love messages which you wouldn't spend much time if you're solo or with your family. Vending machines for drinks and hot drinks.  There's an Alive Museum which you can when you go to Insadong or Insadong's Samzigil.  To conclude, It won't cost too much to pay a visit to this unique and must go place, yes it will not take you too long to come back down since there's nothing much to do unless you plan to have a good date there then it's perfect, chill and nice atmosphere.

1059,403,4715,"Unlike some of the reviews here, we did not encounter any crowd at all. Maybe it was coz it was a freezing -5 deg that day. Or that a harsh wind was blowing. Or that it was 11am in the morning. Whatever the reason, there was hardly anyone waiting for the cable car or the Namsan elevator. However, the cable car is overpriced, the entrance to the top of the tower is overpriced, the shops are overpriced. Nothing very interesting about this place. There's this whole lot of weird locks around the area and they sell cheapo locks at such horrendous prices I wonder why in the world would anyone buy them! I suggest going for a hike at Mt Bugkaksan and the view and fresh air there is so much more worth it than fighting to take pix with pushing and shoving rude nationals from you-know-where. Totally not worth the time, money and effort to go there",1059,much
1060,404,4727,We went to N Seoul tower in September at night. The area is very beautiful (the love locks and everything) but I don't recommend going up as it is so so to me. It's just another viewing deck. It's not very big as well. If you are into that kind of thing that it might be amazing to you. Tokyo Tower is much better. I'd say it's better to just stroll&sit around the area without going up. Very long line for the cable car but it's very quick.,1060,much
1061,405,4730,"I was told that it's better to visit the tower at night to view the night scenery and I wasn't disappointed. The Christmasy atmosphere was enhanced when it suddenly snowed. There was a steep climb on a slope and it was quite tiring for someone who does not exercise much. Reaching the top of the tower in an elevator within 26 seconds, there isn't much to do up there except view the night scene and visit the souvenir shop.",1061,much
1062,406,4749,"The tower can be planned as part of your visit if you have covered most of the places in Seoul since apart from the view from top there is nothing much. Since the top of the tower is closed with glass enclosure (unlike in say, Eiffel tower ) you feel a bit disconnected from the view.  To reach the tower you will have to walk around half KM from nearest bus stop and metro.  You can either walk all the way to the top, which can be bit taxing. Or take the option that I took, of taking cable car from mid way of the hill to the tower.  Do note that cable car entry may become crowded and will require you to wait for getting your turn.  Once in the tower complex you need to collect ticket for going to top of the tower in lift. View from is great, though you get a feeling that they have tried a bit to replicate Eiffel tower.  Best would be to visit in evening so that you can view the town before sun set and after dark.",1062,much
1063,407,4773,"Seoul N Tower has a great view of the old city center if the weather is clear like in Autumn. The tower is already located on a mountain. Hence, there's no need to go up to the top of the tower to see any better view since it is pretty much the same on the ground level. Lovers' lockers are crazy all around the safety barriers. It used to be more beautiful, but it became too much of it everywhere. Nothing much unless you are so romantic to add yours.  I personally recommend everyone to take a cable to go up because only cable cars, yellow public shuttles and climbing are possible. Private cars and cabs are not allowed in the mountain. When you go back to the city, I recommend to walk down as it is quite easy walk for about an hour and has a good view point on the way. Personally, I'd say night view seems way better than day one.",1063,much

Though you can always purchase them at the sourvenirs shop but at an escalated price. We spent around 2hrs on top and really enjoyed the nice scenery and the fresh air. There are a few eateries and cafes so no worries about where to get drinks and food. I must say that this place is a must go when you're in Seoul. Furthermore after you're done, you can always make your way to Insadong (shopping for more sourvenirs and food) which is like 10 - 15mins walk.",1064,much

The tower and observation deck are at the top of a hill in the middle of the city. You can climb the hill by car, using the stairs and enjoy the greenery. My favorite way: the cable car. At the top, you have many options: cafes, a museum, souvenir shops, a wall where couples put padlocks with their names or any promise, and much more. It is definitely a romantic place but has a lot to offer if you come with family or alone. There is a good restaurant up in the tower, serving French and international cuisine, that I personally recommend, the food is up to par and the views are great. It is an excellent and romantic option for a dinner with that special someone.",1067,much

So I ended up hiking the 3km trail to the top in the middle of July - if you do this make sure you bring lots of water as it is both hot and humid!  The hike itself was really nice, and there were many different flowers and trees bordering the trail. Unfortunately, the view wasn't so spectacular since it was so humid and foggy the day that I went.  At the top, they definitely play up the love theme with heart flower arrangements, the chance to buy lover's locks (if you didn't bring your own) and attach it to the lock trees, and the benches are slanted inwards so that you sit closer to your loved one. I went to the restaurant on the main floor which was a bit pricey (also decided going up wasn't worth the $$ since you already can see out at the main level).  I think that other times during the year (Spring or Fall when it isn't so muggy) the view would be much nicer, or even at night when the tower is lit up. Regardless though, it still was an enjoyable attraction that CAN be free if you hike to the top and forego the extra lift to the top.",1068,much

I am wary of city towers because of the crowds but N Seoul was not too busy when I got there and maybe better organized than many similar structures. The view was stunning, but I actually enjoyed the fun atmosphere with people taking selfies, just hanging out or ogling the famous love padlocks area below. It is a popular stop for most Seoul visitors with good reason. On a sunny day photos do come out very well. The food options here are not great but serviceable enough with burgers and fast food. The souvenir shops are nice and service efficient. The ride up Namsan was quite good. I appreciated the fact that Seoul is still pretty much a hilly kind of city, and you are never too far from nature and lots of greenery. N Seoul Tower and Namsan can be a pleasant change of pace from the furious shopping most do when visiting the city.",1070,much
1071,415,4848,"The Seoul Tower is located on the South Mountain, and supposedly you could command a spectacular view of the Seoul skyline. The reality, however; left much to be desired.  1. the line: there was a huge line to buy tickets, and to wait for the lift, and again to come back down the mountain, mostly by local tourists and chinese tourists who come as groups or individually. a wildly popular korean drama had some scenes here, so i suppose that's the main reason for the upsurge in popularity. i came here with my girlfriend late at night, around 9PM (the lifts close at ten), hoping to avoid the crowds, but still managed to wait for over an hour all together to go up and come down. We spent no more than 15 min on the top.  2. the prices were expensive, you pay for the cable car, as well as the elevator in the tower, which is only 200 something meters, furthermore, the Seoul skyline isn't all that attractive to be honest, don't get me wrong, i love the city's youthful energy and friendly people, its just that as a city, it is nowhere near NYC, HK, Shanghai, or Paris in terms of grandeur or overall aesthetic effect on the eye. For me, it was really just a bunch of high rises in the distance and tourists and souvenir stalls next to me. So unfortunately, I was left rather disappointed by the visit.",1071,much
1072,416,4849,"(Arrival) You have to stay calm because of the crowd. I went in the evening, so did many others. The prospect of viewing Seoul's night lights seem enticing. I faced about an hour's wait to go into the lift to bring the visitors up the observatory. I don't mind the wait, but there were not enough seats or rest areas for people who were waiting. Some, just made themselves comfortable on the floor. For me, i found an air con draft and stood at the same spot for almost 1 hour. Note: If you are coming by bus, there is a steep hill for you to conquer, so advisable to have comfortable walking shoes on.  (Wait is over.. or is it...) The lift ride simulated, somewhat like a rocket taking off, with effects and all. Frankly, I din enjoy it that much because we were all packed like sardines in the lift. SO instead of going ""wow.. look at the cool effects on the ceiling of the lift.."".. I was hoping the lift ride will end ASAP.  (View from the top) The view from the observatory was great. Crowds get into your face sometimes. Some will hog the glass panels and rest themselves at the panels / selfies etc. so STAY CALM.. and wait or walk around before coming back. They have the signs that will point in the direction of you hometown, stating the distance you are away from home. There is a mailbox at the souvenir shop. Apparently, it's the 'highest' postbox or something. Many people were trying to send postcards (purchased from the shop) back home to their loved ones. Do have a pen with you if you intend on doing so.  (Final comments) Interesting experience, but my wait and travel is much longer than the time i spend there. Nice scenery but I won't be going back if i return to Seoul.",1072,much

1074,418,4873,"The tower is extremely busy. We queued for about 15 minutes to get the lift. There was a bit of jostling from some Koreans who thought it was fine to shove in as well.  Once up at the top, via a very speedy lift, we were treated to good views over Seoul. It was a clear day with no smog over the city. Unfortunately, the top is very busy a d many visitors smear their hands over the windows meaning you cannot really get good shots of the cityscape. Also, because of the huge footfall there are no comfy chairs to sit and relax up there.  The floor just below the top is less busy and for the men you can pee with a view. On this floor there is more information on the windows as to what you are looking at but again the windows are dirty. On this floor there is a coffee shop but the queue for the lift winds its way through the seating area.  We had good views but the huge number of people and dirty windows meant you couldn't really appreciate the cityscape as much as you would want. It costs 9,000 won per adult to visit. We walked up through the nature trails behind the tower. They are not clearly narked but if you just head in the direction of the tower you'll be fine. There were only a handful of people here.

The second I went was around Chuseok September 2012. A bit quieter since it was around the holidays, but they had traditional crafts and such. The third time I went was January 2013. It was freeezing, but there was so much to do! There was jump roping, traditional games, street artists, bands...it was amazing.  If you're in Seoul you have to come to N Seoul Tower.

I‚Äôd read about the locks in my guidebook but it simply described the sight as being ‚Äòtrees‚Äô covered with padlocks which symbolise eternal love. I knew to expect a few of these trees, but much to my surprise, I was greeted with an entire kaleidoscopic fence full of padlocks, key rings, phone cases, tags, hearts and toys - there was such an array of dazzling paraphernalia attached to the railings!  I spent nearly an hour taking in the sight before me, reading through the many names & notes appearing on the locks. Some of the messages were concise & to the point; others had a lifetime of thought & emotion put into them; all amounted to an astonishing display of collective happiness in the form of symbolic expression.  As for the view from the top of the tower? Well, it was pretty neat, but a little too smoggy to be considered spectacular. The monochrome picture from the heavens didn‚Äôt quite match the vividity of the scene below.  Promise me you visit the love locks if you ever find yourself at N Seoul Tower!  Perhaps you can even fasten one to the fence yourself?",1081,much

You may also take a bus or cable car to go there.  If you take a bus, you will have to walk uphill bout 10 minutes (depends). Other attractions nearby, such as Alive Museum and famous love-locks place are worth visiting if you have extra time to spend. You'll have to buy the ticket before proceeds to observation deck.  Basic costs: Heart love-lock set: KRW12000 (split two with my friend so KRW6000 each) Seoul morning tour bus: KRW10000 (you may hop in and off at most Seoul's attractions until 7 pm) Admission ticket for adult: approx. KRW15000 (observatory deck + Alive Museum) Sending postcard from observation deck: approx. KRW1000++ with stamp  It's such a nice place for photo sessions (despite it was really windy when we went there). The love-lock thing is so fun to do, and the view of Seoul from observation deck is just mesmerizing. I heard it is much fun at night, but I prefer morning as the view is clearer. Nothing to brag bout Alive Museum, just skip it if you dislike taking pictures. You need to come here if you're in Seoul, the air, the nature is amazing!",1082,much

The prices are also outrageous. This is to be expected, considering as how touristy it is, but it's not worth it.  You will pay about $9 per person just to go up the tower. Of course, you have to get to the tower first, which can vary in price and time, depending on if you take a bus, the (expensive) lift system or walk the whole way (not recommended unless you have a lot of time in Seoul). The food at the top is also expensive, so eat in advance, or bring snacks during your time at the tower.  I recommend taking a hike on one of the mountains in Seoul instead. It is a great way to get some exercise, spend some time with your friends or family, and the view is much better. Trust me. You will appreciate the scenery much more on the mountains. Bring a lunch, join the Korean locals, and make a day of it. You will not regret it.",1083,much

We were fortunate to see Seoul during daylight on the way up and then stuck around until sundown to go back down - I would recommend doing the same but be prepared for a crowd.

Apparently those who went up hang around (with the steep price, I can understand why) and it was hard to properly enjoy the view.

It really depends when you go. I took the cable car at night around 8pm, i didn't need to wait that long. I think maybe around 10~15mins time. The cable car is a bit pricey i thought but its an experience and most tourist will never know until they took it. Alternatively, you can take the bus there at a much lower cost.  I think one of the attractions was the safe/lock thing where many couples, friends and family (me included) purchased a lock and lock there. Of course some would say its not worth it and stuff like that but what I can tell you is that it really depends what your looking for. For me, i do it as an experience and memory so i think its worth it. Even if you don't purchase a lock and lock it there, its an experience to see how many people visited Seoul.

Whilst the tower was ok, would recommend the pancakes from the base level restaurant on the outer (and add a milkshake from the burger restaurant). Food was clearly the highlight of the trip!!!

1106,450,5147,"The Teddy Bear Museum inside the Tower is a lot of fun, although the scale is not as big as the famous one in Jeju. The 'robotic' teddy bears are used to portray the histories and activities of Korea. Overall, it's an enjoyable experience for both children and adults.

1113,457,5228,"Often in a new city, I do take the effort to visit towers or tall buildings with observation decks given my line of work. I don't often enjoy them given how most of these visits are often crammed full with tourists, usually over-priced, and due to the nature of having to move vertically - you have to endure packed elevators on top of the lines. Still, I do make the effort if I have the time and there are the occasional highlights - plus some cities really look so much better from up high.  The N Seoul Tower in Seoul, South Korea is definitely one of the pluses in my book. Although in terms of infrastructure there really isn't anything remarkably different about the N Seoul Tower, I definitely enjoyed my visit there and count it as among the highlights of my week long Seoul adventure.  One of the major attractions of the N Seoul Tower is its location atop the scenic Namsan mountain in the centre of the city. The tower is fringed by nature and the absence of cars gives the space a certain serenity that's marred only by the shuttle buses that ply the route up. It's definitely worthwhile making your way here just to enjoy the view from the base of the tower, soaking in nature's splendour and enjoying an ice cream from one of the many retailers here. I was here in Spring so the weather was crisp, cool and really almost perfect.  The N Seoul Tower has a unique positioning as the place for love with many love-smitten folks hanging padlocks declaring their everlasting bonds on structures and fences at the base. It makes for some pretty ornaments (albeit expensive ones) but really, this notion of public testaments of love seems pretty tacky. Plus the whole idea of a padlock reminds me more of a prison than love but hey, that's my opinion entirely.  The good thing about the 'love connection' here at the tower is that it lends the whole space a whole lot more charm and appeal. And the management of the place obviously knows this and uses this to their benefit well what with couple benches and love-themed souvenirs. Towers and tall buildings can be sterile and industrial so this lovey-dovey angle is really a compelling angle to have.  As compelling as the site is, the star of course is the tower itself. The N Seoul Tower has a few observatory levels including two restaurants. I only did the views so can't comment on the dining options up high. Tickets are not as pricy as some other towers starting at around RM24 (USD8) which is really pretty decent. There's a combo ticket option which gives you entry to the Teddy Bear Museum also located onsite which I highly recommend.  The tower visit itself is fairly generic. You have a fancy elevator ride up that's decked out with multimedia (this time on the elevator roof). The observatory levels offer great views and there are retail outlets too offering gifts and snacks. One nice addition is the opportunity to send a postcard overseas from the little 'postal office' there. I also liked how they indicated the distance to other major Asian cities on the glass windows based on the direction you are facing. I can see many tourists looking for 'home' and I did too.  So if you ever find yourself in Seoul, do check out the N Seoul Tower. If you do a relaxed visit with a meal, the Teddy Bear Museum and a walk around the site thrown in, it's a good half day at least. Check out the main website for access information and hours and I've heard that the night view is stunning. Definitely a site I will recommend.",1113,much
1114,458,5238,"I went there at night via cable car, which I recommend as the ascent can be quite fun, and you slowly get a wider and wider view of Seoul as you go up. It's good enough for you to stay at the base of the tower, and the open air environment feels nice at night. Nothing much to do though, aside from eating or looking at the view.  The top of the tower is a bit so-so. It's not that significantly higher imo. You don't get to feel the height either as there are no glass floors for you to look down. The buildings are indistinguishable at night so you can't identify the popular landmarks.",1114,much
1115,459,5241,"N Seoul Tower is a television located in Namsan Mountain therefore it actual height is much higher than 236m of the tower itself. N tower is a famous place for visitor as well as Korean people where you can view the whole Seoul city. I got there 2 times, One time in the morning and see many people doing exercise by climming up the mountain to the tower, in which many old people (amazing). It is also a good place for Korean athletics train their strength. Another time visit the place was in evening after wandering in MyongDong. The tower is beautiful at night. There are many beautiful Korean and Japanese couples get there to take pictures and lock their love in the lock tree. I've got one there, and so far it works. So dont fogert the lock if you have chance to visit this place.",1115,much
1116,460,5244,"Our first stop in Seoul. The cable car ride is recommended as you can see the whole of Seoul. The hike up to the tower was scenic as well. Since I came from USA and it was daytime (no lights), the tower itself did not amaze me. The teddy bear museum was fun for my 4yr old girl although there wasn't much activity to amuse me. The Korean culture as seen on the tower interested me. They have trees with padlocks and padlocks on the perimeters of the tower. What we enjoyed the most was when we were about to leave the area, there was a traditional costume wearing free of charge and my husband went for it. A good start for a whole day city tour!",1116,much
1117,461,5250,"You have to be extremely determined to get to the top of this tower. There‚Äôs no quick and easy way. A city tour bus stops here ‚Äì the hop on hop off type. Local buses venture up, and my guide book says that taxis carrying foreign tourists can drive up. There‚Äôs also a cable car but that‚Äôs no quick and easy trip either. The base of the cable car has no nearby metro and it‚Äôs a climb just to get there. On my way down I did see some shuttle buses but as a tourist, good look with finding out where they go to. There‚Äôs a rail car which covers part of the way from the base station to the street level.  Anyway, back to the tower. When you get off your bus, you‚Äôre still faced with a steep climb to the tower. Fatties beware. You buy your ticket then you look round for signs where to go and see none, so naturally you head to the base of the tower and inside you do a complete circuit past numerous cafes etc and see a lift. Then you‚Äôre told that this is not the lift up. The man points to a public phone across a pathway outside and a small alleyway behind it. You look for the signs and still see none. Not any in English anyway. The pathway leads you in to a building with various entertainments and you still find yourself looking around and having to ask where the lift is. Eventually, at some point in your life, you get to the top of the tower.  The view is ok. During my 9 day stay I went up on what was probably the clearest sunniest day and it was still very hazy. There were no distant views to be enjoyed. As always, I venture up these towers mid to late afternoon for daytime photos and stay until after dark for night shots. Seoul didn‚Äôt really come to life and light up very much. Not like say Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai and Sydney. It was disappointing. From a photographic point of view, the cleanliness of the windows was good.  Now the descent. I chose to use the cable car. By the time you‚Äôve walked down the multitude of steps to discover the huge queue, you‚Äôre unlikely to feel like climbing all the way back up to get a bus down. So you join the queue and during that time you‚Äôre expecting to come across a ticket booth, or pay on entry thing. Not quite. By the time you get to a point close to boarding you see that almost everybody has already got a ticket by some means, Your option is to exit the queue and buy a ticket form the vending machine at point of boarding. While you are trying to work out how to use the non-English machine, 50 people who were behind you are now in front and filling up that single slow-moving cable car. If you‚Äôre quick and lucky you just manage to get in that car as I did without having to wait 10 minutes for the next one.  At the base station it‚Äôs a case of wandering around and deciding on the options. You‚Äôre still fairly high up. There are steps down to street level, and as mentioned earlier, a rail car. Some of the non-English speaking tourists found a bay with shuttle buses, went to investigate, then returned to the rail car where I was, having been unable to find out which buses went where. Once you‚Äôre back on the street it‚Äôs about a 20 minute walk to a metro station. And you‚Äôre still going downhill.  So, as I said at the beginning, you have to be extremely determined to venture up this tower.",1117,much
1118,462,5261,"This is a must when visiting Seoul. There is a cable car which will take you to the top but can be very crowded. We walked the steep incline with our 3 grandsons ages 2,4,6. There could have got there much faster than we did. At the top we ate burgers which were wonderful as we sat over looking the beautiful city at night. On the way up we took many pictures thinking what a lovely city but by the time we made it to the top and ate, it was dark. My what a site! The light were worth the walk, very impressive. There was a small charge to ride up to the top of the tower but even if you choose not to do the tower it self the view is stunning from the base and the walking trail. Also at the top the store of the thousand thousands of locks was interesting. We enjoyed it very much and will visit on out next trip to Seoul.",1118,much

1120,464,5270,"Missed this attraction fm my last trip so was very determined to go this round. We were misinformed at the concierge of our hotel that this place is walkable from the hotel!! I should have stucked to my own research findings and not trust the reception. Although a short walk, getting to the cable station was a sharp steep walk. Was totally out of breath when we reached the station! The best way to get there is by taxi as it won't cost a lot. It will save you a lot of leg power. If you really want to walk, we found out too late there is a much easier way. I don't have the road names ready but I will try to give adequate directions. From Myeondong shopping are, head towards Migliore dept store and turn right on the main road. Think is is called Namsan-dong. Walk towards Shinsaegae dept store (near Namdaemun market). Before reaching Shinsaegae, turn left (a big road so you can't miss it). Walk on for 5 minutes (uphill) and you will come to a lift (special lift just to bring passengers up to Namsan Cable car station. It is free and is so easy rather than walking uphill like what we did...at the cable car station, a return ticket is KRW8,000 per pax. Need a 10 min wait for each cable car to arrive. It was worth the wait as we got down at the foot of N-Seoul Tower. Plenty of activities as there were some shows going on, changing of guards? Can take pictures with the guards. After a few flight of steps, you will be at the big courtyard where you can buy tickets up to the observatory deck or go into the restaurants in the tower. We wondered around the open areas and were fascinated with the many colourful locks (for sweethearts) and couple seats...you need to see this and try it out...cool. The shops on the ground floor are so pretty and captivating that we forgot all about going up the observatory deck (KRW9,000 entrance fees) and shopped there for nearly 45 minutes, choosing all the cute stuff sold there. All in all, it was worth our while albeit the tough walk.",1120,much

But you get a feel for the entire city from the above, which is quite special.  The height of the tower itself is actually much less than CN Tower. Much of the elevation comes from the mountain. There are some shops, cafes and restaurants near the tower entrance, but I would not recommend. When we went on top, Seoul was all white with snow, which was quite a sight.  After coming down from the tower, we headed to Grand Hyatt nearby (10 minutes by car), which had a very lively night scene with a fabulous lobby. I highly recommend going to the Grand Hyatt for a drink after you saw the tower.",1124,much

That was a stroke of luck as we didn't know about the bus (not mentioned in the guidebook that we had).  As we arrive at the Tower in the late afternoon, we get to see Seoul in the day and after dinner, in the night, which was fantastic. For dinner, highly recommend the HanCook korean restaurant. Although it is a bit expensive, the buffet is relatively good and you get to enjoy the views without the tour groups and crowds (it is only one floor below the main observation deck). For even better deals, purchase the observatory/Hancook combo ticket. It provides some savings than if you pay separately.  Overall, a good place to view a panorama of Seoul city, though it will depend very much on the weather when you are there.",1127,much
1128,472,5354,"Getting to the Seoul Tower is something of an adventure in itself - I had no problem following the online directions to take the subway stop and walk through the commercial district past restaurants and things and take some stairs and walk along the street to the cable car, which was an interesting trip in itself. You can also get there by bus which would be preferable if you have a problem with heights.  Once the cable car lets you off, up on the mountain, you could walk over to the tower itself or you could explore the mountain, which has a big park and an outdoor pavilion area where they were doing some kind of cultural display when I was there, and who knows what else. There are also food vendors, coffee, and other stuff like that.  So far you could do all this for free, because you can just hike up the mountain if you want, and once there you don't have to pay for anything else unless you want to experience the observation decks or the restaurant in the tower itself. We decided to go ahead and pay to go up to the observation deck, because it doesn't really cost that much and it was a weekday so it wasn't very crowded. We didn't have to wait in line for anything, and we were able to easily take advantage of the bathrooms (which have amazing views and are very clean and nice) and the coffee shop and restaurant and so on that are on the observation levels. One thing we found out is that the restaurant is on a rotating level but the observation level does not rotate, so you can't just sit there and see the entire city like I thought I was going to do.  In summary, the views are amazing and definitely worth it even on a hazy day. Yes it can get a little touristy in there, and yes the prices at the coffee shop and so on are quite high, but it is a tourist attraction after all. I considered it to be worth the price of admission. I plan on going back on a clear day if possible to eat at the rotating restaurant just so I can enjoy the view of the whole city.",1128,much

I took the bus both times, so I suppose I would try walking the foot path or cable car if i ever went again. The bus was fine. I recommend going in the late after noon when you can see the view of the city by day. You can then stay and enjoy a snack in the cafe and watch the sunset. You will be treated to an entirely different scene when you see the city light up for the evening. Go with someone who isn't in a rush, and who will appreciate the scenery with you. This is definitely worth doing once if you are in Korea for a year or more. Please be aware that there is an additional cost to go up to the viewing levels of the tower. Some friends had paid to take the cable car up to the tower grounds, but they then realized they had to by the additional cost to take the elevator up inside the tower. In my opinion, if you go all the way there, you have to go up inside the tower. The cost, whatever it was, did not seem much to me and was worth it.

The process takes a long time as it is crowded getting up the cable car and then up the elevator. Then the view from the top is (at least at night) largely obscured by the bright lights of the gift shop displays which are DIRECTLY behind all the windows. So you're essentially seeing glare, not the beautiful city lights. Big tourist trap too - lots of kitschy souvenirs and overpriced food.

You can sit on some steps/platforms they have. You can buy some expensive souvenirs and pay by weight a self fill bag of selected candies.  The sights are nice, but I personally feel some of the parks around Seoul give you a nicer view without the money grab.",1148,nothing

But Seoul ain't nothing special to see from an observatory by night. Moreover there are many light on the top floors which give reflect in many pictures... Sky restroom are not skywalk restroom but just with big windows.  And then to go down. The queue started on the floor 5F, when the elevator is on the 4F. The complete 4F floor was just a line. Never saw that !  If you wanna go, buy your ticket on the lower area, where you can access the observatory. You can at least see how is the line.

Top of the tower gives you an observation deck and above it, a rotating restaurant. The food or the price at the restaurant is nothing to boast about.

Pros 1) You get to see Seoul in one site 2) though the cable car is expensive, you can climb up the mountain to reach there 3) have cool performance in the afternoon  Cons 1) Ticket for observation deck is not worth the price. If you wish to go, i recommend you to get combo stuffs. Pay some more and grab some snacks 2) When climbing from Myeongdong, the slope is too high. If your shoes are uncomfy, just take cab or bus up there  Tips If you wish to go for observation deck, i recommend you to look for tickets online. It's nice when you go there at night or during sunset I wouldn't really recommend you to go up to the observation deck as there is nothing much to do up there. There are weekly basis performances and benches just below the tower and it is good enough to have to sight when you are climbing up the mountain.

We took the bus down the road from Exit 2, Chungmuro Station which took us up to foot of a hill. We had to hike up the steep hill to get to the base of the tower. It was very busy. The tower was full of the locks of love. It was quite an interesting sight. The ticket counter person wasn't very nice. Most people were standing around to check which was the best ticket to buy as they had couple combos etc.and she kept asking us to move ahead. We have no choice and had to choose something at the spur of the moment. She was rude. The journey up to the tower was speedy with a clip shown on the ceiling. Once up there, the view was incomparable - stunning. It didn't take long for our feet to start aching as there were so many people around and so few seats. When we were heading down, we had to wait in a long queue which made our feet ache even more. When we finally got down, we decided to take the cable car down as it is supposedly part of the tower experience. We had a very long wait as it was busy. Our aching feet didn't enjoy the wait either. There was nothing romantic about the cable car ride. We were jam packed in a cable car of at least 30 people. If i were to describe that experience, I'd say we felt like tunas/sardines in a can. I would tell future travelers to give it a miss and take the bus instead. It's cheaper and more convenient. Don't waste precious time waiting to be packed into a sardine can. When we got to the base of the cable car station, we had to wait for the bus anyway. Overall it was alright, but not the best memory we had.",1158,nothing

I probably looked so lonely to them (which was the complete opposite, mind you). I came in around 1400 and the cable car was packed. I think I waited about 40 minutes to finally be on my way to the tower. I was told it's better to see the city from the tower at night but I didn't have enough time and it was my last day in the city. There was a show in the main courtyard.  I just really wish the cheesy commercial in the elevator was not so directed at love and having a boyfriend and all that. Seriously, the mascot is a CGI bear that helps this guy get the girl he likes and they go on a date in the tower. Oh, and the barricade is filled with those heavy locks with names of couples hoping to make it forever (just like the love bridge in Paris, but guess what? that broke, haha!). Maybe I'm just your typical American single girl who's jaded in all these cheesy things but marketing should be inclusive, not alienating. There were kids there seeing the commercials - already being groomed that in life, all you need is a mate to take to Seoul Tower and nothing more.

I suggest if you are fit enough just to walk up to the top, it takes a while but is worth it. The tower itself is nice, but nothing amazing, unfortunately Seoul doesn't have a great skyline so the view from the top isn't outstanding. Some really nice cafes and restaurants are at the bottom of the tower, good place for a cheap meal. Sure it is nice, and still a decent view, but it won't blow you away.",1165,nothing

1168,33,1425,"I was not intended to go to the Seoul Tower. I just made a dinner reversation for a restaurant at 5th floor of the Tower, so I visited the Tower. Before I went there, I read many reviews of other travellers here, and they said you should be ready for long queue for the cable car. So I reached the cable car entrance amost 2 hrs in advance of my dinner booking. Out of my surprise, I did not need to queue at all, I just went there, bought the ticket, then I could go up to the entrance. I waited only for a few minutes, the cable came.  I thought that the cable car would be kind of individual cabinet, but it is not. It is a big one, no seats, able to accomodate 20-25 persons standing inside.  Cable car should be the best way to go to the Tower. I saw many people coming with big tour bus, and they needed to climb up to the hill. Anyway, after I had arrived, I saw many visitors, most of them are mainland Chinese, not very crowded, but noisy.  There are several gift shops and chain restaurants, but nothing special not buy, nor nothing good to eat here. You could take a lot of pictures with the ""love locks"" if you come with your another half.  There, you could buy the ticket to the observatory which is on the 3rd floor. I do not recommend it, though the elevator is interesting. Nothing much to see in the obvservatory. There are very few souvneirs shops, but trust me, the commodities are not interesting to buy though I was ready to, and intended to buy something.  But still, you could have a lunch / dinner at the korean restaurant.  There is also a chained coffee shop, called TWOSOME+, do not go. There is only one staff, so he is always busy and impatient. He might not be good at English, and when I ordered a drink in English, he misunderstood, and gave me another thing, I requested him to exchange, he became even more impatient and the atitudes were bad !  There is a wish pool right next to the coffee shop. I could hardly see something there. Who will throw money into such ""fake"" pool??????  After spending 1 hr on this boring 3rd floor, I went to the destination of this ride - 5th floor - N Grill (french restaurant), which was perfect in service and environment and food.  The view there is wonderful.  I recommend not to go up to this tower, unless you want to spend most time at N Grill. And if you go, it is better to be dinner time. The night view is fantastics.

Restaurants are expensive and even the souvenirs. But what we enjoyed more is the area where people leave locks spreading messages of love especially couples feeling so romantic. You'll see them seated in benches whispering sweet nothings to each other. It was cold and windy that night in September, 2013. Really a good time for couples in love. Another attraction we visited was the Teddy Bear Museum. It was awesome seeing them in all sizes, in different costumes, various themes and some, in action. You really would spend time taking photos not only of these cute bears but photos with them. It was fun. When we were about to leave, there was this light show of the tower itself.

In any event, the experience is well worth the cost of getting to the summit (free for walkers but otherwise $8 for the return cable car ride.

Now I don't really love height and the windowed elevators in towers always scare me, but geez - that's part of the show! Watching the ground slip away from you is a thrill.  Next, the observatory just didn't feel special. There wasn't a 'look-down' window so you can get the thrill of being suspended in the air. And unless I missed it, there was nothing to point out the major sites of the town.  Sorry... but I wasn't too impressed with the tower.

1174,39,1596,"Having been to Tokyo Tower, the N Seoul Tower did not give me the ""wow"" experience when I went up to admire the night scenery. It could be because there wasn't much to look out for when at the top. The view at every angle seemed the same to me. Perhaps it could be better if there was a guide pointing out the landmarks to spot when viewing from a certain part of the tower. The only prominent feature I could identify was probably the Han River.  There are also hourly light shows that will be beamed on the tower itself, starting from 8 pm. But honestly, you can skip it and head straight for the tower. It is nothing fanciful.  The place, like every tourist attraction, is full of people, and waiting time to get up to the viewing gallery can span up to 30 minutes (and that was when I visited on a weekday), so I suggest that you avoid weekends or public holidays, which in my opinion, will take even longer.  TIP: Tower admission fees are 9000 won for adults, but you can enjoy a 10% discount if you use the coupon provided when you purchase a Seoul City Pass Plus (their public transport card, but specially for foreigners) card.

The ride was smooth, but the view from the car and from the tower is nothing special. We went there in the night expecting nice views, but there is too much light which prevents us from getting a good view of the city (see picture).

I've been to many similar towers around the world, and they are all very similar to each other, with just different views. If you have not been in a tower like this, I would recommend it, however it is nothing special. It contains the usual features to try and coerce you into spending your money such as the group photos, gift shops and overpriced restaurants. The views are amazing though and I would recommend a visit if it is your first time. There is one special feature which are the locks on the fences, which are quite fun to do and look nice. The hike is also quite beautiful and great if you want to enjoy nature and fresh air. The cable car ride is also stunning and you can see amazing views. I would recommend going to the tower during the day time, where the view is clearer, whereas as night only the lights can be seen. I did go during sunset and the ride up the cable car was beautiful, and the views were absolutely amazing. This is dependent on the season, I went in winter, it was quite cold at night, and the bus rides down the mountain were limited. There are a few restaurants there, however I would not recommend them based on my personal experience. I went to the Korean buffet, and the food was not worth the price.

The queue for the cable car can be quite long, especially before sunset. Allow plenty of time for this.  Once at the top you will need to pay a fee for the tower itself. There are many of locations around the top where you can take some great shots of the city, but inside the tower itself, is where you really see Seoul for its beauty.  Buildings with a backdrop of mountains and cars which look like ants! Lots of useful information pointing to different cities around the world.  You really want to be up here when the sun is just about to go down. The views and colours are amazing so a camera is a must.

1192,57,2759,So the day that we went a family of 5 the two parents of five-year-old and two teenagers we took a taxi up to the cable car I recommend that as the best way to get to the N Tower. The cable car ride to the tower was jam-packed full so it's very hard to get your window to get good video so you might have to head your way strongly to get to the window to get some good video or pictures. The wait to get on the cable car was not very long so that was very well worth it. I think you can also walk up the hill and take all the steps to get to the in Tower which I would love to do on a nice spring or fall day not a rainy day like we went. Make sure you take a lot of padlock or some kind of lock to add to the locks at the top I forget what they're for but it's really a pretty cool it's a community or World Wide Arts peace you'll understand when you get there but take a log or Google it before you get there to know why you're taking a lot. There are several places to eat at the in Tower all ranges of prices ranging from probably 2 or 3 Bill signs 2425 Bill signs though so nothing really cheap but definitely a place to stop and eat if you want to have time it was crazy busy even on a rainy day. Once you're up in the tower they have names major cities like New York City is so many kilometers away excetera excetera which is pretty cool so you couldn't go all the way around the whole circle and take pictures with you or yourself and your family and with the cities that you've been to or the city that you're from. The little to shop up in the tower was wonderful and we thought the prices were very fair for some very unique gift ideas we opted for the little puzzle with the frame which happened to be on sale and they had multiple items on there like weekly or monthly cell so that was really. The candy store if it's still there was pretty cool also apart everything is impeccably clean and the candy is quite good although a little spendy but it's worth it. I would say if your only choice to go was during rainy weather then it absolutely still is a must go on but if you could go during clearweather then that would be the best although I'm sure that's also the busiest.,1192,nothing

I remember 3 years ago it was a relaxing walk up and down and also the tower area was quite peaceful. Somehow I have the feeling it is worsening year by year. The operator has started to renovate and offer now several floors with shops, restaurants and whatsoever. Some of them opened and just closed again. LOL. Why? Because probably not many people will spend a penny there. There are mainly interested in making selfies. That's it. And who shall buy all these things you really don't need? We went there and left every time at least 50k for tower entrance and a beer, coffee or ice cream. There were a few shops totally enough to serve visitors. And usually you climb up to have a nice few and not to drink and eat whole day long. Anyway this time is over for us spending any coin there. This year every time we visited the place it was totally over crowded. If you want to visit tower's upper floor you shall wait at least an hour or even more. Especially on the weekends. Same way down. I can be wrong but since 2015 it changed dramatically. We usually walking either up or down along the small road. I remember the time when we saw many people using the bike to go up. Time is over. Now every minute some old diesel engine is rushing uphill to unload and to come back to collect again. Some of them are driving fast and reckless. If you have kids you are mainly busy with watching them because you are afraid that something happened. I really wonder why Seoul citizens are not doing much about it. Did they gave up already? Do they like how it is? This place becomes really disgusting. It has nothing to do anymore with a nice, beautiful, quiet, green, park and place. It just became a polluted place of commerce.

This being said, the tower itself is nothing special, even rather on the dated side in comparions with many others (for example the windows are straight (and dirty) which is not ideal to take pictures).

You can also purchase souvenirs for yourself. We carried out our own lunch so dont have much idea about the food services there. After having our lunch, we visited the alive museum which was right next to the Seoul tower.

But although the crowds were not that substantial it is nothing that special - until you compare it to any of the other attractions in Seoul!

I've been 3 or 4 times and the wait has ranged from 1.5 hours to nothing. So be prepared for a bit of a wait, but you will have a great view of the city.

I feel like the ethical thing for the operators to do would be to warn visitors, instead of just taking our money only for us to come straight back down.

On the other hand, the base of the tower gives good enough views at all 360 degrees and there's restaurants and cafes to spend time there too.

1240,105,4411,"I booked a tour to do this so the bus drove us up to a certain point and we walked the other half up. The hill is very steep. You will get a great workout. I do not recommend doing this when it is extremely warm in Korea as the humidity is very high and if you not accustomed to it could cause you great harm.  I was looking forward to seeing the N. Seoul Tower from the minute of booking my trip to Seoul. I booked a nite trip with Koridoor (we stopped at other locations as well as the N.Seoul Tower). The elevator ride up was great. I LOVED the view from up there however trying to take photos were hard because of the glare off the glass so that ruined it for me because I couldn't get the great shots that I wanted to get. If taking pictures really isn't at the top of your list then YES, it is a must see other than that go in the day time and the glares from the indoor lights may not affect your pictures as much as the night time views.  Before going up on the tower there is some areas to sit around and some shops to purchase food/snacks such as Coldstone. They also have the love lock area. You can purchase a lock from inside the gift store and put a lock on there. The view from there reminds of looking out over any city at night.

It is true that I could see the whole city from the tower, but there is seriously nothing much to see. Probably that was because I didn't visit at the right time.

So we still needed to go up the tower itself (do I need to tell that by the time we were at this point, on top of the mountain, the sun had set few hours ago already). So going up the hill where the tower is is one part of the journey, and costs two elevator tickets and after that you buy the ticket to get up the tower. Here you have the same problem I find lots of sightseeing towers to have- the glasses are round and in the middle of the tower theres a souvenir shop which lights up the whole room so if you try to take a picture you end up having nothing but background light in it.. The view is nice tho, but you get almost the same view on the bottom of the tower, up on the hill, and definitely better pictures there as well.

The prices for the tower vary in function if you want to eat or not in one of the two restaurants.

The exhibition, one of those live art deals where you can be a part of the art, was quite lame. I guess it was exactly as described but the atmosphere was empty and there's just not much excitement to have when you can really only do the pose they show you, nothing unique about your experience.  Then there's a SECOND hall, which looked totally devoid of people and I can see why. One is enough.  Going up to the observatory and you get the good views. I've been up enough buildings to know this is your bog standard deal. I actually found the 63 building view to be far superior, because you're closer to stuff for viewing, not up a mountain. the 63 building is in a place where you can see all the traffic and detail, and it's such an unpopular tourist attraction nowadays it takes no time and you get to see all round. So maybe check that out instead.  When I left, I expected the scheduled lights display on the Seoul Tower, which, when I was there a few years back came with music and 3d laser stuff and animations on the floor. This time, I got what seemed to be 3 minutes of silent advertisement on the tower, and nothing else. What an incredible disappointment. I was building up to that moment the whole time. I can only hope it was a one-off thing due to MERS.  Getting back down is hugely inconvenient since there are no taxis or buses, so you have to get this weird elevator down a side cliff, onto the road and walk 15 minutes or so to the subway.

Go to the observatory tower only your travel budget allow because there's nothing much fun except that you can view the scenery in higher position.

Great view on top of it, make sure the weather is clear. Yes it's very cold during winter.  You can have your Lunch or Dinner there, there's a Burger bar and some casual food court.

To reach the tower you will have to walk around half KM from nearest bus stop and metro.  You can either walk all the way to the top, which can be bit taxing.

Once in the tower complex you need to collect ticket for going to top of the tower in lift. View from is great, though you get a feeling that they have tried a bit to replicate Eiffel tower.

1256,121,4941,The view up there is nice but there is nothing really interesting. Because from one can already see the view of the city from the foot of the tower. The deck is filled with people which makes it quite squeezy. Not really worth the 9000won for the observatory deck.,1256,nothing
1257,122,4968,Tho it is a must to place to go if you are 1st timer to Seoul but sorry to say there is really nothing interesting there unless you wanna visit the art museum (no more teddy bear museum) which is the same as trickeye museum.  Unfortunately for me there isn't much scenery for me to see as it was too foggy also there were soo many people up there where you dont really have a chance to take a good picture plus the most important area which is the edge where u see the scenery is under renovation.,1257,nothing
1258,123,5039,"Basically, there is nothing special about this place. But there is a Teddy Bear museum here and I think if you are not be able to visit Jeju Island for original Teddy Bear museum, this place is a great choice. I don't really recommend going up N Seoul Tower because there is a place which is much nicer than N Seoul Tower and it is 63 Building. Instead of N Seoul Tower, I think 63 Building has a much nicer view to see (especially night view). However, if you do have time, try to visit both places and compare it yourself.",1258,nothing
1259,124,5050,"Came here after our visit to Namsamgol Hanok Village. There were a few direct city bus from the village to Mt Namsan. From there, a manageable steep accent to the tower. I find the tickets way overpriced. There is nothing much on top and it was over-crowded and noisy. Apparently those who went up hang around (with the steep price, I can understand why) and it was hard to properly enjoy the view. I went there while the sun was setting and it was nice to see the sunset hues and then quickly turning dark (it was winter time). It was a good way to appreciate the city though ... Seoul is really huge...and the roads are all glittering with cars stuck in the jam :)",1259,nothing
1260,125,5091,"Tower located on a hilltop and you can either walk up or take cable car.  View is nothing fantastic and it was extremely crowded and noisy with a long queue from cable car, ticketing booth, getting up/down the tower and leaving the attraction.",1260,nothing
1261,126,5119,"It's just a high building in a big park.  Korean are sure know how to do Tourism, and they do good. From nothing, by putting stuff to it, they make it intro a quite interesting place to be.  A quite fine place, but won't go again.",1261,nothing
1262,127,5159,"So, this wasn't really high on my priority list of ""to see"" in Seoul but went there we did. It was a very foggy day with poor visibility so I don't know why we bothered. We took the cable ride up .... tiny cable cars btw. They pack you all in so tight that it's hard to get a good panoramic view of the city. You can also walk up the hill if you're up for the challenge and want a good work out; which would be fine with me but not when we had an 8.5 & 4 yr olds with us. The grounds surrounding the base of N Tower is beautiful and serene. That would probably the best part of the site. You could bring a picnic and come hang out here and let the kids run wild. N Tower, as it turns out, has become a bit of a lovers' destination. The place to meet with potential lover, first encounter, date, and make ever lasting promise of your undying love to each other by putting a lock marked with your names and attaching it to any free space on the railings if you can find a spot. Good luck as there have been 100,000s before you! Shops and cafes at the base of the tower caters to said lovers. Even a store selling locks if you forgot to bring your own. The place is dripping with cheese. Enough to make a cold hearted, non-romantic such as myself want to hurl. All in all nothing that interesting to see but if you just want to be outdoors, near nature, and get a good exercise, this is a nice place to come.",1262,nothing
1263,128,5192,"We were here on May 28, 2013. It was a weekday and the place wasn't crowded. We walked from the hotel to the tower, about 20 minutes, and took the elevator to the main floor to buy tickets to use the cable car. The ride is about 10 minutes to get to the base of the tower. There is a small park, various stores, a restaurant, and other novelties. The day was somewhat foggy so we opted to stay at the base. However, you can go further up the tower but need to pay yet another fee. The view from the base was OK. An hour or so walking around at this level should be enough. No issues with crowds or waiting on long lines. You can go there if you have nothing better to do in Seoul. Ask around about other places with good city views that are free.",1263,nothing
1264,129,5211,"Hard to get a day where it isn't foggy, although the view is decent, it's nothing that will leave you speechless.  Good for an hour or two, don't plan your entire day around it though.",1264,nothing
1265,130,5225,the view during the day is nothing like the evening city view. Going at the top of the tower with a date in the evening overviewing the city lighted is really something.,1265,nothing
1266,131,5299,The uphill to the tower will be really tiring! the tower itself is unique but up inside the tower there is really nothing special just windows where you can look around seoul up high.,1266,nothing
1267,132,5320,went at night in Jan 13. took a bus from chungmuro station to the N Seoul Tower. teddy bear museum is quite okay as you can take alot of pictures. but the observation tower is so so~ very crowded and i think there is nothing much to view with the fog in winter.,1267,nothing
1268,133,5355,We came here because it was such a landmark building in Seoul. There was nothing special about this place... It was just one if those towers for viewing the city. The view was not that impressive.,1268,nothing
1269,134,5378,A trip to Seoul is not complete without going to the tower. The view is great (suggest you go at night) but there is nothing much to do once you're there.,1269,nothing
1270,135,5422,"It's nothing special, just a good view of Seoul. And you have paid money for entrance ticket just for view?",1270,nothing
1271,136,5440,"I went here twice in a row for the past two years every time I visit Seoul. I came here during winter so it's really no big deal to walk that high to reach the N-tower. Yes, from the bus stop, we need to walk pretty high to reach the are. There's no ladder whatsoever, so we have to, well literally climb, the hill. I'm sure my friends whom I've brought here lose their breath every 100meters. Hahaha. Just make sure you know that there's a pretty sloppy road to reach the tower.  To reach N-tower you can use the gondola from Myeongdong, which is pretty expensive, or you can go by bus from nearest area downtown. I stopped at Konkuk uni, and wait for the bus number 2,3,or 5 to go to N-tower. Going by bus is really nice, since you can experience how crazy Korean bus drivers are. Their driving skill is really scary! If you go by bus, make sure you take a seat. I don't really recommend you standing on a Korean bus though.  I am not really into a gondola for a city view, so I better save that money for riding gondola at Seorak Mountain. Anyway, you have to go to N-tower in the evening. Around 4 pm maybe then you can arrive there around 5 or 6, and you can see an illuminated Seoul. It's really beautiful.  I can't say that there's nothing you can do here. I always spent like 3-4 hours here. My friends like to see what's written in the locks. There's a lot of steel trees with locks. People say you can write your wish on the lock and put the lock on the tree then your wish may come true. Well, at least mine. We love to take pictures here, it's really like photographers' site though.  There's also a restaurant at the top of the tower, and several other restaurants with nice views at the ground floor. We can enjoy the view while having dinner. Then there's several souvenir shops which are hard to miss on. They sell various nice stuffs with N-tower emboss. The price is not very expensive too. If you are lucky perhaps you can find something even more cheaper than the one in Namdaemun.  In N-tower, there's a teddy bear museum. I only went here once. Practically showing Korean history throughout centuries but using teddy bear as the diorama. Cute place, you can take pictures too inside. The price is pretty expensive, but if you are not planning to go to Jeju island, it's better you go to this place. Yes, there's also one teddy bear museum in Jeju island as one of Jeju's main attraction.  To go inside N-tower, you don't need an entrance fee. But to go to the top of the tower, and to go inside teddy bear museum, yes, you need an entrance fee. Any choice is up to you and I don't think money is really a matter for such experience.",1271,nothing
1272,137,5441,"This tower is best for couples. You can bring or buy love lock there and put it to the fence as a symbol of ""securing your love"". The scenery from there is beautiful, but the tower is not really high and nothing really special about it.",1272,nothing
