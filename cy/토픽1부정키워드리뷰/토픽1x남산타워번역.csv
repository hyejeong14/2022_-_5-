8,8,8,311,"Namsan Tower is a Korean landmark, and it is one of the tallest towers in Asia. It offers not only a view of all of Seoul, but also a chance to enjoy a meal inside the tower. At first, Namsan Tower was used for broadcasting, and then fully open to the public, it is worth watching the Namsan Tower lock wall, slowly a wall of locks, and the lock hanging on it must be a couple together. Now, the Nanshan Tower locked wall is a very popular tourist attraction. At Nanshan Tower, the highlight is that there are interpreters for multiple languages so that you do not have to worry about language barriers. Secondly, the entertainment near the tower is also very much available, which can satisfy no longer a single view of a tourist destination but can enjoy food and shopping at the same time as viewing the landscape.",8,much,"남산타워는 한국의 랜드마크이자 아시아에서 가장 높은 타워 중 하나입니다. 서울 전체를 조망할 수 있을 뿐만 아니라 타워 안에서 식사를 즐길 수 있는 기회도 제공한다. 처음에는 남산타워가 방송용으로 쓰였다가 이후 전면 개방되어 남산타워 자물쇠 벽, 천천히 자물쇠 벽, 그리고 그 위에 걸려 있는 자물쇠가 커플이 되어야 하는 모습을 볼 만하다. 이제 남산루(南山塔)는 매우 인기 있는 관광명소가 되었습니다. Nanshan Tower의 하이라이트는 다국어 통역사가 있으므로 언어 ​​장벽에 대해 걱정할 필요가 없다는 것입니다. 둘째, 타워 주변에 즐길거리도 매우 많아 관광지를 한눈에 바라볼 수 있는 것이 아니라 풍경을 바라보며 음식과 쇼핑을 동시에 즐길 수 있다."

After purchasing the tickets, we have to stand in a very long queue which goes up two floors to reach the cable car station. It too us 40 minutes before we got into the car. The ride was smooth, but the view from the car and from the tower is nothing special. We went there in the night expecting nice views, but there is too much light which prevents us from getting a good view of the city (see picture).

There are restaurants and souvenier shops in the tower.",12,much,타워 꼭대기까지 가는 방법은 하이킹과 케이블카 두 가지가 있습니다. 우리는 케이블카를 타기로 했다. 티켓을 구입한 후 케이블카 정류장까지 2층으로 올라가는 아주 긴 줄을 서야 합니다. 우리도 차에 오르기 40분 전에. 승차감은 부드러웠지만 차와 타워에서 바라보는 전망은 특별할 것이 없습니다. 우리는 멋진 전망을 기대하고 밤에 거기에 갔지만 도시의 좋은 전망을 얻지 못하게하는 너무 많은 빛이 있습니다 (그림 참조). 자물쇠를 사용하여 타워의 난간에 '사랑을 잠그기'위해 오는 많은 젊은 커플. 이것은 대중적인 믿음인 것 같습니다. 타워에는 레스토랑과 기념품 가게가 있습니다.
13,13,13,398,"Perched on a hill accessible only by a town bus or the cable car, this provides a great view of the city of Seoul!  We went by cable car - and it was easy and fuss free. Climbing up the stairs you’d be greeted by a stall selling snacks. Try out the soup fish cakes... divine especially in cold weather. A little further up you will see the locks and love messages... there the Hawkeyed would Spy “abandoned” phone cases but these have handwritten (presumably love) notes scrawled in permanent ink... we didn’t get a chance to do this ☺️. Perhaps next round!  We purposely chose to go up later in the day just to see Seoul’s night light. If you are the sort who’d like to spot landmarks, please go before sundown.

Great views of the city, however",15,much,우리는 여행의 일부로 여기에서 멈췄으므로 우리를 엘리베이터로 안내하는 안내원이있었습니다. 경내는 쾌적하고 여러 곳에서 옛 성벽의 일부를 볼 수 있습니다. 엘리베이터의 라이트 쇼는 조금 많았습니다. 모든 창문이 있는 최상층은 기념품 가게로 가득 차 있었다. 그러나 도시의 멋진 전망

18,18,18,464,"One of the best viewing platforms in Seoul. Only costs around £4 compared to £16 at Seoul's Sky. Although the observation deck is lower the view is much more beautiful than Seoul sky and you can see all the sky scrappers which are especially nice during dusk and at night when everything lights up and there is an outdoor observatory too. Forget Seoul Sky, do this instead.  Recommended",18,much,서울 최고의 전망대 중 하나. 서울스카이의 가격은 £16에 비해 £4 정도입니다. 전망대는 낮지만 서울 하늘보다 훨씬 더 아름다운 풍경을 볼 수 있으며 특히 해질녘과 밤에 모든 것이 조명을 켜고 야외 전망대가 있는 밤에 특히 멋진 모든 스카이 스크래퍼를 볼 수 있습니다. 서울스카이는 ​​잊어버리고 대신 이렇게 하세요. 추천
19,19,19,465,"Well, you gotta do it when in Seoul, right? Trouble is, everyone else had the same idea, so it was 'rammed' at the top.

I'm glad we went; but it was just ok, and didn't 'wow'-me.",19,much,"글쎄, 당신은 서울에있을 때 그것을해야, 그렇지? 문제는 다른 모든 사람들이 같은 생각을 했기 때문에 맨 위에 '충격을 주었다'는 것입니다. 예상대로 멋진 전망이지만 선물 가게의 눈부신 빛이 야간에 창문에 너무 많이 반사되어 사진을 약간 망칠 수 있습니다. 우리가 가서 기쁩니다. 그러나 그것은 단지 ok이었다. 그리고 나는 '와우'하지 않았다."
20,20,20,468,"We made the mistake of trusting Google Maps to get up to the tower. It took us to no man's land and our curvaceous Tongan bodies had to hike up the mountain certain someone would have a heart attack on the way. Though it seemed like a bad idea, once we finally got up the mountain we felt like Rocky Balboa or that we had conquered the world and we got much needed exercise.  The view on the Sky Tower was as expected however the highlight were the toilets with a view. Wish I had needed to go at the time because that would've been a memorable 1.",20,much,"우리는 타워에 올라갈 때 Google 지도를 신뢰하는 실수를 저질렀습니다. 그것은 우리를 사람이 살지 않는 땅으로 데려갔고, 곡선미가 있는 통가인의 몸은 도중에 누군가가 심장마비를 일으킬 것이라는 확신이 있는 산을 올라야 했습니다. 안 좋은 생각이었지만, 마침내 산에 오르자 마치 록키 발보아가 된 것 같거나 세계를 정복한 것 같은 기분이 들었고 필요한 운동을 많이 했습니다. 스카이 타워의 전망은 예상대로였지만 하이라이트는 전망이 있는 화장실이었습니다. 그것이 기억에 남는 1이었을 것이기 때문에 내가 그 당시에 갈 필요가 있었으면 좋겠다."
21,21,21,470,"We were there on a Korean holiday so it was very crowded. So much so, the line was too long to up up into the tower. We went by cart as far as we could and walked around Namsan Park.

Great perspective of the highly populated, dense city.",21,much,"우리는 한국 휴일에 거기에 있었기 때문에 매우 혼잡했습니다. 그래서인지 타워까지 올라가기에는 줄이 너무 길었다. 최대한 카트를 타고 남산공원을 걸었다. 거기에서 조차 아래의 건물은 ""레고랜드""처럼 보였다. 인구 밀도가 높은 도시의 멋진 전망."
22,22,22,471,"There are 2 ways to visit N seoul tower, by cable car or to hike up. My siblings and i decided to hike up as the cable car waiting time was 1 hour. It was a long hike with stairs and its tiring. So I recommend to take the cable car if you are with kids or if you dont plan to exercise 😂😂 N seoul tower itself was nice, the view was great !! 😍 its mostly just enjoying the view and also chilling around that area ! So if you love looking at the views and take photographs then this is for you otherwise there’s nothing much to do.",22,much,N 서울 타워를 방문하는 방법은 케이블카를 이용하는 방법과 하이킹을 이용하는 방법이 있습니다. 케이블카 대기시간이 1시간이라 남매와 나는 등산을 하기로 했다. 계단이 많고 피곤한 긴 하이킹이었습니다. 그래서 아이들과 함께 가거나 운동을 할 계획이 없다면 케이블카를 타는 것을 추천합니다 😂😂 N서울타워 자체도 좋고 뷰도 좋았어요!! 😍 대부분은 경치를 즐기고 그 지역에서 차가워지는 것입니다! 따라서 전망을보고 사진을 찍는 것을 좋아한다면 이것은 당신을위한 것입니다. 그렇지 않으면 할 일이별로 없습니다.
23,23,23,484,"We went up by cable car and when we arrived we found the whole area looked very dated. Admittedly, there are very good views from the top of the tower but we thought there are much better places to visit than here, unless you've got plenty of time in Seoul. By all means, go and have a look but ensure the sky's clear because you'd only go up there for the views, the tower itself and immediate surrounding areas are a little underwhelming, and that includes the Hello Kitty Island experience which I can only recommend if you are a die-hard Hello Kitty fan. Even for the likes of us, who find Hello Kitty quite cute, it was not worth our time.",23,much,우리는 케이블카로 올라갔고 우리가 도착했을 때 우리는 전체 지역이 매우 낡아 보였다는 것을 알았습니다. 물론 타워 꼭대기에서 바라보는 전망도 아주 좋지만 서울에서 시간이 충분하지 않다면 여기보다 더 좋은 곳이 있을 거라고 생각했습니다. 꼭 올라가서 하늘이 맑은지 확인하세요. 타워 자체와 바로 주변 지역은 약간 실망스럽습니다. 여기에는 내가 할 수 있는 헬로키티 아일랜드 체험만 포함됩니다. 열혈 헬로 키티 팬이라면 추천합니다. 헬로 키티가 꽤 귀엽다고 생각하는 우리 같은 사람들에게도 시간이 아깝지 않았습니다.
24,24,24,488,"So we recently visited the tower and I thought I might write down how we went about it and some suggestions. --------------------------------- When to go:  So we visited in early August and found that the best time to to go was the evening (of course this will depend on weather and month etc) . I would suggest you arrive at the tower by 7.00pm and be on the viewing platform by 7.30pm, as by 8.00pm it will be dark. This will allow you to view Seoul during the golden hour, sunset and night (when the whole city lights up). This will probably be one of the more busier times though, so beware. If you want a less busy experience maybe go early morning or around lunch and be don't visit on a weekend but a weekday. ---------------------------- How to get there:  We were staying in myengdong area which conveniently had a bus that takes about 15 mins to go directly to the entrance of Seoul tower. It comes every 15 mins and costs around 1,200 won without a tcard and 1,100 with. For those staying in myengdong the bus stop is to the right of myengdong Station entrance 2. The bus you will need to catch is the no. 5. Those staying in chongmyeong can catch either the no. 2 or 5. There are other methods of getting there. You could taxi or get the train to the bottom of the park and get the cable car up.  I would suggest that if you want to walk the hill/ Park area to get to the tower, that you should walk down instead of up. It is a step climb up, with quite alot of stairs and steep slopes. It would take you a good 30 mins plus to get to the top and you will be tired. ----------------------- Seoul tower Park:  So beneath Seoul tower is a sort of park area with a few viewing platforms, one of which is covered in love locks. I would recommend getting some of your photos group photos here. Its a little less busy and the view is almost as good. Beneath the tower there are many places to eat and shops. --------------------------- Seoul tower  The tickets can be bought online and at the tower. We bought at the tower and don't encounyer much of a queue. Tickets cost 10,000 won per adult and 8000 won for children and seniors. They are open tickets which mean there are no time slots allocated. You can enter the tower when you please and stay as long as you like.  There is one main viewing platform and it will be busy but the views are stunning. If you find yourself needing to get away from the hubub I would suggest you go down to the next level (sub viewing platform) and go to the toilet. Each has its own private view and the facilities are very nice.  I saw quite places to eat on each level with lots of different choices e.g Italian, Korean,  Chinese etc. I don't, however, know how much it costs. ------------------- Getting down:  When finished there are multiple ways to get down. The bus which you took to go up, the cable car and the walk. The cable car costs 7000 per adult and takes about 10-15 mins to get down to the bottom where it will drop you off near myengodon, where you can get to myengdong Station or just walk home.  However, if you are feeling up to it I would suggest walking down.  The path is well light, nicely paved with great views all the way down. It has a great view of the tower and its a nice stroll through the park area. The path is just left of the cable car when facing down the hill. I think it took us about 20 mins to get down. You will just about the reach the same area that the cable car will drop you off at. From there its a 10-15 min walk back to myengdong main street. --------------------- Worth it?  I believe so but I am a sucker for a good view and a relative payed for most of the trip. I can see how it may fall flat for many as it is very busy tourist hot spot which is arguably overpriced. I believe families should see this is as one of their big nights out. I still think those on a budget should go but maybe limit there spending by walking and taking snacks up with them to eat in the park. While Seoul tower is arguably the most iconic, there are still other platforms you can choose from. Also, if you were just viewing during the day and wanted a challenge then instead of observation decks go to some of the mountains that surround the city. We went to bukhansan (1/2 day quite hard hiking) which has amazing views.  Hope this helps people out. Sorry its so long, thought the detail would be good. --------- Protip: For those who do go in the evening (who are treating this like one of their big nights out) and finish the tower looking for dinner I would suggest going to woori Garden korean bbq in myengdong. Amazing stuff.",24,much,"그래서 우리는 최근에 타워를 방문했고 우리가 그것에 대해 어떻게 했는지와 몇 가지 제안을 적어볼 수 있을 거라고 생각했습니다. ---------------------------------- 갈 때: 그래서 우리는 8월 초에 방문했고 가장 좋은 시기는 가는 것은 저녁이었다 (물론 이것은 날씨와 달 등에 달려 있을 것이다). 오후 7시까지 타워에 도착하고 오후 7시 30분까지 전망대에 도착하는 것이 좋습니다. 이렇게 하면 골든 아워, 일몰, 밤(도시 전체가 밝을 때) 동안 서울을 볼 수 있습니다. 이것은 아마도 가장 바쁜 시간 중 하나가 될 것이므로 조심하십시오. 덜 바쁜 경험을 원한다면 이른 아침이나 점심 시간에 가서 주말이 아닌 평일에 방문하십시오. ---------------------------- 찾아가는 방법: 버스가 15분 정도 소요되는 편리한 명동 지역에 머물고 있었습니다. 서울타워 입구로 직진. 15분 간격으로 오고 요금은 티카드 없이 1,200원, 있으면 1,100원입니다. 명동에 머무시는 분들은 버스정류장이 명동역 2번출구 오른쪽에 있습니다. 타야 할 버스는 2번입니다. 5. 총명에 머무는 사람들은 어느 쪽이든 잡을 수 있습니다. 2 또는 5. 거기에 가는 다른 방법이 있습니다. 당신은 택시를 타거나 기차를 타고 공원 바닥까지 가서 케이블카를 탈 수 있습니다. 언덕 / 공원 지역을 걸어서 타워에 가려면 위로 걸어가는 대신 아래로 걸어가는 것이 좋습니다. 꽤 많은 계단과 가파른 경사가 있는 계단 오르막입니다. 정상까지 가려면 30분 정도 더 걸리고 피곤할 것입니다. ----------------------- 서울 타워 공원: 서울 타워 아래에는 몇 개의 전망대가 있는 일종의 공원 지역이 있습니다. 그 중 하나는 사랑으로 덮여 있습니다. 자물쇠. 나는 당신의 사진 단체 사진 중 일부를 여기에서 얻는 것이 좋습니다. 조금 덜 바쁘고 전망이 거의 비슷합니다. 타워 아래에는 먹을 곳과 상점이 많이 있습니다. --------------------------- 서울 타워 티켓은 온라인과 타워에서 구입할 수 있습니다. 우리는 타워에서 샀고 대기열이 많이 필요하지 않습니다. 입장료는 어른 1만원, 어린이와 시니어 8000원이다. 그들은 할당된 시간 슬롯이 없음을 의미하는 공개 티켓입니다. 원하는 시간에 타워에 들어가 원하는 만큼 머무를 수 있습니다. 하나의 주요 관람 플랫폼이 있으며 혼잡할 것이지만 전망은 훌륭합니다. 허브에서 벗어나야 하는 자신을 발견하면 다음 레벨(하위 전망대)로 내려가 화장실에 가는 것이 좋습니다. 각각의 전용 뷰가 있으며 시설이 매우 좋습니다. 나는 이탈리아, 한국, 중국 등 다양한 선택으로 각 층에서 먹을 수 있는 곳을 보았지만 비용이 얼마인지는 모릅니다. ------------------- 내리기: 끝나면 여러 가지 방법으로 내릴 수 있습니다. 올라가기 위해 탔던 버스와 케이블카, 그리고 도보. 케이블카 요금은 성인 1인당 7000이며, 바닥까지 약 10-15분이 소요되며, 이곳에서 면동역까지 가거나 걸어서 집에 갈 수 있는 면고돈 근처에서 하차합니다. 그래도 괜찮다면 내려가는 걸 추천합니다. 길은 잘 가벼우며 아래로 내려가는 내내 멋진 전망을 즐길 수 있도록 잘 포장되어 있습니다. 타워의 멋진 전망과 공원 지역을 산책하는 것이 좋습니다. 길은 언덕 아래로 향할 때 케이블카 바로 왼쪽에 있습니다. 내려오는 데 20분 정도 걸린 것 같아요. 케이블카가 내리는 곳과 거의 같은 지역에 도달하게 됩니다. 거기에서 명동 메인 스트리트까지 도보로 10-15분이 소요됩니다. ---------- 가치가 있습니까? 나는 그렇게 믿는다. 그러나 나는 좋은 전망과 친척이 대부분의 여행에 대해 지불하는 빨판이다. 틀림없이 고가의 매우 바쁜 관광 명소이기 때문에 많은 사람들에게 그것이 어떻게 평평해질 수 있는지 알 수 있습니다. 나는 가족들이 이것이 그들의 큰 밤 중 하나임을 알아야 한다고 믿습니다. 나는 여전히 예산이 있는 사람들이 가야 한다고 생각하지만 공원에서 식사를 하기 위해 산책을 하고 간식을 챙겨가는 것으로 지출을 제한할 수 있습니다. 서울 타워는 틀림없이 가장 상징적이지만 선택할 수 있는 다른 플랫폼이 있습니다. 또한 낮에 구경만 하고 도전하고 싶다면 전망대 대신 도시를 둘러싸고 있는 산으로 가보세요. 우리는 놀라운 전망을 가진 북한산(1/2일 꽤 힘든 하이킹)에 갔다. 이것이 사람들을 돕기를 바랍니다. 너무 길어서 죄송합니다. 세부 사항이 좋을 것이라고 생각했습니다. --------- Protip: 저녁에 가서 저녁을 먹으러 타워를 끝내고 저녁에 가는 사람들(명동에 있는 우리 가든 한식 바베큐에 가는 것을 추천합니다) . 놀라운 물건."
25,25,25,490,"Great views of the city. Not as tall as the Lotte Seoul Tower, but set up on a hill which gives it almost as much of a commanding view.

It's on a much smaller scale than the TeamLab Borderless one but amazing nonetheless. You will have to pay more to go up but so worth it, the observation views are gorgeous and you really get a unique view of this special city. There's even a post office box up there that you can send postcards to the USA and other countries from. Great experience!",26,much,"부드럽고 안전한 탑승, 사랑의 자물쇠, 서울의 아름다운 전망, 그리고 타워에 들어가면 일본의 TeamLab Borderless와 같은 경험을 할 수 있습니다. TeamLab Borderless보다 훨씬 작은 규모이지만 그럼에도 불구하고 놀랍습니다. 올라가려면 더 많은 비용을 지불해야 하지만 그만한 가치가 있는 전망을 감상할 수 있고 이 특별한 도시의 독특한 전망을 감상할 수 있습니다. 미국 및 기타 국가로 엽서를 보낼 수 있는 우체국 상자도 있습니다. 굉장한 경험!"

We just need to take the physical entrance slip at the kiosks with the mobile confirmation.  There are some shops and restaurants/eateries at the Tower.  It's a popular place and must visit.

The cost doesn’t get you to the top which I do find disappointing. You have to pay an additional cost of 11,200 at the half way point to go the all the way in an elevator to the “top”. 3of our party did and 3 stayed behind. They enjoyed their extra trip which had an exhibition at the top. The cable cars were larger on the return journey which I found very reassuring.

You may order the entry ticket online and get ¥6000 which most people do. Try out some websites. The view is authentic especially the night view but the viewing deck is relatively congested.

I went in the morning and walked, instead of using the cable car. Surprisingly, there were many facilities that offer food and drinks, including draft beer. Based on my experience, I would suggest to go late afternoon to have a dinner, see the panorama in daylight and after dark, and enjoy glass of beer.

You head down some steps into a concourse area where you can buy drinks and trinkets. I purchased my ticket for the observatory and waited in line for the elevator to the observation area.  Essentially I paid 10,000 krw to ride a lift and look out of windows covered in the handprints and faceprints of small children, all the while getting barged out of the way by impatient tourists.

There are several restaurants should you feel hungry and want to eat. There is a convenience store for your basic needs.

First of all, you can't get up to the tower area itself without walking up or taking a city bus or being part of a tour. No cars are allowed. That part was okay as we did go up by bus. What was disappointing was that it seemed very commercialized. There was a fee to go to the top of the tower. That was understandable but then.they take a photo of you when you enter which of course comes with a price tag. And it was extra to go into the Hello Kitty area which seemed like a promo store??? We didn't go in. Don't get me wrong, the view was nice from the top and outside where you have the love locks and park area. I guess I'm just a bit jaded because of my disappointment.

It was quite a hike from Myeongdong to the cable car station to bring us up the tower (I forgot how much but around 9000 won roundtrip), but it’s manageable. After getting off the cable car, you can already see colorful “love locks” all over; you can place your own. (If you don’t have a lock they sell it there.) You can also take photos of the Tower from that area. Then there is an option to pay to get up the N tower itself. Since we didn’t want to eat another buffet meal, we only got the tickets with pizza and pasta meal for 2 (not at the top of the tower though), but the pizza especially was superb. At the tower itself, we didn’t need to stay long; 15-20 minutes was more than enough.

(자물쇠가 없으면 그곳에서 판매합니다.) 그 지역에서 타워의 사진을 찍을 수도 있습니다. 그런 다음 N 타워 자체를 올라가기 위해 지불하는 옵션이 있습니다. 우리는 다른 뷔페 식사를 먹고 싶지 않았기 때문에 2 인분의 피자와 파스타 식사가 포함 된 티켓 만 얻었지만 (타워 꼭대기는 아니지만) 피자는 특히 훌륭했습니다. 타워 자체에서 우리는 오래 머물 필요가 없었습니다. 15~20분이면 충분했다. 그래도 부산타워에서 사람들과 인사를 나눌 수 있는 인터랙티브 부스 게임은 재미있었습니다. :)

50,50,50,685,"Well, what to say really? Yes, it's obvious what the place is, it's a VERY popular tower on top of a mountain with viewing platform and restraunts up there. An yes, Korean restraunt up there was really nice and I'll review that separately. But as for the tower, the queue for the cable car up was easily 30 minutes, problems more like 40 plus, and this was a Sunday night. Don't be fooled by the queue for the tickets on ground level, that's just the start of your long, long quest to the top of the building, to get the cable car to the top of the mountain. I call it a quest, as it's almost something worthy of two small hobbits. I had read reviews that mentioned the queues, however I didn't quite read in enough detail to prepare for the queues that lay ahead, and I'm British, we're known for queueing, but I now think we should be handing that title for the Koreans. Then, once you finally get on the cable car and get to the top of the mountain, you can stop and have a look at the views from there, and then queue a further 40 minutes for the lifts up the tower proper. Now a good tip here, is to book a restaurant package to go up the tower, as this skips the lift queue up for you. View from the top is nice, but without the restaurant meal, it would have menat 80 minutes plus of queueing to get there. Then, to come down, repeat all the queuing again, so it was 40 miuntes to the bottom of the tower, which sadly the restaurant meal does not enable you to skip, and then another 40 minutes for the cable car. I know there's a bus to the top that misses the cable car, and we didn't try those so can't comment. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also climb the mountain on foot, althouh we thought that for an evening dinner out that might be a bit much. Overall a nice view, if you patient enough for the queues.",50,much,"글쎄요, 정말 뭐라고 할까요? 예, 장소가 무엇인지는 분명합니다. 전망대와 레스토랑이 있는 산 꼭대기에 있는 매우 인기 있는 타워입니다. 예, 거기에 있는 한국 식당은 정말 좋았고 별도로 리뷰하겠습니다. 그러나 타워의 경우 케이블카를 타기 위한 대기열은 쉽게 30분, 문제는 40분 이상이었고 일요일 밤이었습니다. 지상층의 티켓을 기다리는 대기열에 속지 마세요. 케이블카를 타고 산 정상까지 올라가기 위한 길고 긴 여정의 시작일 뿐입니다. 나는 그것을 퀘스트라고 부르는데, 그것은 거의 두 명의 작은 호빗에게 가치가 있는 일이기 때문입니다. 대기열에 대해 언급한 리뷰를 읽었지만 앞으로 닥칠 대기열에 대비할 만큼 충분히 자세히 읽지 않았습니다. 저는 영국인이고 대기열로 유명하지만 지금은 그것을 전달해야 한다고 생각합니다. 한국인의 타이틀. 그런 다음 마침내 케이블카를 타고 산 꼭대기에 도착하면 멈춰서 그곳에서 전망을 볼 수 있습니다. 그런 다음 타워를 제대로 올라가는 리프트를 위해 40분 더 대기할 수 있습니다. 이제 여기에서 좋은 팁은 타워에 올라가기 위해 레스토랑 패키지를 예약하는 것입니다. 이렇게 하면 리프트 대기열을 건너뛸 수 있습니다. 정상에서의 전망은 좋지만 레스토랑 식사가 없으면 거기에 도착하기 위해 80분을 더 기다려야 합니다. 그런 다음 내려오려면 모든 대기열을 다시 반복하십시오. 그래서 타워 바닥까지 40분이 걸렸습니다. 슬프게도 레스토랑 식사를 건너뛸 수는 없으며 케이블카를 타려면 40분을 더 가야 합니다. 나는 케이블카를 놓치는 정상에 버스가 있다는 것을 알고 있고 우리는 그것을 시도하지 않았으므로 논평할 수 없다. 모험심이 강하다면 도보로 산을 오를 수도 있습니다. 하지만 저녁 외식을 하기에는 양이 좀 많을 거라 생각했습니다. 대기열에 대해 충분히 참을 경우 전반적으로 멋진 전망입니다."

It doesn't cost much to go up the tower (only 10000 KRW per person, plus there is a bundle of 2 popcorns + 2 beers for 26000 KRW which we availed of). The top of the tower itself was quite small, in terms of circumference. Only housing a candy store and a souvenir shop were located at the main viewing deck, with a non-advertised coffee shop at the lower floor which we would've gone to and stayed at if we had only known (they're the only accessible non-restaurant establishment with seats).

The cable car is just a few minute ride so we opted to walk. It takes about 30 minutes to walk up (much longer for us as we kept stopping to take pictures of the view!).  We did not enter the tower itself (there is a fee) but we enjoyed the scenery at the top. There are some restaurants at the bottom of the tower.,56,much,이 지역은 명동 지역에서 도보 거리에 있습니다(약 15-20분). 그런 다음 케이블카를 타거나 타워까지 걸어 갈 수있는 옵션이 있습니다. 케이블카는 걸어서 몇 분 거리에 있으므로 걸어서 가기로 했습니다. 걸어서 올라가는 데 약 30분이 걸립니다(우리가 계속해서 멈춰서 경치를 사진에 담기 때문에 훨씬 더 오래 걸립니다!). 우리는 타워 자체에 들어가지 않았지만 (유료) 정상의 경치를 즐겼습니다. 타워 아래에는 레스토랑이 있습니다.

After getting off the cable car, please proceed to B1 of observatory tower to print your ticket using Klook barcode issued to you.

Leading up to the tower are hundreds of locks with couples names on them that are locked on the guard railings. There are some restrictions for those putting theirs up and if you don't follow their rules, your lock will be removed at the end of the night.

60,60,60,834,Here's the scoop : don't take a taxi. Just take bus 02 or 05 from some areas around the city including Myeongdong and it brings you all the up to the base of the tower. It's only 1200 for adults 350 for kids. Same thing when you are returning back. The cable car is 7000 one way for adults and connects from the base of the tower to a middle station. For us we have been in many before and it didn't justify the short ride. Spend some 1-1.5 hours at the base of the tower and take in the beautiful views of the city. The weather was great and we took lots of photos. And we didn't pay to go up the tower because every country has a talk tower and it's pretty much the same 😀,60,much,"특종은 다음과 같습니다. 택시를 타지 마십시오. 명동을 포함한 시내 일부 지역에서 02번 또는 05번 버스를 타면 타워 기슭까지 모두 모입니다. 성인은 1200, 어린이는 350입니다. 돌아올 때도 마찬가지입니다. 케이블카는 성인 편도 7000이며, 타워 기단에서 중간역까지 연결된다. 우리는 이전에 많은 경험을 했고 짧은 여행을 정당화하지 못했습니다. 타워 기슭에서 약 1-1.5 시간을 보내고 도시의 아름다운 전망을 감상하십시오. 날씨가 좋아서 사진을 많이 찍었습니다. 그리고 우리는 모든 나라에 토크 타워가 있고 거의 비슷하기 때문에 타워를 오르는 데 비용을 지불하지 않았습니다 😀"
61,61,61,835,"Another reviewer said ""...Yes, there is a cable car. But the hike is very easy - it's reasonably flat and you get pretty good views all the way up."" That is what it said in the book on Seoul that I bought in Honolulu before going to Seoul. My wife and I found the opposite to be true. I took as 3 hours to get from where out taxi dropped us off to the top. In retrospect there was a Bus stop sign at the bottom but no idea when it might come so we elected to walk. Three hours later (with seven yellow busses passing us going up during the time it took us to walk there) we arrived with my wife very sore legs and mad. ""Reasonably Flat""... I don't think so.. I would call it steep.  Once we finally arrived it was nice. We went to the upper level W 10,000 each, and got a framed souvenir photo W 25,000 which was nice... you can choose your background of views from the tower.  Unfortunately, it was very cloudy that day, and we couldn't see much of anything of the city from the tower, but they did warn us about that before charging us to go to the upper level, and after that hike we wanted to go up anyway. I think i would be spectacular when it is not cloudy... it was just our bad luck the weather was like that. I hope someday we can go there when the weather is good!  We enjoyed the fence where the lovers attach the padlocks with their names together and took some pictures there, and the Vanilla Shake at the Ice Cream concession was delicious.  We decided to take the cable car back down, which was scenic, but we found that once we arrived it was a long walk to MyongDong Subway Station, which the map implies was colocated with the Cable Car terminal... it is not. It is also a steep road from the Cable Car terminal down, so if you were going to walk up from the MyongDong Subway Station to the cable car terminal it would be quite a hike... although certainly less than the alternative hiking trail.  If we go there again I would either: 1. Wait for the Yellow Bus at the bottom of the Hiking Trail where the taxi dropped us off ... I think he sign at the top said the Bus was only W 1,200 or something like that.  OR 2. Insist that the taxi take you all the way to the Cable Car terminal... and get the hotel or somebody to write that in Korean to show the driver since it appears none of the taxi driver's understand English.  The fare for the Cable Car is almost the same for round trip as one way, so IF you can be sure the taxi will take you all the way to the Cable Car terminal that is probably the best choice. Otherwise the Yellow Bus from the bottom of the hiking trail.  Aside from that I agree with all the other observations of the review by EmmaVestrheim.",61,much,"다른 평론가는 ""...네, 케이블카가 있습니다. 하지만 하이킹은 매우 쉽습니다. 비교적 평평하고 올라가는 내내 꽤 좋은 전망을 볼 수 있습니다.""라고 말했습니다. 서울에 가기 전에 호놀룰루에서 샀던 서울에 관한 책에 그렇게 적혀 있었다. 아내와 나는 그 반대가 사실임을 발견했습니다. 나는 택시가 우리를 정상까지 내려준 곳에서 3시간이 걸렸다. 돌이켜보면 맨 아래에 버스 정류장 표시가 있었지만 언제 올지 몰라서 우리는 걷기로 결정했습니다. 3시간 후(7개의 노란색 버스가 우리를 지나고 그곳에서 걸어가는 동안 올라가고 있음) 우리는 아내와 함께 다리가 매우 아프고 화를 내고 도착했습니다. ""합리적으로 평평한""... 나는 그렇게 생각하지 않습니다. 나는 그것을 가파르다고 부를 것입니다. 우리가 마침내 도착했을 때 그것은 멋졌다. 우리는 상위층에 각각 10,000원에 가서 기념사진 액자에 25,000원을 받았어요. 좋았습니다... 타워에서 바라보는 배경을 고를 수 있어요. 불행히도 그날은 매우 흐려서 타워에서 도시의 많은 것을 볼 수 없었습니다. 어쨌든 위로. 흐리지 않으면 장관일 것 같은데.. 날씨가 이랬더니 운이 나빴다. 언젠가는 날씨가 좋을 때 갈 수 있기를 바랍니다! 연인들이 이름이 적힌 자물쇠를 함께 걸고 사진을 찍는 담장을 즐겼는데 아이스크림 매점의 바닐라 셰이크가 맛있었다. 우리는 경치가 좋은 케이블카를 다시 타기로 결정했지만 일단 도착하면 명동 지하철역까지 긴 도보 거리라는 것을 알았습니다. 지도에서 암시하는 것처럼 케이블카 터미널과 같은 위치에 있습니다. 그렇지 않습니다. 케이블카 터미널에서 내려가는 길도 가파르기 때문에 지하철 명동역에서 케이블카 터미널까지 걸어 올라가면 꽤 하이킹이 될 것입니다. 물론 다른 등산로보다는 덜하지만요. 우리가 다시 거기에 간다면 나는 다음 중 하나를 할 것입니다 : 1. 택시가 우리를 내려 준 하이킹 트레일 하단에서 노란색 버스를 기다리십시오 ... 상단에 그가 버스가 단지 W 1,200 또는 그와 비슷한 것이라고 서명 한 것 같습니다. . 또는 2. 택시가 당신을 케이블카 터미널까지 데려다 준다고 주장하고... 택시 기사가 영어를 이해하지 못하는 것 같기 때문에 호텔이나 누군가가 그것을 기사에게 보여주기 위해 한국어로 작성하게 하십시오. 케이블카 요금은 편도와 왕복 요금이 거의 동일하므로 택시를 타고 케이블카 터미널까지 가는 것이 가장 좋은 선택일 것입니다. 그렇지 않으면 하이킹 트레일 바닥에서 노란색 버스를 타십시오. 그 외에 EmmaVestrheim의 리뷰에 대한 다른 모든 관찰에 동의합니다."

One thing that we didn’t realize was that it’s kind of a romantic place fire couples to go and place a lock with their name on it on the fence.

69,69,69,933,"We were here nearing sunset. The view of Seoul from Namsan Park was great but not the view from the observatory deck which cost 10k won. We felt that the glass was stained and could not provide a clear view. Especially at night, the glass was reflected by the bright light from inside the deck. Ended up, we could not see much of the view and have to constantly get ourselves as near as to the glass and kept wiping the condensed glass. We also felt that the deck was more like a souvenir shop as it was very packed and the walkway was narrow.  Other than that, the line was long too. So there were waiting, lining, waiting and lining. Pretty standard for touristy spot.  Would recommend to just view the skyline at Namsan Park instead. The sunset was good too.",69,much,"우리는 일몰에 가까워지고 있었습니다. 남산공원에서 바라보는 서울의 풍경은 좋았지만 1만원대 전망대에서 바라보는 풍경은 아니었다. 우리는 유리가 더러워져 선명한 시야를 제공하지 못한다고 느꼈습니다. 특히 밤에는 데크 내부의 밝은 빛에 유리가 반사되었습니다. 결국, 우리는 많은 전망을 볼 수 없었고 끊임없이 유리에 가까이 다가가서 응축 유리를 계속 닦아야했습니다. 우리도 데크가 꽉 차고 산책로가 좁아서 기념품 가게 같다는 느낌을 받았다. 그 외에 줄이 너무 길었어요. 그래서 기다리고, 줄을 서고, 기다리고, 줄을 섰습니다. 관광지에 대한 꽤 표준입니다. 대신 남산 공원의 스카이 라인을 보는 것이 좋습니다. 일몰도 좋았다."
70,70,70,949,"Skip the bus and enjoy the hike up to the park at the base of the tower. Have a beer in the rotating restaurant, but don't eat there, and enjoy the panoramic view of the city. Go on one of the rare clear days, or you won't have much of a view.",70,much,"버스를 건너뛰고 타워 기슭에 있는 공원까지 하이킹을 즐기세요. 회전하는 레스토랑에서 맥주를 ​​마시되, 식사는 하지 않고 도시의 탁 트인 전망을 즐기십시오. 보기 드문 맑은 날에 가십시오. 그렇지 않으면 전망이 별로 좋지 않을 것입니다."
71,71,71,957,You get to see a paradomic view of Seoul city at the observatory. View was not spectacular and there wasn't much to do at the tower too.,71,much,전망대에서는 역설적인 서울의 모습을 볼 수 있습니다. 보기는 훌륭하지 않았고 타워에서도 할 일이 많지 않았습니다.
72,72,72,968,"I went there on 21st September, it was windy and cold, I love the weather. But it was foggy too, the view is not clear, we could not enjoy the view that much. I like the souvenir shop and mini mart there, the service received from staffs were so good!",72,much,나는 9월 21일에 거기에 갔다. 바람이 불고 추웠다. 나는 날씨를 좋아한다. 그러나 안개도 껴서 시야가 맑지 않아 그다지 감상할 수 없었습니다. 거기에 기념품 가게와 미니 마트가 있어서 직원들 서비스도 너무 좋았어요!
73,73,73,985,Very easy to get to the tower. The peak has some great views of the city. Other than that not much else to do.,73,much,타워에 도착하기가 매우 쉽습니다. 정상에는 도시의 멋진 전망이 있습니다. 그 외에는 별로 할 일이 없습니다.
74,74,74,987,"This is the first place i go when i arrive in Seoul. Beautiful at night. Went up the tower, nothing much up there, only for the city night view.

75,75,75,993,"When on in the tower, windows were quite dirty so we didn't really get a good view. The outdoor view was definitely much better. There are many restaurants but my favourite was definitely the fried chicken restaurant(really good and spicy)!",75,much,타워에 있을 때는 창문이 너무 더러워서 제대로 된 전망을 볼 수 없었습니다. 확실히 야외 뷰가 훨씬 좋았습니다. 많은 식당이 있지만 가장 좋아하는 것은 확실히 프라이드 치킨 식당이었습니다 (정말 맛있고 매운)!
76,76,76,995,"Walked all the way up to the base of the tower through the park (a gondola is also available, but the walk was maybe 40 minutes and some good exercise).

77,77,77,1001,It is a much better idea to hike to the top and look around the area and then take a bus down again. Do not spend the money getting all the way to the top because there are other ways to see much better views here in Seoul.,77,much,정상까지 하이킹을 하고 주변을 둘러본 다음 다시 버스를 타고 내려가는 것이 훨씬 더 좋은 방법입니다. 여기 서울에서 훨씬 더 나은 전망을 볼 수 있는 다른 방법이 있기 때문에 꼭대기까지 가는 데 돈을 쓰지 마십시오.
78,78,78,1031,"The day we visited was too foggy, so we're not able to see much. It seems we should visit again on a sunny and clear day to enjoy the panoramic view of Seoul.",78,much,우리가 방문한 날은 안개가 너무 껴서 많이 볼 수 없었다. 맑은 날 다시 방문하여 서울의 전경을 감상해야 할 것 같습니다.

You will then take it to the top, you also habe the optiom to hike up. Once you get to the top you can actually see the city and other beautiful things that the tower has to offer. We did not when up to the tower itself because there was so much to see and do. We had the best hot chocolate and they have churros. Best time to go is night time.",81,much,이것은 정말해야합니다. 명동에서 도보로 약 10 분 후에 케이블카 티켓을 구입 한 주요 지역으로 데려다주는 일종의 카드 엘리베이터와 같습니다. 그런 다음 정상으로 가져갈 것이며 하이킹을 선택할 수도 있습니다. 정상에 오르면 도시와 타워가 제공하는 다른 아름다운 것들을 실제로 볼 수 있습니다. 보고 할 것이 너무 많기 때문에 우리는 타워 자체까지 가지 않았습니다. 우리는 최고의 핫 초콜릿을 먹었고 츄러스를 먹었습니다. 가장 좋은 시간은 밤 시간입니다.
82,82,82,1048,"I went when it was raining and cold at night but there were still lot of people.  There isn't much in the tower to see. Shops and dining places are kind of lame. But the Starbucks in there has windows and balcony with.a good view.  After getting there on a cable car, i decided to walk down. I walked pretty briskly and it took less than half an hour to get down to the cable station on the ground level. Pretty dark when I descended in a rainy day and I was a little worried about safety but as I walked down I saw quite a few local couples taking a walk up.  The pathway gives you pretty good view of the city. And the trees along the path make the walk very refreshing. Strongly recommended!",82,much,나는 비오고 추운 밤에 갔지만 여전히 많은 사람들이있었습니다. 타워에는 볼 것이 별로 없습니다. 상점과 식사 장소는 절름발이입니다. 그러나 거기에있는 스타 벅스에는 창문과 발코니가 있습니다. 좋은 전망. 케이블카를 타고 내려온 후 내려오기로 했다. 나는 꽤 빨리 걸었고 지상에 있는 케이블 스테이션까지 내려오는 데 30분도 채 걸리지 않았습니다. 비오는 날 내려올 땐 꽤 어두워서 안전이 좀 걱정됐는데 내려가다 보니 현지 커플들이 꽤 많이 걸어 올라가는 모습을 볼 수 있었다. 통로는 도시의 꽤 좋은 전망을 제공합니다. 그리고 길을 따라 늘어선 나무들은 산책을 매우 상쾌하게 합니다. 권장!

My husband & I decided to take the stairs, all 649 steps. The air was nice & cool, we took our time & most of all, enjoyed the sceneries /view especially at the observation deck.

Or take bus, many routes, cheap as 1250won, also can see beautiful trees when going up, will also pass the walking trail.",87,much,위치가 편리하고 바쁜 쇼핑 지역에서 많은 경로를 이용할 수 있습니다. 케이블카가 가장 빠르고 편하지만 왕복 8000원 정도 비쌉니다. 2가지 방법으로 구매하는 것이 좋고 1가지 방법보다 훨씬 저렴합니다. 명동에서 도보로 무료 에스컬레이터를 타고 케이블카 정류장으로 이동합니다. 또는 버스를 타거나 1250원으로 저렴한 노선도 많고 올라가면 아름다운 나무들도 보이고 산책로도 지나갑니다.

89,89,89,1094,It's a good place to have a night view of the city but the tower observatory level was crowded with people. You could actually enjoy the city night view at Namsan Park if you don't want to pay entrance fee and spending much time to queue up for the observatory.,89,much,도시의 야경을 보기에 좋은 곳이지만 타워 전망대 층은 사람들로 붐볐다. 입장료를 내고 전망대에 줄을 서는 데 많은 시간을 할애하지 않는다면 남산공원에서 도시의 야경을 제대로 즐길 수 있을 것입니다.
90,90,90,1115,"As we realize that most big cities have their own tower, this applies with Seoul as well. Namsan Seoul Tower is located at Namsan Hills where we can see part of Seoul city for the above.  If you happen to have more time in Seoul, please have a chance to visit here. Nothing much to see unless the view of the city, if you are lucky you can have crystal view from the top of the tower but probably you can have haze sometime.",90,much,대부분의 대도시에는 자체 타워가 있다는 것을 알고 있듯이 이는 서울에도 적용됩니다. 남산서울타워는 위와 같이 서울의 일부가 보이는 남산힐스에 위치하고 있습니다. 서울에 더 많은 시간이 있다면 이곳을 방문하십시오. 도시의 전망 외에는 볼 것이 많지 않습니다. 운이 좋으면 타워 꼭대기에서 수정 같은 전망을 볼 수 있지만 언젠가는 안개가 낄 수 있습니다.

92,92,92,1122,My husband and I visited the N Seoul tower on a weekday at around 7pm. We waited about half an hour for the cable car. We were packed in like sardines. Don't expect much from this ride except transportation only. We bought the round ticket. I would recommend only getting a one way ticket. It's quite an easy walk down. It takes about 15-30 mins. There are lots of photo points along the way which the cable car does not offer. Also the wait for the way down was at least 30 mins. It was chaos. We did go up the tower in the elevator. I have to say this part was a waste of money. The views from the first level were amazing. Going up the tower doesn't enhance the view that much. Also it was mayhem in the observation deck. You barely could make it to a window spot and the glass was covered in handprints and smudges. Don't be fooled. The wait for the elevator up was only 15 mins. Coming down was over an hour! Overall tho I would recommend at least going up the cable car. But that's as far as I would go.,92,much,남편과 나는 평일 오후 7 시경 N 서울 타워를 방문했습니다. 우리는 케이블카를 위해 약 30분을 기다렸다. 우리는 정어리처럼 포장되었습니다. 교통편만 제외하고는 이 놀이기구에서 많은 것을 기대하지 마십시오. 우리는 라운드 티켓을 샀다. 편도 티켓만 구입하는 것이 좋습니다. 꽤 쉽게 내려갈 수 있습니다. 15-30분 정도 소요됩니다. 케이블카가 제공하지 않는 길을 따라 많은 포토 포인트가 있습니다. 또한 내려가는 길을 기다리는 시간은 최소 30분이었습니다. 혼돈이었습니다. 우리는 엘리베이터를 타고 타워로 올라갔다. 나는 이 부분이 돈낭비였다고 말하고 싶다. 1층에서의 전망은 훌륭했습니다. 타워에 올라가면 전망이 그다지 좋아지지 않습니다. 역시 전망대에서 난리가 났습니다. 간신히 창가에 갈 수 있었고 유리는 손자국과 얼룩으로 덮여있었습니다. 속지 마세요. 엘리베이터를 기다리는 시간은 단 15분이었습니다. 내려오는데 1시간이 넘게 걸렸다! 전반적으로 적어도 케이블카를 올라가는 것이 좋습니다. 하지만 그것은 내가 갈 것입니다.

(pay attention to group numbers because the lady told me it would be a 2hr 45min wait). after they call your group, it's another long line for the elevator to get up there. once you get up there, there's a ton of people crowding the glass areas, even eating in front of it. it's also very noisy. souvenir shops also take up most of the floor space so ppl don't really have much elbow room. once you're done with taking pictures, yup, there's another long line to get back down. at this point, you can tell everyone is cranky and tired. it's not all bad tho. views were pretty good and there there are plenty of things to do while you wait for your group to be called. make sure to wear comfortable sneakers because this will be a rough one...",94,much,무슨 일이 있어도 서울을 방문할 때 필수 코스입니다. 우리가 처음 도착했을 때 케이블카의 줄이 너무 길어 보도까지 잘 뻗어있었습니다. 우리는 대신 하이킹을 선택했습니다. 쉽지 않다. 거기에 도착하면 표를 올리기 위해 또 다른 긴 줄이 있습니다. 티켓을 받으면 그룹이 호출되기까지 약 2시간이 걸립니다. (여성이 2시간 45분을 기다려야 한다고 말했기 때문에 그룹 번호에 주의하십시오). 그들이 당신의 그룹을 부르고 나면 엘리베이터가 거기에 올라 가기 위해 또 다른 긴 줄입니다. 거기에 올라가면 수많은 사람들이 유리 구역을 가득 채우고 심지어 앞에서 식사를 하기도 합니다. 또한 매우 시끄럽습니다. 기념품 가게는 또한 바닥 공간의 대부분을 차지하므로 ppl은 팔꿈치 공간이 많지 않습니다. 사진 촬영이 끝나면 다시 내려가기 위한 긴 줄이 있습니다. 이 시점에서 모든 사람이 까다롭고 피곤하다는 것을 알 수 있습니다. 다 나쁘지는 않습니다. 보기는 꽤 좋았고 그룹이 호출되기를 기다리는 동안 할 일이 많이 있습니다. 이것은 거친 신발이 될 것이므로 편안한 운동화를 착용하십시오 ...

Pros 1) You get to see Seoul in one site 2) though the cable car is expensive, you can climb up the mountain to reach there 3) have cool performance in the afternoon  Cons 1) Ticket for observation deck is not worth the price. If you wish to go, i recommend you to get combo stuffs. Pay some more and grab some snacks 2) When climbing from Myeongdong, the slope is too high. If your shoes are uncomfy, just take cab or bus up there  Tips If you wish to go for observation deck, i recommend you to look for tickets online. It's nice when you go there at night or during sunset I wouldn't really recommend you to go up to the observation deck as there is nothing much to do up there. There are weekly basis performances and benches just below the tower and it is good enough to have to sight when you are climbing up the mountain.

Once at the top of the tower, you can use coin operated viewing binoculars to view the city surroundings. There are also other photo ops in and around the tower are.

It's optional to go up to the top of the actual tower- we didn't. This is a famous place inasmuch as people fasten padlocks (and a selection of other items such as mobile phone covers!!) to the railings and dispose of the key. Many locks are inscribed with pledges of love. Don't worry if you forget your padlock - you can buy one, and borrow a pen, from a seller at the tower. There are literally hundreds of locks and they in themselves make for interesting photos!",101,much,가파른 언덕을 걷는 것이 매력적이지 않다면 짧은 케이블카를 타고 택시를 탈 수 있습니다. 도시의 전망은 일단 거기에서 인상적입니다. 실제 타워의 꼭대기까지 올라가는 것은 선택 사항입니다. 우리는 하지 않았습니다. 난간에 자물쇠(휴대폰 커버 등)를 걸고 열쇠를 버리는 사람들이 많기로 유명한 곳이다. 많은 자물쇠에는 사랑의 서약이 새겨져 있습니다. 자물쇠를 잊어버렸더라도 걱정하지 마세요. 자물쇠를 사거나 타워에 있는 판매자에게 펜을 빌릴 수 있습니다. 말 그대로 수백 개의 자물쇠가 있으며 그 자체로 흥미로운 사진을 만듭니다!

There were pretty spring flowers blossomed and the weather was good.

It would have been a nice night view but I went in the afternoon and still get to see the city below. As I hop into the cable car, I can't help but think of Lee Min Ho and Goo Hye Sun in Boys Over Flowers when they were trapped there overnight. All the surrounding trees were rather bare and not much flowers in sight at this time, perhaps later after the rain. In the main square there is cultural performance at 3.00pm and I was lucky to catch it. Very enjoyable. There's a small souvenir shop, a couple of coffee outlets, a hamburger place and a few eateries (but they appear to be closed).

Regardless of the experience I have in the cable car, the view up in the N Tower is beautiful and amazing.  Last, beware of touting taxi driver.

We went up to the viewing deck, but this was inside, with glass splattered with rain drops and light reflecting from the various tourist tat sellers - basically not really worth the money, the time as it didn't give a much better view than what we'd seen already and yielded poor quality photos.

I spent less than KRW20000 for a return cable-car ticket, a cup of latte and an ice-cream; and I was done taking photos around the tower in less than an hour. Tips for those who wish not to spend much money there - just power walk to the tower, don't take the cable car :)  The park is very well maintained/kept. The view of Seoul from the outdoor observatory was just breath-taking. The love-locks are pretty to see. There are restaurants/cafes/stalls as well as souvenir shops.

So I reached the cable car entrance amost 2 hrs in advance of my dinner booking. Out of my surprise, I did not need to queue at all, I just went there, bought the ticket, then I could go up to the entrance. I waited only for a few minutes, the cable came.  I thought that the cable car would be kind of individual cabinet, but it is not. It is a big one, no seats, able to accomodate 20-25 persons standing inside.  Cable car should be the best way to go to the Tower. I saw many people coming with big tour bus, and they needed to climb up to the hill. Anyway, after I had arrived, I saw many visitors, most of them are mainland Chinese, not very crowded, but noisy.  There are several gift shops and chain restaurants, but nothing special not buy, nor nothing good to eat here. You could take a lot of pictures with the ""love locks"" if you come with your another half.  There, you could buy the ticket to the observatory which is on the 3rd floor. I do not recommend it, though the elevator is interesting. Nothing much to see in the obvservatory. There are very few souvneirs shops, but trust me, the commodities are not interesting to buy though I was ready to, and intended to buy something.  But still, you could have a lunch / dinner at the korean restaurant.  There is also a chained coffee shop, called TWOSOME+, do not go. There is only one staff, so he is always busy and impatient. He might not be good at English, and when I ordered a drink in English, he misunderstood, and gave me another thing, I requested him to exchange, he became even more impatient and the atitudes were bad !

TWOSOME+라는 체인 커피숍도 있으니 가지마세요. 직원이 한 명뿐이어서 항상 바쁘고 초조합니다. 영어를 잘 못해서 제가 영어로 술을 주문했을 때 잘못 이해해서 다른 걸 줬더니 교환해달라고 했더니 더 초조해 지고 태도가 나빴어요! 커피숍 바로 옆에 위시풀이 있습니다. 나는 거기에서 거의 아무것도 볼 수 없었다. 누가 그런 ""가짜"" 풀에 돈을 던질까요???? 이 지루한 3층에서 1시간을 보낸 후 나는 서비스와 환경, 음식 모두 완벽한 이 놀이기구의 목적지인 5층 N그릴(프랑스 레스토랑)에 갔다. 그곳의 전망은 훌륭합니다. N Grill에서 대부분의 시간을 보내고 싶지 않다면 이 타워에 올라가지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 그리고 가신다면 저녁시간에 드시는게 좋습니다. 야경은 환상적입니다. 그리고 출발하면 낮보다 더 아름다운 밤에 서울타워가 보입니다."

There are a few restaurants and cafés around, with a neat little souvenir shop - be sure to purchase a tile, and be part of the tile wall. Also - buy a padlock and join the hundreds of others to lock your love on the gate surrounding the building.  The snow covered city below was an awesome sight, even though it was bitterly cold outside when we were there - it was completely worth it!!  Definitely worth checking out if you're in Seoul.",123,much,우리는 밤에 서울의 불빛을 확인하기 위해 이곳으로 향했는데 실망시키지 않았습니다. 그것은 꽤 멋진 매력입니다. 당연히 여기에서 할 일이 많지 않습니다(우리가 갔던 시간 - 1월 초). 그러나 보기는 좋습니다. 케이블카를 타는 것은 재미있고 전망대까지 올라가는 엘리베이터는 잘 생각되어 있습니다. 그래픽과 개념은 좋은 아이디어입니다. 주변에 식당과 카페가 몇 군데 있으며 깔끔하고 작은 기념품 가게도 있습니다. 타일을 구입하고 타일 벽의 일부가 되어야 합니다. 또한 - 자물쇠를 구입하고 수백 명의 다른 사람들과 함께 건물 주변의 문에 당신의 사랑을 잠그십시오. 우리가 거기에 있었을 때 밖이 몹시 추웠음에도 불구하고 아래의 눈 덮인 도시는 굉장한 광경이었습니다. 그것은 그만한 가치가 있었습니다!! 서울에 있다면 꼭 확인해볼 가치가 있습니다.
124,124,124,1433,"We reached N Seoul Tower by cable car, which happened to be the most exciting part of the visit to the top. It's definitely not the best/coolest tower I've been too, as CN Tower (Toronto, CAN) still ranks in my top 3. I describe it more as a short tower on a big hill. As well, we couldn't see jack from the view as it was extremely hazy.  There were plenty of activities on the plaza as it was kind of touristy. As we were about to leave the first time, they started setting up for a martial show which turned out to be pretty cool. Other than that, I was ready go. Not much to see, overcrowded, and hazy.  If you're in Seoul, I do recommend you check out the tower. It's kind of like Hollywood, you got to see it once. Maybe you'll have better luck/viewing than we did. Cheers.",124,much,"케이블카를 타고 N서울타워에 도착했는데, 정상 방문의 가장 흥미로운 부분이었다. CN Tower(Toronto, CAN)가 여전히 내 상위 3위 안에 들기 때문에 그것은 내가 가본 것 중 최고/가장 멋진 타워가 아닙니다. 나는 그것을 큰 언덕의 짧은 타워로 더 많이 설명합니다. 또한 매우 흐릿해서 잭을 볼 수 없었습니다. 일종의 touristy이기 때문에 광장에는 많은 활동이있었습니다. 우리가 처음으로 떠나려고 할 때, 그들은 꽤 멋진 것으로 판명된 무술 쇼를 준비하기 시작했습니다. 그 외에는 갈 준비가 되어 있었습니다. 볼거리가 많지 않고 붐비고 흐릿합니다. 서울에 있다면 타워를 확인하는 것이 좋습니다. 한번쯤은 봐야할 헐리우드 같은 영화다. 어쩌면 당신은 우리보다 더 나은 운/관람을 가질 것입니다. 건배."
125,125,125,1435,"From Myeongdong, you can get here by bus. It is also much cheaper compared to riding the cable car. The view is fantastic. No need to get to the top of the tower since the view at the bottom of N Seoul Tower is ok already. Don't forget to check out the namsan locks of love also.",125,much,명동에서 버스로 올 수 있습니다. 또한 케이블카를 타는 것보다 훨씬 저렴합니다. 보기는 환상적입니다. N서울타워 밑에서 내려다보는 뷰가 이미 괜찮아서 탑 꼭대기까지 올라갈 필요가 없다. 남산 사랑의 자물쇠도 놓치지 마세요.

If you like Seoul, you must come to the tower to take a look.",127,much,나는 밤에 거기에 갔고 가시성이별로 없었습니다. 그러나 타워 자체는 아름다웠습니다. 홍콩이나 다른 곳에서 서울보다 야경이 훨씬 좋은 곳이 많아서 뷰가 특별하진 않지만 서울만의 매력이 있어요. 서울을 좋아한다면 타워에 와서 봐야 한다.
128,128,128,1452,Forgot to check weather forecast. Walked all the way from Myeongdong to the cable car station. after travel to the top. Being informed that it is a cloudy day. So if really go up the Tower also might not be able to see much. Another disappointment is the Teddy Bear Museum is closed during winter. T....T  Tips: remember to bring a marker and padlock for leaving the padlock there with your love wishes. :),128,much,일기 예보를 확인하는 것을 잊었습니다. 명동에서 케이블카 정류장까지 걸어갔다. 정상에 여행 후. 흐린 날임을 알려드립니다. 그래서 정말 타워에 올라가면 많이 볼 수 없을 수도 있습니다. 또 다른 실망은 테디베어 박물관이 겨울에 문을 닫는다는 것입니다. T....T 팁: 사랑의 소원이 담긴 자물쇠를 그곳에 두기 위해 마커와 자물쇠를 가져오는 것을 잊지 마십시오. :)
129,129,129,1470,"Actually, there's nothing much to say about N Seoul Tower itself. When we were there, the observatory was too crowded, barely enough space for you to have a view from the top. Restaurants are expensive and even the souvenirs. But what we enjoyed more is the area where people leave locks spreading messages of love especially couples feeling so romantic. You'll see them seated in benches whispering sweet nothings to each other. It was cold and windy that night in September, 2013. Really a good time for couples in love. Another attraction we visited was the Teddy Bear Museum. It was awesome seeing them in all sizes, in different costumes, various themes and some, in action. You really would spend time taking photos not only of these cute bears but photos with them. It was fun. When we were about to leave, there was this light show of the tower itself. So we watched it and enjoyed it although it wasn't extra ordinary. But as a whole, the experience was good.",129,much,"사실 N서울타워 자체에 대해서는 할 말이 별로 없다. 우리가 거기에 있었을 때 전망대는 너무 붐볐고 꼭대기에서 볼 수 있는 공간이 거의 없었습니다. 레스토랑은 비싸고 기념품도 있습니다. 그러나 우리가 더 즐겼던 것은 사람들이 자물쇠를 남겨두고 사랑의 메시지를 전하는 곳, 특히 커플들이 너무 로맨틱하다는 것입니다. 벤치에 앉아 서로에게 달콤한 말을 속삭이는 것을 볼 수 있습니다. 2013년 9월의 그날 밤은 춥고 바람이 많이 불었습니다. 사랑에 빠진 커플에게 정말 좋은 시간이었습니다. 우리가 방문한 또 다른 명소는 테디베어 박물관이었습니다. 모든 크기, 다른 의상, 다양한 주제 및 일부를 실제로 보는 것은 굉장했습니다. 이 귀여운 곰뿐만 아니라 사진을 찍으며 시간을 보낼 것입니다. 재미 있었어요. 우리가 떠날 때 타워 자체의 라이트 쇼가있었습니다. 그래서 우리는 그것을보고 즐겼습니다. 특별하지는 않았지만. 그러나 전반적으로 경험은 좋았습니다."
130,130,130,1475,"The North Seoul tower is an excellent way to get good views of the city. We first travelled to Myeong-dong station (line 4 light blue) & exited on #3 which by luck put us right at the transfer bus ( free) up to the cable car ride to the tower. You just have to wait untill the bus is full before it goes. It runs every half our, so just wait if you think you have missed it. It is a green & yellow mini bus. The cable car is one big car that takes about 20-30 people (which is well legal) & it's KRW8000 for a return trip each adult. Once you arrive at the top of the cable car ride it's a reasonable climb ( a million steps according to my missus) to the tower. By going this way there is no disabled access but you can access the Tower by the Seoul City Tour bus if you are getting around in a wheel chair. Once at the Tower there is a variety of things to look at even if you don't want to go up into the viewing platform. There were performers of different sorts, viewing platform, & shaded trees to sit under. The entrance fee to the top of the tower is KRW9000 each for an adult. I thought it was KRW20000 each but when i bought the tickets it was only KRW18000 for both of us-bargain!!!. The ride to the top of the tower is quick & there is a corny video to watch to take your mind of the ride. The view form the tower is quite good but i would suggest being there on a smog free day or you won't have much to look at. Even when we went it was a very nice day but visibility was about 5-10KM. Plenty of trinkets to buy & there is the usual super imposed photo in front of the tower. Quite easy to dodge that one as we didn't speak Korean.You can spend as much time as you like up there & the ride down is as quick as going up. When you're at the bottom of the tower, check out the padlocks of all the gestures of love. Quite impressive really.",130,much,"북쪽 서울 타워는 도시의 좋은 전망을 얻을 수 있는 훌륭한 방법입니다. 우리는 먼저 명동역(4호선 하늘색)으로 이동했고 운 좋게도 타워까지 케이블카를 타고 가는 환승 버스(무료)에서 바로 우리를 3번 출구로 나왔습니다. 버스가 가득 찰 때까지 기다리기만 하면 됩니다. 그것은 우리의 절반마다 실행되므로 놓쳤다고 생각되면 기다리십시오. 초록색 & 노란색 미니버스입니다. 케이블카는 20~30명 정도 탈 수 있는 대형차로(합법적임) 성인 1인당 왕복 8,000원입니다. 케이블카를 타고 정상에 도착하면 타워까지 가는 합리적인 오르막입니다(나의 부인에 따르면 백만 단계). 이쪽으로 가시면 장애인은 없으나 휠체어를 타고 이동하시면 서울시티투어버스를 타고 타워에 오실 수 있습니다. 타워에 도착하면 전망대에 올라가고 싶지 않더라도 다양한 볼거리가 있습니다. 다양한 종류의 공연자, ​​전망대 및 그늘진 나무 아래에 앉을 수 있습니다. 타워 정상 입장료는 성인 1인당 9,000원입니다. 개당 20000원인줄 알았는데 표를 샀을 때 우리 둘 다 18000원에 흥정!!!. 타워 꼭대기까지의 타는 것은 빠르며 타는 것에 대해 마음을 사로잡을 수 있는 진부한 비디오가 있습니다. 타워의 전망은 꽤 좋지만 스모그가없는 날에 거기에있는 것이 좋습니다. 그렇지 않으면 볼 것이별로 없습니다. 우리가 갔을 때도 날씨가 아주 좋은 날이었지만 시야는 5~10KM 정도였다. 구입할 장신구가 많고 타워 앞에서 일반적인 슈퍼 부과 사진이 있습니다. 우리가 한국어를 말하지 않았기 때문에 그것을 피하기가 매우 쉽습니다. 당신은 거기에서 원하는만큼 많은 시간을 보낼 수 있으며 타는 것은 올라가는 것만 큼 빠릅니다. 탑의 바닥에 있을 때 사랑의 모든 제스처의 자물쇠를 확인하십시오. 정말 인상적입니다."
131,131,131,1487,"Come here in the afternoon just before the sunset the views are amazing and the city comes to life! Watch out if the weather is bad you cannot see that much also on Sunday most offices are closed so the city is not as lit up with the buildings as during the week. Its considered to be a romantic spot so you will see a lot of locals having a romantic stroll around the tower. There are also a lot of restaurants around so you can have a diner and watch the city. Two ways getting there: a cable-cart ride which takes about 4-5 minutes or a walk up, which many locals prefer as its free and healthier rather then the cable-cart. Just after sunset on Sunday while I was there there was a sound and light show on the tower wall which was kind of fun. Highly recommended place and there is a Teddy Bear Museum somewhere close to the tower.... I did not have the time to look for it but I bet its fun as the tower!",131,much,일몰 직전 오후에 여기로 오십시오. 전망이 훌륭하고 도시가 살아납니다! 날씨가 좋지 않으면 일요일에도 대부분의 사무실이 문을 닫아서 도시가 주중만큼 건물로 밝아지지 않도록 잘 볼 수 없습니다. 낭만적 인 장소로 간주되어 타워 주변에서 낭만적 인 산책을하는 많은 현지인을 볼 수 있습니다. 또한 주변에 많은 레스토랑이 있어 식사를 하며 시내를 구경할 수 있습니다. 두 가지 방법으로 가는 방법이 있습니다. 약 4-5분 정도 걸리는 케이블카를 타거나 걸어서 올라가는 방법이 있습니다. 많은 지역 주민들이 케이블카보다 무료이고 건강에 좋다고 선호합니다. 내가 거기에 있는 동안 일요일 일몰 직후 타워 벽에 소리와 조명 쇼가 있었는데 재미있었습니다. 적극 추천하는 곳이고 타워 근처 어딘가에 테디베어 박물관이 있습니다....찾을 시간이 없었지만 타워로서의 재미를 장담합니다!
132,132,132,1490,Locks left by lovers hoping to lock their relationship forever filled the railings of N Seoul Tower. Beautiful sight with benches that are bended in the middle. Great place for photo taking. We took the cable car up and visited the teddy bear museum inside as well. Very cute and informative about the history of Korea during the Joseon and Silla era. We were there during Summer and Korea kind of conserves energy a lot so the place is rather stuffy without much air condition and it's really hot and humid. Try to go when it isn't that cloudy. We went all the way up but it was too cloudy to have a good view of the entire city. Beautiful nonetheless. :),132,much,N서울타워의 난간을 영원히 채우고 싶은 연인들이 남긴 자물쇠. 중간에 구부러진 벤치가있는 아름다운 광경. 사진 찍기 좋은 곳. 케이블카를 타고 올라가 안에 있는 테디베어 박물관도 구경했습니다. 조선과 신라 시대의 한국 역사에 대해 매우 귀엽고 유익합니다. 우리는 여름에 거기에 있었고 한국은 에너지를 많이 절약하기 때문에 공기 조건이 많지 않은 곳은 다소 답답하고 정말 덥고 습합니다. 그렇게 흐리지 않을 때 가십시오. 우리는 모든 길을 갔지만 너무 흐려서 도시 전체를 잘 볼 수 없었습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 아름답습니다. :)

The entire location is based around love and romance so really I recommend couples to go here. If its cloudy its not recommended to go atop the tower, as the clouds often hit the top of the tower but not as much the base. Of course winter is the best time to go as visibility from high places is always better in cold weather.",133,much,꼭대기에 올라가는 것은 약간 비싸고 케이블 카트 티켓을 구입하고 엘리베이터가 타워 꼭대기에 올라야합니다. 꼭대기에 있는 하나는 서울의 경치가 좋은데 밤이 되면 내부 조명이 많이 어두워지지 않고 조명으로 인한 눈부심이 매우 거슬립니다. 하지만 밤에 볼 수 있는 것은 아주 좋습니다. 반면에 작은 산 꼭대기에 있는 기단에서 바라보는 경치도 밤에 아름답고 무엇보다 유리가 없는 것이 가장 좋습니다. 전체 위치가 사랑과 로맨스를 기반으로하므로 커플이 여기에 갈 것을 정말로 추천합니다. 구름이 종종 탑 꼭대기에 부딪히지만 베이스만큼은 아니기 때문에 구름이 낀다면 탑 꼭대기에 올라가는 것은 좋지 않습니다. 물론 겨울이 가장 좋은 시기는 추운 날씨에 높은 곳에서 가시는 것이 언제나 더 좋습니다.

How to go to seoul tower from myungdong ?? cable car or bus. Cable car is about 10 bucks, nice. But you can use a bus all the way to the top of the mountain. Don't be afraid to ask koreans where you can get the bus to seoul tower. Bus fee is much less expensive and fun to experience korean bus, safe and clean..not bad.

137,137,137,1525,"We heard that the lights at night were an amazing sight, but we chose to go there after lunch to see the details of the city. We had lunch first in Myeongdong then walked up going to the cable car. The cable car ride costs KRW6000 for a one-way ticket and KRW8000 for a return ticket. We purchased the one way ticket so we can experience the trail going down the mountain. There was still a bit of a climb going up but there were areas that you can rest, take pictures, buy snacks and enjoy the view.  A major to-do in this site especially for couples is to leave a lock with a love message. You can choose to leave the message in the fence or in metal trees. There really is no rule on how to leave your message -- we saw a lot of curious things attached to the fences such as cellphone cases, lunchboxes, keychains, etc. I already brought a used metal padlock from Manila, but we needed to buy a permanent marker and chose a waterproof bagtag from the souvenir shop to write our message. If you don't have a lock, the souvenir shop sells different colored locks (surely more expensive had you purchased it at your local hardware store).  We bought the bundle package tickets to the Observatory and the Teddy Bear museum (KRW14000/adult). The Teddy Bear museum was a cute way to learn about Seoul's history and the Observatory gives you probably the best panoramic view of Seoul. Near the ticketing area, there's a traditional Korea martial arts demonstration that happens every 3pm. Quite cool to watch.  Going down was a very light hike. This was the same trail you'd take if you will not take the cable car, but judging from the facial expressions of those going up they looked very exhausted halfway up.  The whole experience took about 4 hours to complete, but I'd think some people would probably take much longer if they will choose to eat in the restaurant there.",137,much,"우리는 밤의 불빛이 놀라운 광경이라고 들었지만 우리는 도시의 세부 사항을보기 위해 점심 후에 거기에 가기로 결정했습니다. 우리는 명동에서 먼저 점심을 먹고 케이블카를 타기 위해 걸어 올라갔습니다. 케이블카 이용요금은 편도 6000원, 왕복 8000원입니다. 우리는 산을 내려가는 길을 경험할 수 있도록 편도 티켓을 구입했습니다. 아직 약간의 오르막이 있었지만 쉬고, 사진을 찍고, 간식을 사고, 경치를 즐길 수있는 공간이있었습니다. 이 사이트에서 특히 커플을 위한 주요 할 일은 사랑 메시지가 담긴 자물쇠를 남겨두는 것입니다. 울타리 또는 금속 나무에 메시지를 남기도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 메시지를 남기는 방법에 대한 규칙은 없습니다. 휴대폰 케이스, 도시락 상자, 열쇠 고리 등 울타리에 붙어 있는 신기한 물건을 많이 보았습니다. 마닐라에서 이미 중고 금속 자물쇠를 가져왔지만 우리는 구입해야 했습니다. 영구 마커를 선택하고 기념품 가게에서 방수 가방 태그를 선택하여 메시지를 작성했습니다. 자물쇠가 없으면 기념품 가게에서 다양한 색상의 자물쇠를 판매합니다(현지 철물점에서 구입했다면 확실히 더 비쌌습니다). 우리는 전망대와 테디베어뮤지엄 입장권을 묶음상품권(성인 14000원)으로 구매했다. 테디베어 박물관은 서울의 역사에 대해 배울 수 있는 귀여운 방법이었고 전망대는 아마도 서울 최고의 전경을 제공할 것입니다. 매표소 근처에서 오후 3시마다 열리는 한국 전통 무술 시연이 있습니다. 보기에 아주 시원합니다. 내려가는 것은 매우 가벼운 하이킹이었습니다. 케이블카를 타지 않으면 걷게 될 길과 같았지만, 올라가는 사람들의 표정으로 보아 중도에 지친 모습이었다. 전체 경험은 완료하는 데 약 4시간이 걸렸지만 일부 사람들은 그곳 레스토랑에서 식사를 하기로 선택했다면 훨씬 더 오래 걸릴 것이라고 생각합니다."

144,144,144,1596,"Having been to Tokyo Tower, the N Seoul Tower did not give me the ""wow"" experience when I went up to admire the night scenery. It could be because there wasn't much to look out for when at the top. The view at every angle seemed the same to me. Perhaps it could be better if there was a guide pointing out the landmarks to spot when viewing from a certain part of the tower. The only prominent feature I could identify was probably the Han River.  There are also hourly light shows that will be beamed on the tower itself, starting from 8 pm. But honestly, you can skip it and head straight for the tower. It is nothing fanciful.  The place, like every tourist attraction, is full of people, and waiting time to get up to the viewing gallery can span up to 30 minutes (and that was when I visited on a weekday), so I suggest that you avoid weekends or public holidays, which in my opinion, will take even longer.  TIP: Tower admission fees are 9000 won for adults, but you can enjoy a 10% discount if you use the coupon provided when you purchase a Seoul City Pass Plus (their public transport card, but specially for foreigners) card. It is more convenient to get up there via cable car (8000 won for adults, round trip), but if you want some exercise or just want to take a slow stroll up, by all means!",144,much,"도쿄타워에 다녀온 후 야경을 감상하기 위해 올라갔을 때 N서울타워는 '우와' 하는 느낌을 주지 않았다. 정상에 있을 때 주의할 점이 별로 없었기 때문일 수 있습니다. 어느 각도에서 봐도 다 ​​똑같아 보였다. 타워의 특정 부분에서 볼 때 랜드마크를 안내해 주는 가이드가 있으면 더 좋을 것 같습니다. 내가 식별할 수 있는 유일한 두드러진 특징은 아마도 한강이었을 것입니다. 저녁 8시부터 타워 자체에 빛을 비추는 시간별 라이트 쇼도 있습니다. 그러나 솔직히, 당신은 그것을 건너 뛰고 타워로 곧장 갈 수 있습니다. 그것은 공상적인 것이 아닙니다. 여느 관광지와 마찬가지로 사람이 북적거리고, 관람석까지 웨이팅이 30분(평일에 방문했을 때)까지 오기 때문에 주말이나 공공장소는 피하는 것을 추천한다. 내 의견으로는 더 오래 걸릴 것입니다.

Though a complete tourist trap, if you do want an overview of the hugh metropolis that is Seoul this place is definitely worth a visit. Other than that I do have one more recommendation: Do not miss out on the view from the washroom. (I am speaking for the gents..For a similar experience/view comparable to this, you have to go to the top of a medieval hill town village hundreds of feet above the Mediterranean- Eze, in the Cote d'Azur. The washroom of the restaurant/cafe called the ""golden goat"") While coming down the hill we unwittingly got into a fake taxi that was waiting there to trap foreign tourists. This was the only time in Korea when we got robbed in a cab. (In general our experience with taxis in Korea had been good) A journey to Itaewon that should cost around 5000 won(about $5) turned into ten times as much.( Hint: You try to get into a parked cab. The driver points you to a car behind. You assume that is also a legitimate taxi. It does have a meter. Only one that wouldn't stop jumping for even a split second.

But the hike is very easy - it's reasonably flat and you get pretty good views all the way up. Once at the tower, you need to buy a ticket to go to the observation deck. There is a shopping mall below, so choose to visit that either before or after the observation deck. Then you join the queue, get your photo taken (optional), and then take the lift to the top. Once at the top, there are three different floors full of restaurants and shops.  Tip: If you have Lonely Planet, they have an excellent self-guided walking tour that's very easy to do. It includes a visit to the Old City Wall.  CROWDS It's *so* crowded. Be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes in queues for food, shops, and finding a spot to take photos.  VIEWS Incredible!  Tip: Want to get good views but be away from crowds? We went to the Hancook restaurant where it was VERY quiet. We then sat there, ate slowly, and watched the sunset from our own table in our own space. It's much better then nudging people out of the way on the main floors.  FOOD First we got beer + chips from a coffee shop, and the chips were laughably bad. Then we went and hid in the Hancook restaurant, which was a little overpriced but nice and quiet. We got our own table overlooking the city.  SOUVENIR SHOPPING Some of the best souvenirs I've seen in Seoul! Did all my shopping there.",170,much,"하이킹과 N 서울 타워를 방문하는 하루를 보냈습니다. 찾아가기 예, 케이블카가 있습니다. 그러나 하이킹은 매우 쉽습니다. 상당히 평평하고 올라가는 내내 꽤 좋은 전망을 볼 수 있습니다. 타워에 도착하면 전망대로 가기 위해서는 표를 사야 합니다. 아래에 쇼핑몰이 있으니 전망대 전후에 쇼핑몰을 선택하세요. 그런 다음 대기열에 합류하여 사진을 찍은 다음(선택 사항) 리프트를 타고 정상으로 올라갑니다. 꼭대기에 오르면 레스토랑과 상점으로 가득 찬 3개의 다른 층이 있습니다. 팁: Lonely Planet이 있다면 아주 쉽게 할 수 있는 훌륭한 셀프 가이드 도보 여행이 있습니다. 구시가지 성벽 방문이 포함되어 있습니다. CROWDS *너무* 붐빕니다. 음식, 상점, 사진 촬영 장소를 찾기 위해 10-15분 정도 줄을 서서 기다려야 합니다. 놀라운 조회수! 팁: 좋은 전망을 원하지만 군중에서 멀리 떨어져 있습니까? 우리는 매우 조용한 한쿡 레스토랑에 갔다. 우리는 그 자리에 앉아 천천히 식사를 하고 각자의 공간에 있는 우리 테이블에서 석양을 바라보았다. 메인 층에서 사람들을 방해하는 것보다 훨씬 낫습니다. 음식 먼저 우리는 커피숍에서 맥주 + 칩을 얻었고 칩은 웃기게 나빴습니다. 그런 다음 우리는 조금 비싸지 만 멋지고 조용한 Hancook 레스토랑에 가서 숨었습니다. 우리는 도시가 내려다 보이는 우리 자신의 테이블을 얻었습니다.

This one was a much nicer experience. There is a cafe at the top and you can kind of hang out for a bit. Also, the area at the bottom of the tower was really nice and had great views as well.",171,much,"나는 새로운 장소를 방문할 때 일반적으로 타워를 건너 뛰고 너무 많이 가본 적이 있고 2초 동안 올라갔다가 다시 내려오면서 줄을 서서 기다리는 경향이 있기 때문입니다. 이것은 훨씬 더 좋은 경험이었습니다. 꼭대기에 카페가 있어서 잠시 쉬어갈 수 있습니다. 또한, 타워의 바닥에 있는 지역은 정말 멋졌고 멋진 전망을 가지고 있었습니다."

At first, we were worried that we might get lost going there, but with available online maps, we were able to arrived there so easy and fast just by train and bus. Once in the N Tower, process in going to the view deck is very organized that even too much people were there as it was I guess peak hour (6pm), the piles and waiting took us more or less 30-45mins. The view of the whole Seoul was awesome during the night. There are lots of instagramable picture perfect locations around N Seoul Tower specially those with their loved ones. Surely, would still love to be back to see and enjoy at daytime.",172,much,"N 서울 타워로의 여행은 매우 흥미로웠습니다. 처음에는 길을 잃을까봐 걱정했는데 온라인 지도가 있어서 기차와 버스만 있으면 쉽고 빠르게 도착할 수 있었습니다. N 타워에 도착하면 전망대로가는 과정이 매우 조직화되어 피크 시간 (오후 6시), 더미와 대기 시간이 30-45 분 정도 걸렸을 때 너무 많은 사람들이 거기에있었습니다. 밤에 서울 전체의 전망은 훌륭했습니다. N서울타워 주변에는 특히 사랑하는 사람과 함께 인스타그램에 올릴 수 있는 사진을 찍을 수 있는 장소가 많이 있습니다. 확실히, 여전히 낮에 보고 즐기기 위해 돌아오고 싶습니다."
173,173,173,1953,We visited the tower in the later part of the evening and did not have much of a line at all for the cable car ride up to the tower. The view was beautiful and clear and a little windy. I would definitely recommend this to someone visiting Seoul for the first time. They have a gift shop at the top for you to check out.,173,much,우리는 저녁 늦은 시간에 타워를 방문했고 타워까지 케이블카를 타기 위해 줄이 많이 없었습니다. 보기는 아름답고 맑았고 약간 바람이 불었습니다. 나는 서울을 처음 방문하는 사람에게 이것을 확실히 추천하고 싶습니다. 그들은 당신이 체크 아웃 할 수있는 상단에 선물 가게가 있습니다.
174,174,174,1963,"I was lucky to choose a warm, sunny day in October to visit the North Seoul Tower. Having explored the surroundings under the tower first, I then bought my 10.000 Won ticket and rode the fast lift to the observation deck. The young lady in the lift asked us all to look up to the ceiling of the lift as we started to ascend and the film then took us on a journey much higher than to the top of the Tower - we continued to climb up beyond the earth's atmosphere and into space. Very clever...  At the top I enjoyed stupendous 360° views over the complete city and way beyond. The sky was beautifully clear and you could see for miles and miles. I liked the fact that at one level you could orientate yourself to your home city/country and one level below you could spot the local sights.  The gift shop at the top was well stocked. I really appreciated the chance to buy a postcard or two with the postage stamps already inserted in the envelope. I just needed to buy an extra stamp to cover the postage back to Europe. And there is a postbox at the top of the Tower. All well thought through. Oh, I forgot to say there is free, strong WiFi connectivity up here.  For me, this is a must for any tourist itinerary of this fascinating city.",174,much,"나는 운 좋게도 10월의 따뜻하고 화창한 날을 선택하여 북서울타워를 방문했습니다. 타워 아래를 먼저 둘러본 후 10,000원 ​​티켓을 구입하고 쾌속 리프트를 타고 전망대로 향했습니다. 엘리베이터의 젊은 여성은 우리가 오르기 시작할 때 우리 모두에게 엘리베이터의 천장을 올려다 보라고 요청했고 영화는 우리를 타워의 꼭대기보다 훨씬 더 높은 여행으로 데려갔습니다. 분위기와 공간으로. 아주 영리한... 꼭대기에서 나는 도시 전체와 그 너머의 엄청난 360° 전망을 즐겼습니다. 하늘은 아름답게 맑았고 당신은 몇 마일과 몇 마일을 볼 수 있었습니다. 나는 한 수준에서 당신의 고향 도시/국가로 방향을 잡을 수 있고 한 수준 아래에서 지역 명소를 발견할 수 있다는 사실을 좋아했습니다. 꼭대기에 있는 선물 가게는 잘 갖춰져 있었다. 봉투에 이미 우표가 꽂혀 있는 엽서를 한두 장 살 수 있는 기회를 주셔서 정말 감사했습니다. 유럽으로 돌아가는 우편요금을 충당하기 위해 추가 우표를 사야 했습니다. 그리고 탑 꼭대기에 우체통이 있습니다. 모두 잘 생각했습니다. 아, 여기에 강력한 무료 Wi-Fi 연결이 있다는 말을 잊었습니다. 저에게 이것은 이 매혹적인 도시의 모든 관광 일정에 필수품입니다."

It was so cold and rainy when we visited the place but it still had so much fun.",175,much,타워는 특히 밤에 도시의 멋진 전망을 제공합니다. 담소를 나누며 사진을 찍기에 좋은 곳입니다. 우리가 장소를 방문했을 때 너무 춥고 비가 왔지만 여전히 너무 재미있었습니다.
176,176,176,2009,"This was a perfect way to end my long day, after much sight-seeing around the city. The views from the obsevation deck were magnificent. I would recommend giving it a visit and if you have the extra to spend, go straight to the top.",176,much,이것은 도시 주변에서 많은 관광을 한 후 긴 하루를 끝내는 완벽한 방법이었습니다. 전망대에서 바라보는 풍경은 일품이었다. 나는 그것을 방문하는 것이 좋습니다. 추가 지출이 있다면 바로 정상으로 가십시오.
177,177,177,2016,"N Seoul Tower is a landmark of Seoul because you can pretty much see it from everywhere. And it's just so beautiful! I had the advantage of staying at a hotel with a terrace that was faced right at the tower and every night seeing it was like magic, along with all the city lights. The view from its top is also very beautiful, too bad that we were there on Chuseok and the crowd and huge lines of waiting were exhausting. But still, I do recommend visiting it.",177,much,N서울타워는 서울의 랜드마크다. 어디서든 쉽게 볼 수 있기 때문이다. 그리고 그것은 단지 너무 아름답습니다! 나는 타워 바로 앞에있는 테라스가있는 호텔에 머물 수 있다는 장점이 있었고 매일 밤 그것을 보는 것은 모든 도시의 불빛과 함께 마술과 같았습니다. 정상에서 바라보는 경치도 너무 아름답습니다. 우리가 추석에 거기에 있었던 것이 너무 아쉬워 인파와 엄청난 대기 줄이 지쳤습니다. 하지만 그래도 방문하는 것을 추천합니다.
178,178,178,2030,"We took the cable car up to the top. The price for adult is 9500 KRW for a round trip - rather expensive taking under consideration that you will spend aprox. 1 minute in the cabin and there will be not much to see from it. Then, we got to the top of Seoul Tower, where you can admire AMAZING views and take some neat pictures. However, its next 10000 KRW for an adult. During your trip to the top, you will be obliged to pose for two photos, fortunately, you dont need to purchase them (15000 KRW each, sick!!). On your way down, you will be also ""distilled"" through a gift shop - as the staff is hoping that you will be also tempted to buy some more overpriced things :P  All in all - the beauty of Seoul is here, expensive, but worth it. However, I cannot say I enjoyed the aggresive money extortion during our visit.",178,much,"우리는 케이블카를 타고 정상으로 올라갔다. 성인 요금은 왕복 9500원으로 약 100만원을 소비한다는 점을 감안하면 다소 비싼 편이다. 오두막에서 1분이면 별로 볼 것이 없을 것입니다. 그런 다음 우리는 멋진 전망을 감상하고 멋진 사진을 찍을 수 있는 서울 타워 꼭대기에 도착했습니다. 단, 다음 성인 10000원. 정상에 오르는 동안 두 장의 사진을 찍을 의무가 있지만 다행히 사진을 구입할 필요는 없습니다(각 15,000원, 병!!). 내려가는 길에 선물 가게를 통해 ""증류""될 것입니다. 직원은 당신이 더 비싼 물건을 사고 싶은 유혹을 받기를 바라고 있습니다. 그만한 가치가 있습니다. 그러나 방문하는 동안 공격적인 금품 갈취를 즐겼다고 말할 수는 없습니다."
179,179,179,2032,We went up using a cable car. The place is busy with tourists and has lots of love locks. It has a beautiful view of the city. But nothing much to do so allocate 1-2hrs only in this place. We went up the tower and had a good Korean dinner. The tower is a sight to behold at night.,179,much,우리는 케이블카를 타고 올라갔다. 장소는 관광객으로 바쁘고 많은 사랑의 자물쇠가 있습니다. 도시의 아름다운 전망을 자랑합니다. 그러나 그렇게 할 일이별로 없습니다.이 장소에서만 1-2 시간을 할당하십시오. 우리는 타워에 올라가서 맛있는 한국식 저녁을 먹었다. 타워는 밤에 볼 수있는 광경입니다.
180,180,180,2073,"I went to Namsan Tower twice, both of them on the last week of June. I visited it at night time and on the afternoon the next day afterwards just so that I will be able to witness the night view and day view. The night view was kind of a shame to be honest because it was very foggy so we weren't able to see much of Seoul's skyline. However, the day view was really amazing. Also, Namsan Tower had a lot to offer. I went to the observatory and had the 360 degree view of Seoul. The love locks were great, considering the number of locks that were in there. It was such a shame that I was alone when I came to visit. They also have the hanbok experience which I greatly enjoyed. It's definitely one of the must visit when you're in Seoul.",180,much,"6월 마지막 주에 남산타워에 두 번 갔다. 야경과 낮풍경을 감상하기 위해 야간과 다음날 오후에 방문했습니다. 야경은 안개가 많이 껴서 서울의 스카이라인을 많이 볼 수 없었기 때문에 솔직히 좀 아쉬웠습니다. 그러나, 낮 보기는 정말로 훌륭했다. 남산타워도 볼거리가 많았다. 나는 전망대에 올라 서울을 360도 조망했다. 거기에있는 자물쇠의 수를 고려할 때 사랑의 자물쇠는 훌륭했습니다. 방문할 때 혼자였다는 것이 너무 아쉬웠습니다. 그들은 또한 내가 크게 즐겼던 한복 경험을 가지고 있습니다. 서울에 오면 꼭 방문해야 하는 곳 중 하나입니다."
181,181,181,2103,"For me there are too many people. It is somewhat interesting to get on top and to see Seoul from that hight. But there is not much to do up there. After Lotte Tower was built, this Tower became even less attractive. If you are really interested, you can go one time. But it is not in the top 20 things to do in Seoul. To make it interesting, do the trekking from Botanical Garden or Dongguk University up the hill to the Tower.  Also crowded on weekends like everything else in Seoul.",181,much,나에게는 너무 많은 사람들이 있습니다. 정상에 올라 그 높은 곳에서 서울을 바라보는 것은 다소 흥미롭다. 그러나 거기에는 할 일이별로 없습니다. 롯데타워가 지어진 후 이 타워의 매력은 더 떨어졌다. 정말 관심 있으신 분들은 한 번쯤 가보시면 좋을 것 같습니다. 하지만 서울에서 해야 할 일 20위 안에는 들지 않습니다. 흥미롭게 하려면 식물원이나 동국대학교에서 언덕을 올라 타워까지 트레킹을 해보세요. 서울의 다른 모든 곳과 마찬가지로 주말에도 붐빕니다.
182,182,182,2116,"I went on a Thursday night on a bus (not many people using the bus which was good) around 8 pm. The evening was humid with some light rain. When I got to the bus terminus by the tower, the sky was still clear enough for some good night view of Seoul. By the time I got up the observation deck of the tower, it was very noisy and crowded with people, with loud music playing in the background, and bright light inside which cast strong reflections on the glass. All these kind of ruined the night view and made the visit very unatmospheric. Then mist set in and everything was shrouded. I stayed for a short time and left. I have visited quite a number of high towers in different cities and many offer great views day and night. This is probably the worst experience I have had so far. I guess it would be much better if I go during the day on a weekday when the weather is fine.",182,much,"나는 목요일 밤에 버스 (좋은 버스를 사용하는 사람이 많지 않음)를 오후 8 시경에갔습니다. 저녁은 약간의 비와 함께 습했습니다. 타워 옆 버스 터미널에 도착했을 때 하늘은 여전히 ​​​​맑아서 서울의 야경이 좋았습니다. 내가 타워의 전망대에 올라섰을 때, 그것은 매우 시끄럽고 사람들로 붐볐고, 배경에는 시끄러운 음악이 흘러나오고, 내부는 유리에 강한 반사를 던지는 밝은 빛이 있었습니다. 이러한 모든 종류의 야경은 망쳐 놓았고 방문을 매우 분위기있게 만들었습니다. 그런 다음 안개가 끼고 모든 것이 가려졌습니다. 잠시 머물다 떠났다. 나는 여러 도시에서 꽤 많은 고층 타워를 방문했으며 많은 타워에서 밤낮으로 멋진 전망을 제공합니다. 이것은 아마도 내가 지금까지 경험한 최악의 경험일 것입니다. 날씨가 좋은 평일 낮에 가면 훨씬 좋을 것 같아요."
183,183,183,2137,"The view from all around the tower is great and could not ask for better, however you do not need to actually go up the tower. The surrounding views are great on their own and doesn’t get that much better that it is worth the money. Besides up top is just a massive tourist trap. There are some shops and stuff at the base of the tower that are neat and a Starbucks for your caffeine fix. So overall would make the trip to it again to see the surrounding area but not the top of the tower.",183,much,타워 주변의 모든 곳에서 보는 전망은 훌륭하고 더 나은 것을 요구할 수 없지만 실제로 타워에 올라갈 필요는 없습니다. 주변 전망은 그 자체로 훌륭하며 돈 가치가 있는 만큼 나아지지 않습니다. 게다가 정상은 거대한 관광객 함정입니다. 타워 바닥에는 깔끔한 상점과 물건이 있으며 카페인을 고칠 수 있는 스타벅스가 있습니다. 따라서 전반적으로 주변 지역을보기 위해 다시 여행을 할 것이지만 타워 꼭대기는 볼 수 없습니다.
184,184,184,2138,"There are a lot of cliche things to do in big cities, and visiting their ""tallest buildings"" is one of them. But this was truly a nice experience. From the lush setting to the fabulous views, it is very much worth the trip. Plus, you can take a tram to get to it. As Miranda's mum would say, ""such fun!"" Not only do you get amazing views of the city, but you can send postcards all over the world! They provide the postage. Make sure you have enough memory free on your phone - you will be taking a lot of pictures. Also, right before the elevator to the top of the tower, the staff take a picture of you that you can purchase later. Very expensive and not worth it. I saw signs that said no pictures, but everyone was. They sell popcorn like you are going to the movies, like this is an EVENT. Inside the elevator they play a short clip that you watch on the ceiling. At first I didn't understand why, but it makes sense. How awkward would it be to be crammed in a silent elevator with 10 other people trying not to make eye contact? Great for the whole family. Tons of food options too. Also, if you are with your boo, you can leave a lock on the railings like the French used to do on the Pont des Arts bridge in Paris. Very cute.",184,much,"대도시에는 할 수 있는 진부한 것들이 많이 있으며 ""가장 높은 건물""을 방문하는 것도 그 중 하나입니다. 하지만 이것은 정말 좋은 경험이었습니다. 무성한 환경에서 멋진 전망에 이르기까지 여행의 가치가 매우 높습니다. 게다가 트램을 타고 갈 수도 있습니다. 미란다의 엄마가 말했듯이 ""재미있어!"" 도시의 멋진 전망을 감상할 수 있을 뿐만 아니라 전 세계에 엽서를 보낼 수 있습니다! 그들은 우표를 제공합니다. 휴대전화에 여유 메모리가 충분한지 확인하세요. 사진을 많이 찍게 될 것입니다. 또한 타워 꼭대기로 올라가는 엘리베이터 직전에 직원이 사진을 찍어 나중에 구매할 수 있습니다. 매우 비싸고 가치가 없습니다. 나는 사진이 없다는 표지판을 보았지만 모두가 있었다. 마치 이벤트처럼 영화관에 가듯이 팝콘을 판다. 엘리베이터 안에서 그들은 당신이 천장에서 보는 짧은 클립을 재생합니다. 처음에는 그 이유를 이해하지 못했지만 이해가 됩니다. 10명의 다른 사람들과 눈을 마주치지 않으려고 하는 조용한 엘리베이터에 빽빽이 들어차 있다면 얼마나 어색할까요? 가족 모두에게 좋습니다. 수많은 음식 옵션도 있습니다. 또한 부와 함께라면 프랑스인이 파리의 퐁 데자르 다리에서 했던 것처럼 난간에 자물쇠를 둘 수 있습니다. 아주 귀엽다."

186,186,186,2150,We went there during the day. The view is nice and ok but I flew to Seoul after Tokyo and was much less impressed by the Seoul view (vs Tokyo Sky Tree night view). Maybe at night it would be better. The air around that area was very good and you can have nice walk around for an hour.,186,much,우리는 낮에 거기에 갔다. 보기는 좋고 괜찮지 만 도쿄를 지나 서울로 날아갔고 서울 전망 (vs Tokyo Sky Tree 야경)에 훨씬 덜 감동했습니다. 아마도 밤이 더 나을 것입니다. 그 지역 주변의 공기는 매우 좋았고 한 시간 동안 멋진 산책을 할 수 있습니다.
187,187,187,2151,"It is worth a trip up the tower if it is not too crowded and the queue is long. The city scene up there is nice at night. Actually taking pictures of the city from the park below without the glass window is much better and clearer. But as a tourist, heading up to the tower is just some novelty.",187,much,너무 붐비지 않고 대기열이 길다면 타워 위로 올라갈 가치가 있습니다. 그곳의 도시 풍경은 밤에 좋습니다. 실제로 유리창 없이 아래 공원에서 도시 사진을 찍는 것이 훨씬 더 좋고 선명합니다. 그러나 관광객으로서 타워로 향하는 것은 약간의 진기함에 불과합니다.
188,188,188,2154,"N Seoul Tower is quite OK, but the view is amazing and it was a bit hazy today,the view could have been better (in my opinion). My kid thinks there is nothing much, but we agree that the love locks are interesting, with some dating back to 2006. Overall, a good experience. Might come again.",188,much,"N 서울 타워는 꽤 괜찮습니다. 그러나 보기는 훌륭하고 오늘은 약간 흐릿했습니다. 보기가 더 좋았을 수 있었습니다(제 생각에는). 내 아이는 별 것 없다고 생각하지만, 우리는 사랑의 자물쇠가 흥미롭고 일부는 2006년으로 거슬러 올라간다는 데 동의합니다. 전반적으로 좋은 경험입니다. 다시 올 수도 있습니다."
189,189,189,2155,"Lucked out with no crowds or lines! Cable car up to the base gardens; quite a few stairs, lots of rock walls and stunning views make this outing one of the favourites of Seoul.

Sit and enjoy the cool air or wander around the lush forested area - very much a spectacular spot.",189,much,"군중이나 줄없이 운이 좋았습니다! 기본 정원까지 케이블카; 꽤 많은 계단, 많은 암벽 및 멋진 전망은 이 나들이를 서울에서 가장 좋아하는 것 중 하나로 만듭니다. 합리적으로 맑은 날을 기록하면 전망은 훌륭하고 정원은 장관이며 산책로는 시간을 할애 할 가치가 있습니다. 기념품, 음식, 음료 및 할 일이 많습니다. 앉아서 시원한 공기를 즐기거나 울창한 숲이 우거진 지역을 거닐어 보세요. 아주 멋진 곳입니다."

The overlook of Seoul is really beautiful and romantic during sunset.  We took a circular bus up to N Seoul Tower.

There are no explanations for what you see (maybe a brief history of some key places would be great!), and I think there were no audio guides either. That's why I give this place 2 stars.

199,199,199,2231,"When in Seoul, one must visit the N Seoul Tower because.. ""when in Rome"". I'm rating this a 3/5 because of the challenges my family faced when visiting this landmark:  1. We were travelling with my mum who can't walk much. According to multiple taxi drivers, they were not permitted by law to take passengers up. This meant that Mum had to slowly hike up the hill, and mind you it wasn't the easiest of hills to walk up to.  2. Again, mum couldn't walk much. There was no direct access to the top of the tower. Once we reached the hill and boarded the slanted elevator, there were still a series of stairs to climb to finally make it to the entrance of the tower. It was rather handicap-unfriendly.  3. You'd think that after all that climb, the view would be spectacular but it was pretty average. The entrance free to the viewing deck cost KRW10,000 per person and it was indoor. Perhaps I am biased but I thought The Peak in HK was a lot better, must it was outdoor and far more breath-taking.  4. Getting back down was another challenge as you can imagine.  I would still recommend this for those travelling to Seoul for the first time but probably best to go during the cold weather (otherwise you'd be sweating away), you are wearing comfortable shoes, and are not bounded by toddlers/prams/elderly.",199,much,"서울에있을 때 N 서울 타워를 방문해야합니다...

Went to check it out in Oct, it was great because the weather was good and sunny. We walked slowly up the hill to get on an elevator lift to the tower (free). Then reached mid upper hill had to buy a return ticket (or single one way up or down - can hike up or down the hill) cable ride to the tower. Negative was the staff will filled up the cable car (packed sardines :/) with enough tourists then start the ride. Enjoyed the great views but not really while in the cable car because can't move around to take pictures. When reached the hill top, there were steps to walk up. There was a lock place, where lovers can buy locks to write their wishes and locked it around the fences which was so romantic and a vending machine to sell flowers. After had to walk up few more steps up and there was a Korean dressed up guard standing there and behind 2 more guards were marching each side of the huge big vases (those were for guards to lit those big vases when enemies entered their provinces -old time). Because it was mid autumn festival, there was a stall that let visitors to put on Korean traditional costumes (free) then took pics with the guards. At the tower, visitors able to buy just visit the tower platform, or tickets that include hello kitty museum and comic characters museum. Both museums are small but kids loved them so much. Up to the viewing plateform, the views were magnificent and spent long time to see how Seoul formed. Seoul was surrounded by mountains, palaces were along those mountains, buildings were not tall and able to see the new develop areas and old areas. Slight dissapointed - did not have places to sit and no much service facilities if compared with Lotte world tower (from namsan world tower you can see the Lotte world tower is right opposite to each other). The ladies toilets have glass all the way down in the cubicles but abit smelly and not clean.

The cart ride isnt great so if i was to do it again i would just get the bus up.  Once you get to the base of the tower its then more money to get up.

Enjoy!,220,much,우리는 전 세계의 많은 타워에 있었고 이것은 아마도 우리를 가장 흥분시켰을 것입니다. 당신은 도시의 좋은 전망을 가질 수 있지만 아마도 맑은 하늘 날의 일몰 시간은 훨씬 더 좋을 것입니다. 언덕을 오르는 것을 피하기 위해 가장 가까운 지하철역에서 무료 셔틀 버스가 있습니다. 정보는 호텔에 문의하십시오. 케이블카 비용은 8500이고 타워 티켓은 또 다른 10000입니다. 거의 20 USD/per - 어쩌면 조금 너무 많은... 즐기십시오!
221,221,221,2607,"I had read that the activities around the tower were fun, so we went up to the tower even though it was raining and overcast. Maybe the activities would be fun for a small child, but I was not entertained. The toy museum and the hello kitty museum just looked kind of pathetic from the outside, so we didn't pay to go in those. The arcade was sad, mostly claw machines (we had already experienced a claw machine arcade and lost several thousand won because the claw jolts too much).",221,much,타워 주변에서 하는 액티비티가 재미있다고 해서 비가 오고 흐려도 타워에 올라갔다. 활동이 어린 아이에게는 재미있을지 모르지만 나는 즐겁지 않았습니다. 장난감 박물관과 헬로키티 박물관은 겉에서 보기에 한심해 보였기 때문에 입장료를 내지 않았습니다. 아케이드는 대부분 클로머신이여서 아쉬웠습니다.
222,222,222,2617,"The view from the top of N Seoul Tower is amazing and the cable car ride up is also stunning! From Myeongdong station, it's not a long walk to the cable car station, though it is all uphill with a decent set of stairs at the end. There is also a shuttle bus from Myeongdong station to the cable car but we just walked. N Seoul Tower should definitely be done at night, when the tower is lit up and so is all of Seoul. One of the most amazing things about the tower is definitely the bathrooms, make sure you pay them a visit before you head back down! We didn't spent long at the top, it's actually a pretty small area, there is a small gift shop and lolly shop, however the gift shop at the base of the tower has a much better range.",222,much,"N서울타워 정상에서 바라보는 경치도 일품이고 케이블카를 타고 올라가는 모습도 멋집니다! 명동역에서 케이블카 정류장까지는 그리 오래 걸리지 않지만 끝에는 괜찮은 계단이 있는 오르막길입니다. 명동역에서 케이블카로 가는 셔틀버스도 있지만 우리는 그냥 걸어갔다. N서울타워는 당연히 밤에 해야 하고, 타워에 불이 켜지면 서울 전체도 마찬가지입니다. 타워에 대한 가장 놀라운 점 중 하나는 확실히 욕실입니다. 다시 내려가기 전에 반드시 화장실을 방문하세요! 우리는 정상에서 오래 시간을 보내지 않았습니다. 실제로 꽤 작은 지역입니다. 작은 선물 가게와 사탕 가게가 있지만 타워 아래에 있는 선물 가게는 훨씬 더 좋은 범위를 가지고 있습니다."
223,223,223,2634,"Our hotel has a shuttle that dropped us off at the cable car so we decided to take that up to the tower. Also because some family members did not wear appropriate shoes... It was earlier in the morning so no line at all. The cable car ride only took about 10 minutes. You're in between trees so the view is just ok. I would have preferred to walk up and recommend it for anyone who is capable and willing.  Walking around underneath the tower, there were some areas with ok views. Unfortunately it was a little smoggy that day so you can't see very clearly for long. We got a couple ice cream cones and sat in the back with tables and panoramic glass window looking towards Gangnam. Unfortunately the would be relaxing experience was many times ruined by people dragging chairs across the concrete that creates the most horrific high pitched sound.  Given the less than ideal visibility, we didn't pay additional to go up to the top of the tower. I think if the weather was better, especially if you have a clear night, that would have been much nicer.",223,much,"우리 호텔에는 케이블카에서 우리를 내려주는 셔틀이 있으므로 우리는 그것을 타워까지 가져 가기로 결정했습니다. 그리고 몇몇 가족들이 신발을 제대로 신지 않아서.. 이른 아침이라 줄은 전혀 서지 않았다. 케이블카를 타는 데 걸리는 시간은 10분 남짓. 당신은 나무 사이에 있으므로보기는 괜찮습니다. 나는 걸어가서 능력과 의지가 있는 사람에게 그것을 추천하는 것을 선호했을 것입니다. 타워 아래를 돌아 다니며 괜찮은 전망을 가진 일부 지역이있었습니다. 불행히도 그날은 약간 스모그가 있어서 오랫동안 선명하게 볼 수 없었습니다. 우리는 몇 개의 아이스크림 콘을 가지고 테이블과 강남을 바라보는 탁 트인 유리창이 있는 뒤쪽에 앉았습니다. 불행히도 가장 끔찍한 고음 소리를 생성하는 콘크리트를 가로 질러 의자를 끄는 사람들로 인해 편안한 경험이 여러 번 망쳤습니다. 시야가 이상적이지 않다는 점을 감안할 때 우리는 타워 꼭대기까지 올라가기 위해 추가 비용을 지불하지 않았습니다. 날씨가 더 좋았더라면, 특히 밤이 맑았더라면 훨씬 더 멋졌을 것 같아요."
224,224,224,2640,I decided to walk up and even tho I was lost 1 hour b4 I found the right path I do not regret this site! I walked from my hotel and it was worth the walk. There is lots of stairs up to where the tower is. You can definitely walk. I am not that athletic but it was ok to walk up. I rested few times. There was a place to take pictures half way up....good place to rest your tired legs. Don't forget to bring water!! When I was up there the tower is....i decided NOT to go up on the tower. Bcuz the wiew was so awesome at where I was that the tower it self was not needed. Ofc for those that want to go up to the tower....its worth it I am sure....but I just sat there on til of that mountain...under the tower and watched ppl and the wiew. That was one of my best moments in Seoul...so lovely! I drank coffee at the cafe and the wiew was like a dream! I warmly recommend this experience! I walked down the mountain too....it was much easier to go down 😊,224,much,나는 걸어가기로 결정했고 1시간 동안 길을 잃었지만 b4 나는 올바른 길을 찾았습니다. 이 사이트를 후회하지 않습니다! 나는 나의 호텔에서 걸었다. 그리고 그것은 걸을 가치가 있었다. 타워가 있는 곳까지 계단이 많이 있습니다. 당신은 확실히 걸을 수 있습니다. 운동을 잘하는 편은 아니지만 걸어서 올라가도 괜찮았어요. 나는 몇 번 쉬었다. 중간에 사진찍을 수 있는 곳이 있었는데....피곤한 다리를 쉴 수 있는 좋은 곳. 물 가져오는거 잊지마세요!! 내가 거기에 있었을 때 타워는 .... 타워에 올라가지 않기로 결정했습니다. Bcuz는 타워 자체가 필요하지 않을 정도로 내가 있었던 곳에서 너무 굉장했습니다. 타워에 올라가고 싶은 사람들을 위한 Ofc....그만한 가치가 있다고 확신합니다....하지만 저는 그냥 그 산까지 거기에 앉아서...타워 아래에서 ppl과 wiew를 보았습니다. 그것은 서울에서 최고의 순간 중 하나였습니다...너무 사랑스럽습니다! 카페에서 커피를 마셨는데 꿈만 같았어요! 나는이 경험을 따뜻하게 추천합니다! 저도 산을 내려왔는데.... 내려오기가 훨씬 수월했어요 😊
225,225,225,2650,"My wife and I went to the Tower in the evening for 2 reasons - eat at the N Grill restaurant on the top floor and see the views. Luckily we had a sunny evening so we were treated to stunning views of the sunset over Seoul. You are very high up and so the views are amazing. I thought the Observatory Deck was pretty much the only attraction but I was really surprised to see that there is actually quite a bit to see and do there with a lot of shops on each floor. So I recommend you allow for about 2 hours of time there. Getting there is very easy, cable car or a bus. If by bus, take the number 2 bus from Chungmuro Station (outside the cinema) and it takes about 20 minutes to the Tower stop. From there it's a five minute walk uphill to the Tower.",225,much,"아내와 나는 두 가지 이유로 저녁에 타워에갔습니다. 최상층에있는 N Grill 레스토랑에서 식사를하고 전망을 봅니다. 운 좋게도 우리는 화창한 저녁을 보냈기 때문에 서울의 일몰의 멋진 전망을 볼 수 있었습니다. 당신은 매우 높아서 전망이 훌륭합니다. 전망대가 거의 유일한 어트랙션인 줄 알았는데, 층마다 정말 볼거리, 즐길거리가 꽤 많고 가게도 많다는 사실에 정말 놀랐습니다. 따라서 약 2시간 정도의 시간을 허용하는 것이 좋습니다. 가는 방법은 케이블카나 버스로 매우 쉽습니다. 버스의 경우 충무로역(영화관 밖)에서 2번 버스를 타고 타워 정류장까지 약 20분 소요됩니다. 거기에서 타워까지 오르막길로 5분이 소요됩니다."

On the way back our guide took us to the park below the tower. They have hundreds of colorful locks with names on them (professing eternal love). And of course we left one (we are told they are periodically removed). A few steps away, we dressed up on the traditional Korean costumes....overall, a very nice experience.",230,much,우리는 아침에 거기에 갔고 맑았음에도 불구하고 약간 흐릿했습니다. .. 그럼에도 불구하고 우리는 전망 (360도)을 매우 즐겼습니다. 돌아오는 길에 가이드는 우리를 타워 아래의 공원으로 데려갔습니다. 그들은 이름이 새겨진 수백 개의 다채로운 자물쇠를 가지고 있습니다(영원한 사랑을 고백함). 그리고 물론 우리는 하나를 남겼습니다(우리는 그것들이 주기적으로 제거된다고 들었습니다). 몇 걸음 떨어져서 우리는 한국의 전통 의상을 입었습니다....전반적으로 아주 좋은 경험이었습니다.

234,234,234,2739,The tower provide a stunning view of Seoul.  But I personally think that it is unnecessary to enter the observation area. You have to pay like KRW 8000 for the entrance. And the view is pretty much the same with view you can get on lower level.,234,much,타워는 서울의 멋진 전망을 제공합니다. 하지만 개인적으로 전망대에 들어갈 필요는 없다고 생각합니다. 입장료는 8000원 정도 내야 합니다. 그리고 보기는 낮은 수준에서 얻을 수 있는 보기와 거의 동일합니다.
235,235,235,2743,"We enjoyed the walk up to the base of the tower. Once at the base, we enjoyed the limited views (due to pollution) and felt that we wouldn't gain much by going up the tower. The entrance fee is overpriced if the view is limited. We got great views a few days earlier from a mountain in bukhansan park. Walk up only took 20 mins.",235,much,우리는 타워 기슭까지의 산책을 즐겼습니다. 일단 기지에 도착했을 때 우리는 제한된 전망(오염으로 인해)을 즐겼고 탑을 올라가도 많은 것을 얻지 못할 것이라고 느꼈습니다. 전망이 제한된 경우 입장료가 비쌉니다. 우리는 며칠 전에 북한산 공원의 산에서 멋진 전망을 얻었습니다. 올라가는데만 20분이 걸렸다.

We took bus No 5 from Myeongdong. Cars and taxis are no longer allowed past a certain point. So the recourse is to go by bus or cable car. I'm glad we didn't take the cable car for the queue going back down was insanely long. The bus brings you right up to the base of the tower. This tower should be nicknamed Seoul's or Namsan's Love Lock Tower.

The tower in itself is very much typical for these sort of attractions. The first level (5F) is very nice with a good view , some restaurants and shops and plenty of opportunities to take pictures. You will need to pay 10000 KEW to go to the top. It is recommended as there is a nice view. A little expensive for teh offereing. Worth going",238,much,걸어서 케이블카를 타고 내려갔다. 나는 이 길을 추천합니다. 공원에서 멋진 산책을 할 수 있을 것입니다. 특별하지는 않지만 가치가 있습니다. 타워 자체는 이러한 종류의 관광 명소에 매우 일반적입니다. 1층(5F)은 전망이 매우 좋고 레스토랑과 상점이 있으며 사진을 찍을 기회가 많습니다. 정상에 오르려면 10000KEW를 지불해야 합니다. 전망이 좋아서 추천합니다. teh 제공을 위해 조금 비싸다. 갈 가치

It is advisable to go very early during the day if you want to head up to the N Seoul Tower as it can be very crowded. We walked to the ticket office, and the walk up isn't too bad. Waiting time for a ticket is about 30 minutes. Then another 30-45 minutes to the cable car. If you are super fit you can walk up to the N Seoul Tower, otherwise the walk up is not for the faint hearted. When we arrived at the ticket box there was an ambulance collecting someone that had collapsed from the walk. Once you get up to the tower there is a lot to do- shops, eateries, children's activities, marital arts demonstrations and much more. We stayed here for about 3 hours and then walked down. It was about 20 minutes walk down, but you felt sorry for the people walking up, as it is a long walk. This is a must see when in Seoul.",240,much,"이것은 인기있는 관광 명소이므로 사전 계획을 적극 권장합니다.

242,242,242,2782,"As a tourist my friend and I were told we had to go here and I'm glad we did! The tower offers a variety of attractions and although we never made it inside it just shows how much there is to do. We got to the tower by taking the subway to Seoul station and left through exit 9. We then walked a short distance forward and the shuttle bus stand was there where we took a shuttle bus straight to the park. Other ways include the subway to Myeongdong and a cable car. You can't take a taxi or a car there as they are trying to reduce the pollution to protect the area.  Once at the location you walk up a HILL to get to the actual tower. Wear good shoes guys! There is lots to do there before even paying to get in the tower (which happened to us because of time constraints). There were different dances and sword fighting displays with a running commentary of South Koreas historical background. This is offered in both Korean and English. They include the audience quite a lot which is great fun! I found myself laughing at the comedic side of it!  There is lots to eat ranging from lunch to dessert and snacks so you won't go hungry.  The iconic love locks are also there. For 8000 won you can buy one or 12000 won you can buy a set of two locks, both come with a free marker pen. You then go to write whatever you want and lock it up on the tower forever! Its an amazing thing to do as it feels like you're leaving a part of yourself in Seoul.  This was all done without paying an entrance fee to get into the tower. Unfortunately we never made it inside due to time constraints but that shows there's a lot of fun stuff to do! Definitely visit there, just give yourself a good amount of time.",242,much,"관광객으로서 내 친구와 나는 우리가 여기에 가야한다고 들었고 우리가 해서 기쁩니다! 타워는 다양한 볼거리를 제공하며 우리는 내부에 들어가보지는 않았지만 해야 할 일이 얼마나 많은지 보여줍니다. 서울역에서 지하철을 타고 타워에 도착한 후 9번 출구로 나와 조금 걸어가니 셔틀버스 정류장이 있어서 바로 공원까지 셔틀버스를 탔습니다. 다른 방법으로는 명동행 지하철과 케이블카가 있습니다. 그 지역을 보호하기 위해 오염을 줄이려고 하기 때문에 택시나 자동차를 탈 수 없습니다. 위치에 도착하면 실제 타워에 도착하기 위해 언덕을 올라갑니다. 좋은 신발 신으세요 여러분! 타워에 들어가기 위해 비용을 지불하기 전에 할 일이 많이 있습니다 (시간 제약으로 인해 우리에게 일어났습니다). 한국의 역사적 배경에 대한 해설과 함께 다양한 춤과 칼 싸움이있었습니다. 한국어와 영어로 제공됩니다. 그들은 청중을 상당히 많이 포함하여 큰 재미를 선사합니다! 코믹한 면에서 웃음이 나는 저를 발견했습니다! 점심부터 디저트, 안주까지 먹을거리가 많아 배고프지 않습니다. 상징적인 사랑의 자물쇠도 있습니다. 8000원에 1개를 살 수 있고 12000원에 2개 세트를 살 수 있으며 둘 다 무료 마커 펜과 함께 제공됩니다. 그런 다음 원하는 것을 작성하고 타워에 영원히 가두십시오! 서울에서 자신의 일부를 떠나는 것처럼 느끼기 때문에 놀라운 일입니다. 이 모든 것은 타워에 들어가기 위해 입장료를 내지 않고 이루어졌습니다. 불행히도 우리는 시간 제약으로 인해 내부에 들어가지 못했지만 할 일이 많다는 것을 보여줍니다! 확실히 거기를 방문하십시오. 충분한 시간을 가지십시오."

Pay some money again for the tower and on the top is kinda small. Comparing with Tokyo skytree or Tokyo tower, they seem to have more to offer.

We had a cup of coffee to warm ourselves up before going to the top point of the tower. There are several shops and restaurants there but unfortunately, one of the store owners (located on the first floor) selling accessories and souvenirs was not friendly. Nevertheless, we didn't let this affect our mood. The scenery at the top is so beautiful. It was nice and we bought quite a few souvenirs from the store there. We also visited the Hello Kitty Island located on the first floor which is so adorable. We all love Hello Kitty & Friends. We spent about an hour there taking pictures. My kids enjoy it so much and have been sharing with their daddy (who missed it) since then lol...he is so jealous about it. We will be going there again (and with daddy this time of course)!",247,much,2016년 12월쯤에 아이들과 함께 다녀왔습니다. 버스를 타고 갔는데 추운 날씨에 오르막길을 오르는 것이 상당히 지루했습니다. 우리는 탑의 꼭대기에 가기 전에 몸을 녹이기 위해 커피 한 잔을 마셨습니다. 여러 상점과 레스토랑이 있지만 불행히도 액세서리와 기념품을 판매하는 상점 주인(1층에 위치) 중 한 명이 친절하지 않았습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 우리는 이것이 우리의 기분에 영향을 미치지 않도록 했습니다. 정상에서 바라보는 풍경이 너무 아름답습니다. 그것은 멋졌다. 그리고 우리는 거기의 가게에서 꽤 많은 기념품을 샀다. 너무 사랑스러운 1층에 위치한 헬로키티 아일랜드도 방문했습니다. 우리 모두는 Hello Kitty & Friends를 사랑합니다. 우리는 사진을 찍는 데 약 1 시간을 보냈습니다. 내 아이들은 그것을 너무 즐기고 그 이후로 아빠와 공유하고 있습니다. 우리는 다시 거기에 갈 것입니다 (물론 이번에는 아빠와 함께)!
248,248,248,2866,The tower is easily accessible. If you don't like to walk the cabs and buses can drop you in frunt of cable car. Otherwise there is a scenic walking path. The scenic beauty is due to cherry blossom trees planted all around the tower. I visited in March. Cherry blossom bloom around april. Unfortunately there was not much to see. If you are visiting in winters . Give the place a miss. View is worth it during spring.,248,much,타워에 쉽게 접근할 수 있습니다. 택시와 버스를 걷는 것을 좋아하지 않는다면 케이블카 앞에서 내려줄 수 있습니다. 그렇지 않으면 경치 좋은 산책로가 있습니다. 아름다운 경치는 타워 주변에 심어진 벚나무 때문입니다. 3월에 방문했습니다. 벚꽃은 4월경 만개합니다. 불행히도 볼 것이 많지 않았습니다. 당신이 겨울에 방문하는 경우. 장소를 놓치지 마세요. 봄에는 볼 가치가 있습니다.

Even though the cable car service was quite organized, there was a long line and we had to wait for about half an hour before we could go up. The way up was nice and I got a lot of cool videos and pictures.  We didn't have time to explore the ground floor of the tower (I did see a hello kitty store tho) but Im pretty sure there were a couple of restaurants or cafes down there. We quickly discovered that you also had to pay to actually go up in the tower which was annoying (since we had already payed for the cable car) but it didn't cost that much. We also had to wait in line to get to the elevator, maybe 15 minutes or so. The view is very pretty once you actually get up. You can see the whole city!! Everybody was taking pictures but the windows till didn't get too crowded. There was a candy store and a souvenir shop on the inner side, I didn't buy anything but there was a wide range of different goods. Overall the trip was fun. I've been to Burj Khalifa so it wasn't that mind-blowing for me but you got a cool view :) We decided to walk down but you can obviously also take the cable car. I think our experience would have been much nicer in the summer, when it's warm and the plants are green. I do recommend coming to the tower... but maybe not in the winter.  *visited with my dad*",250,much,케이블카를 타거나 도보로 타워에 올라갈 수 있습니다. 걸어가려고 했는데 마땅한 길을 찾지 못해 케이블카를 탔다. 케이블카 서비스가 꽤 조직적이었음에도 불구하고 줄이 길어서 30분 정도 기다려야 올라갈 수 있었습니다. 올라가는 길은 좋았고 멋진 비디오와 사진을 많이 얻었습니다. 우리는 타워의 1 층을 탐험 할 시간이 없었지만 (나는 헬로 키티 가게를 보았지만) 아래에 두 개의 레스토랑이나 카페가 있다고 확신합니다. 우리는 성가신 (우리가 이미 케이블카 비용을 지불했기 때문에) 타워에 실제로 올라가기 위해 비용을 지불해야했지만 그렇게 많이 들지 않는다는 것을 빨리 발견했습니다. 우리는 또한 엘리베이터에 도착하기 위해 줄을 서서 기다려야 했습니다. 아마도 15분 정도였습니다. 실제로 일어나면 뷰가 너무 예뻐요. 도시 전체를 볼 수 있습니다!! 모두가 사진을 찍고 있었지만 창문이 너무 혼잡하지 않을 때까지. 안쪽에는 사탕가게와 기념품가게가 있었는데 아무것도 사지 않았지만 다양한 상품들이 있었습니다. 전반적으로 여행은 재미있었습니다. 나는 부르즈 칼리파에 가본 적이 있어서 그렇게 인상적이지는 않았지만 멋진 경치를 볼 수 있었습니다. :) 우리는 걸어서 내려가기로 했지만 분명히 케이블카를 탈 수도 있습니다. 나는 우리의 경험이 따뜻하고 식물이 녹색인 여름에 훨씬 더 좋았을 것이라고 생각합니다. 나는 타워에 오는 것을 추천하지만 아마도 겨울에는 아닐 것입니다. *아빠와 함께 방문했습니다*
251,251,251,2914,Didn't go all the way to the top as was too late for it. But pretty sure that I wouldn't spend that much with 4 of us just to go a bit more to the top.

The first time was during evening time and my friend and I took the bus to get to the place of which we continued by walking uphill to get to the main area which was quite an exercise haha! The view was really beautiful during evening/night time and I was so overwhelmed with everything that I had tears in my eyes (yes that dramatic haha) but of course, do expect a bit more crowd during night time.  Second time my friend and I went there during noon time on a weekend so we waited for as long as 2 hours to get to the cable car and everything. Make sure you plan well and avoid the weekends as much as possible if you're planning to visit Namsan Tower. However, day time visit offers a different view and better overall experience so it really depends on what you're looking for.

I went on a Monday and there weren't a lot of people so I was able to enjoy the view.  To get here, get off at Myeongdong station.

269,269,269,3160,"Perhaps it was my poor experience at the buffet restaurant (HanCook), the long wait at the Namsan cable car station, or getting ripped off by taxi drivers at the Namsan cable car station taxi stop - that led me to such a poor rating.  N Seoul Tower is one of your typical observation towers among its brethren - e.g. Space Needle, CN Tower, Calgary Tower, etc. And like these other observation towers, they do provide nice views of the city (probably the best time to arrive to these towers is a little before sunset) at a steep cost.  My first annoyance was the shuttle that they provide from Myeondong (line 1) is very confusing. I waited at the stop and the Namsan Cable Car station shuttle came by. My original intention was to take the bus directly to the tower as it was cheaper than the cable car and I heard not so positive reviews of the cable car. The bus driver, who was clearly English deficient or purposely deceitful, told me I was in the correct bus - then promptly dropped me off at the cable car station. I have to imagine that this is a scam, as you then have no other alternative to get to the tower other than using the cable car. The cable car cost is approximately $7.50 USD vs app. $2 USD for the bus ride. So I relented to buy tickets, only to have to wait around 30-45 minutes for a chance to ride the cable car up (be aware of the Disney-like lines which hide the true wait time).  The cable car itself was standing room only. The views going up were a bit disappointing and IMHO not worth the extra $5.50 USD. You can see a nice view of Myeongdong, but you don't get that super wide panoramic view of the other parts of Seoul. The ride is short as well - app. 3 minutes!  I arrived a little after sunset, so that may have tempered my opinion of the place as the views were much more limited at that time. You do have views of various areas of Seoul, as well as an area where people chained these love locks to a fence (similar to a bridge in Seattle), various restaurants, souvenir shops, etc. I didn't realize the Alive Museum is there (I went to the one in Jeju and wasn't too impressed).  We decided to purchase dinner for HanCook restaurant, the buffet restaurant at the tower for approximately $88 USD for two. The only nice thing about this is that the price includes a trip to the top of the tower. I have a separate review of the restaurant, but I can easily summarize the restaurant as terrible. I was able to walk around the tower after dinner - there isn't too much unique to see in the tower itself. We then took a walk around the area at the base of the tower - and again, there isn't much unique to see in terms of shops or restaurant.  We took the cable car back down - the wait was much less. The trip down was uneventful. However, I arrived back at the cable car station base a little after 8:30 PM and unfortunately, the last bus to Myeongdong departs at 8:30 PM! Obviously, the cable car station ticket office doesn't warn you about this. Accordingly, you are left to the wolves - in this case, the taxi drivers. I didn't want to walk back to Myeongdong so I approached a taxi driver for a ride back to Myeongdong. The taxi driver immediately indicated it would cost me a 20000 won rate up front, $17 USD for essentially driving less than a few miles (and actually, Myeongdong is literally only a mile or two away from the Namsan cable car station)! I should have called an UberBlack car at that time instead of taking the taxi... But the lesson is - beware of the Seoul taxi drivers!  Anyway, N Seoul Tower should probably low on your priority list of Seoul attractions as there are many other worthwhile attractions to go to.",269,much,"아마도 뷔페 레스토랑(한쿡)에서의 형편없는 경험, 남산 케이블카 정류장에서의 오랜 기다림, 또는 남산 케이블카 정류장 택시 정류장에서 택시 기사들에게 속아서 - 그것이 나를 그렇게 나쁜 평가로 이끌었습니다. N 서울 타워는 형제들 사이에서 전형적인 전망대 중 하나입니다. 스페이스 니들, CN 타워, 캘거리 타워 등. 그리고 이러한 다른 전망대와 마찬가지로, 그들은 비싼 비용으로 도시의 멋진 전망을 제공합니다(이 타워에 도착하는 가장 좋은 시간은 일몰 전일 것 같습니다). 내 첫 번째 성가심은 명동 (1 호선)에서 제공하는 셔틀이 매우 혼란 스럽습니다. 정류장에서 기다리니 남산케이블카 정류장 셔틀이 왔다. 원래 의도는 버스가 케이블카보다 저렴해서 타워까지 직행하는 것이었고 케이블카에 대한 긍정적 인 리뷰를 듣지 못했습니다. 분명히 영어가 부족하거나 의도적으로 기만적인 버스 기사는 내가 올바른 버스를 탄 것이라고 말한 다음 즉시 케이블카 정류장에서 나를 내려주었습니다. 케이블카를 사용하는 것 외에 타워에 도착할 수 있는 다른 대안이 없기 때문에 이것이 사기라고 생각해야 합니다. 케이블카 비용은 앱에 비해 약 $7.50 USD입니다. 버스를 탈 때 $2 USD. 그래서 나는 표를 사기로 결심했고 케이블카를 탈 기회를 얻기 위해 약 30-45분을 기다려야만 했습니다. 케이블카 자체는 스탠딩 룸이었습니다. 올라가는 전망은 약간 실망스러웠고 IMHO는 추가 $5.50 USD의 가치가 없습니다. 명동의 멋진 전망은 볼 수 있지만 서울의 다른 지역은 그렇게 넓은 파노라마를 볼 수 없습니다. 이동 시간도 짧습니다 - 앱. 3 분! 나는 일몰 후에 조금 도착했는데, 그 당시에는 보기가 훨씬 제한적이었으므로 장소에 대한 나의 의견을 누그러뜨렸을 수 있습니다. 서울의 다양한 지역뿐만 아니라 사람들이 이 사랑의 자물쇠를 울타리에 묶은 지역(시애틀의 다리와 유사), 다양한 레스토랑, 기념품 가게 등을 볼 수 있습니다. 박물관은 살아있다는 것을 깨닫지 못했습니다. (제주에 갔는데 별로 감흥이 없었습니다.) 우리는 타워에 있는 뷔페 레스토랑인 HanCook 레스토랑의 저녁 식사를 2인 기준 약 $88 USD에 구입하기로 결정했습니다. 이것에 대한 유일한 좋은 점은 가격에 타워 꼭대기까지의 여행이 포함되어 있다는 것입니다. 식당에 대한 리뷰가 따로 있지만, 그 식당을 끔찍하다고 쉽게 요약할 수 있습니다. 나는 저녁 식사 후 타워 주변을 걸을 수 있었습니다. 타워 자체에서 볼 수 있는 독특한 것은 많지 않습니다. 그 다음 우리는 타워 기슭에 있는 지역을 산책했습니다. 다시 말하지만 상점이나 레스토랑 측면에서 볼 수 있는 독특한 것은 많지 않습니다. 우리는 케이블카를 다시 탔습니다. 기다림이 훨씬 적었습니다. 아래로의 여행은 사건이 없었습니다. 하지만 8시 30분 조금 넘어서 다시 케이블카 정류장에 도착했는데 아쉽게도 명동행 막차는 8시 30분에 출발! 분명히, 케이블카 역 매표소에서는 이에 대해 경고하지 않습니다. 따라서 당신은 늑대에게 맡겨집니다. 이 경우에는 택시 운전사입니다. 나는 명동으로 돌아가고 싶지 않아 택시 기사에게 가서 명동으로 돌아갔습니다. 택시 기사는 즉시 20000원의 요금이 부과될 것이라고 말했습니다. 본질적으로 몇 마일 미만을 운전하는 데 $17 USD입니다(실제로 명동은 남산 케이블카 역에서 문자 그대로 불과 1-2마일 거리에 있습니다)! 그 때 택시를 타지 않고 UberBlack 차를 불렀어야 했는데... 하지만 교훈은 - 서울 택시 기사들을 조심하세요! 여하튼, N 서울 타워는 가볼 만한 다른 명소가 많기 때문에 서울 명소의 우선 순위 목록에서 낮아야 합니다."
270,270,270,3188,"The N Seoul Tower was an interesting site in that it seemed to offer different people different things. There was an element of fun mixed in to the back drop of the great views of the city plus the trees and nature that is the Namsan Park.  I didn't go up to the observation deck itself. I chose to stick to the viewing platforms around the tower which provided multi level views of different sides of the city.  One of the striking elements would be the love locks that are pretty much every where. A lot of couples come up here and the sheer number of locks is a testament to that. Whilst I came here during the day time you can imagine during sunset and the evening that this would be site for many couples seeking a romantic respite from the city below.  Around the tower itself, aside from the park, are restaurants and cafes that give you the opportunity to just relax and enjoy the environment. For families aside from letting the kids run around for a bit there are fun characters to take photos with.  Whilst I wouldn't necessarily say it's a must see I'd suggest choosing a time of day that meets the objectives of your visit whether it be as a group, family, couple or Individual and just enjoy chill out and enjoy yourself.  Note: I took the cable car up and a bus down. The walk from the metro station to the cable car station is very steep so take it slow walking up or consider getting a taxi if you're with people less mobile.",270,much,"N서울타워는 다양한 사람들에게 다른 것을 제공하는 것처럼 보인다는 점에서 흥미로운 사이트였습니다. 남산공원이라는 나무와 자연과 도시의 멋진 전망을 배경으로 재미의 요소가 뒤섞여 있었습니다. 전망대 자체에는 올라가지 않았습니다. 나는 도시의 다른 면을 다층적으로 볼 수 있는 타워 주변의 전망대를 선택했습니다. 눈에 띄는 요소 중 하나는 거의 모든 곳에서 사랑의 자물쇠가 될 것입니다. 많은 커플이 여기에 오고 수많은 자물쇠가 그 증거입니다. 낮에 이곳에 왔지만 일몰과 저녁에는 이곳이 아래 도시에서 낭만적인 휴식을 원하는 많은 커플을 위한 장소가 될 것이라고 상상할 수 있습니다. 타워 주변에는 공원을 제외하고 주변 환경을 즐기며 휴식을 취할 수 있는 레스토랑과 카페가 있습니다. 아이들이 잠시 뛰어 놀게하는 것 외에도 가족을 위해 사진을 찍을 재미있는 캐릭터가 있습니다. 꼭 보아야 할 곳이라고 말할 수는 없지만 그룹, 가족, 커플 또는 개인으로 방문 목적에 맞는 시간을 선택하고 휴식을 취하고 자신을 즐기십시오. 참고: 나는 케이블카를 타고 내려갔다. 지하철 역에서 케이블카 역까지의 도보는 매우 가파르므로 천천히 걸어 올라가거나 이동성이 적은 사람들과 함께라면 택시를 타는 것을 고려하십시오."
271,271,271,3190,To visit Seoul tower is a most because The view from The top is magnificent. If The weather is clear you can see allmost The hole city. And dont forget to buy a love lock before you go up(it's much cheaper down in the city). The lock is for couples in love and you can put The on allmost antingen upthere,271,much,서울타워를 방문하는 가장 큰 이유는 정상에서 바라보는 전경이 웅장하기 때문이다. 날씨가 맑으면 홀 시티를 거의 볼 수 있습니다. 그리고 올라가기 전에 사랑의 자물쇠를 사는 것을 잊지 마십시오(시내에서 훨씬 저렴합니다). 자물쇠는 사랑에 빠진 커플을 위한 것이고 당신은 거기에 거의 모든 것을 걸 수 있습니다
272,272,272,3195,"I was amazed at how much stuff is up on top of the mountain from which this tower arises. Restaurants galore, and not cheesy. Seems to be popular outing spot for locals, not just tourists.",272,much,나는 이 탑이 있는 산 꼭대기에 얼마나 많은 물건이 있는지 놀랐습니다. 레스토랑이 풍부하고 치즈가 없습니다. 관광객 뿐만 아니라 현지인들에게도 인기 있는 나들이 장소인 것 같습니다.
273,273,273,3202,"For a first time visit to Seoul, it would be good to consider the N Seoul Tower as one of your destinations. Of course, there are other similar places such as 63 Building for instance, but N Seoul Tower would be the easiest for a first time visitor.  To get up to N Seoul Tower, you would have to get to the Namsan Cable Car first. The cable car itself is about 15 minutes walk from Myeongdong Station. The cable car will get you up to the top of Namsan Park in about less than 5 minutes. However, be prepared for a wait of about 30 minutes at least during peak hours. Of course, there is the walking option from the bottom if you do not wish to wait that long.  If you wish to take a good shot at sunset or at night, I would say that it is actually better to take it from Namsan Park right outside the N Seoul Tower, rather than at N Seoul Tower itself. As we went during sunset time, it was quite crowded even outside N Seoul Tower itself, but the views are quite amazing even then. I would advise coming early to get a good view.  We went up to N Seoul Tower and found that the views are great, but there is not really too much difference from the views outside N Seoul Tower though. Because of the glass panels at the observation deck, it can be a little difficult to take photos without having reflection in it. It is better to go during the daytime if you wish to go up to the N Seoul Tower in my opinion.  There are a few restaurants serving those who are hungry for a reasonable price, along with a good view of the Seoul skyline as well. Overall, I would say N Seoul Tower would be good to visit once, but there are probably other better places to view the Seoul skyline, perhaps even for free too without the crowds.",273,much,"서울을 처음 방문한다면 N서울타워를 목적지 중 하나로 고려하는 것이 좋을 것입니다. 물론 예를 들어 63빌딩과 같은 다른 유사한 장소도 있지만 처음 방문하는 사람들에게는 N서울타워가 가장 쉬울 것입니다. N서울타워에 가려면 남산케이블카를 먼저 타야 한다. 케이블카 자체는 명동역에서 도보로 약 15분 거리에 있습니다. 케이블카를 타면 약 5분 이내에 남산공원 정상까지 올라갈 수 있습니다. 그러나 최소 피크 시간에는 약 30분 정도 기다려야 합니다. 물론 오래 기다리지 않으려면 바닥에서 걷는 옵션이 있습니다. 해질녘이나 밤에 사진을 잘 찍고 싶다면 N서울타워 자체보다는 N서울타워 바로 바깥 남산공원에서 찍는 것이 오히려 낫다고 말하고 싶다. 일몰 시간에 갔기 때문에 N서울타워 외부에도 사람이 꽤 많았는데, 그때도 뷰는 정말 끝내줬습니다. 좋은 전망을 보려면 일찍 오는 것이 좋습니다. N서울타워에 올라갔더니 전망이 정말 좋은데, N서울타워 밖과 별반 차이가 없다. 전망대의 유리 패널 때문에 반사가 없으면 사진을 찍기가 조금 어려울 수 있습니다. 내 생각에 N서울타워에 오르고 싶다면 낮에 가는 것이 좋다. 서울 스카이라인이 잘 보이는 곳에 합리적인 가격으로 배고픈 사람들을 위한 레스토랑이 몇 군데 있습니다. 전반적으로 N 서울 타워는 한 번 방문하는 것이 좋지만 서울 스카이라인을 보기에 더 좋은 다른 장소가 있을 것입니다. 아마도 군중 없이 무료로라도 마찬가지일 것입니다."
274,274,274,3217,"We are residents in Seoul since 4 years and we went every year more as twice up to the tower. It was a nice green place within a busy town. I remember 3 years ago it was a relaxing walk up and down and also the tower area was quite peaceful. Somehow I have the feeling it is worsening year by year. The operator has started to renovate and offer now several floors with shops, restaurants and whatsoever. Some of them opened and just closed again. LOL. Why? Because probably not many people will spend a penny there. There are mainly interested in making selfies. That's it. And who shall buy all these things you really don't need? We went there and left every time at least 50k for tower entrance and a beer, coffee or ice cream. There were a few shops totally enough to serve visitors. And usually you climb up to have a nice few and not to drink and eat whole day long. Anyway this time is over for us spending any coin there. This year every time we visited the place it was totally over crowded. If you want to visit tower's upper floor you shall wait at least an hour or even more. Especially on the weekends. Same way down. I can be wrong but since 2015 it changed dramatically. We usually walking either up or down along the small road. I remember the time when we saw many people using the bike to go up. Time is over. Now every minute some old diesel engine is rushing uphill to unload and to come back to collect again. Some of them are driving fast and reckless. If you have kids you are mainly busy with watching them because you are afraid that something happened. I really wonder why Seoul citizens are not doing much about it. Did they gave up already? Do they like how it is? This place becomes really disgusting. It has nothing to do anymore with a nice, beautiful, quiet, green, park and place. It just became a polluted place of commerce. We will not visit again. We are done with this tower. Have fun.",274,much,"우리는 4년 동안 서울에 거주하고 있으며 매년 두 번 이상 타워에 올랐습니다. 번화한 도시 안에 있는 멋진 녹지였습니다. 3년 전만 해도 위아래로 한가로운 산책이었고 타워 주변도 꽤 평화로웠던 걸로 기억합니다. 어쩐지 해가 갈수록 심해지는 느낌이 든다. 운영자는 개조를 시작했으며 현재 상점, 레스토랑 등이 있는 여러 층을 제공합니다. 그들 중 일부는 열렸다가 다시 닫혔습니다. ㅋㅋㅋ. 왜요? 아마 많은 사람들이 거기에 한 푼도 쓰지 않을 것이기 때문입니다. 주로 셀카를 만드는 데 관심이 있습니다. 그게 다야 그리고 당신이 정말로 필요로 하지 않는 이 모든 것을 누가 사겠습니까? 우리는 거기에 가서 타워 입구와 맥주, 커피 또는 아이스크림을 위해 매번 최소 50k를 떠났습니다. 손님을 응대하기에 충분한 상점이 몇 개있었습니다. 그리고 보통 당신은 술을 마시지 않고 하루 종일 먹지 않기 위해 올라갑니다. 어쨌든 이 시간은 우리가 거기에서 어떤 코인이라도 쓰는 것입니다. 올해 우리가 방문할 때마다 그곳은 완전히 붐볐습니다. 타워의 고층을 방문하려면 최소 1시간 이상을 기다려야 합니다. 특히 주말에. 같은 방법으로 아래로. 내가 틀릴 수 있지만 2015년 이후로 극적으로 바뀌었습니다. 우리는 보통 작은 길을 따라 오르거나 내려갑니다. 많은 사람들이 자전거를 타고 올라가는 것을 보았을 때를 기억합니다. 시간이 끝났습니다. 이제 매분 오래된 디젤 엔진이 내리막길을 오르막으로 돌진하고 있습니다. 그들 중 일부는 빠르고 무모하게 운전합니다. 자녀가 있는 경우에는 무슨 일이 일어날까 두려우므로 주로 자녀를 지켜보느라 바쁩니다. 왜 서울 시민들은 그것에 대해 별로 하지 않는지 정말 궁금합니다. 그들은 이미 포기 했습니까? 그들은 어떻게 그것을 좋아합니까? 이 곳은 정말 역겨워집니다. 그것은 더 이상 멋지고, 아름답고, 조용하고, 푸르고, 공원과 장소와 아무 관련이 없습니다. 오염된 상가가 되었습니다. 우리는 다시 방문하지 않을 것입니다. 우리는 이 타워를 끝냈습니다. 즐거운 시간 보내세요."

It is hard to believe the amount of people (10 million) who live in the city until you see the vast spread of high rise living. Next, go down a level, that I think is actually better than the top level. Go down to the bottom and spend time looking at all the love locks.....they are EVERYWHERE.

282,282,282,3340,"Well, we have visited many Sky Towers in different cities in our walk around the world and every time when we come across a new one, we would not hesitate to visit it because the view on the city will be different and will gain unique and wonderful experience.  So in our recent Seoul trip, we decided to visit the N Seoul Tower. It was about past 4.00pm when we arrived and the place was still crowded with visitors mostly foreigners. The viewing point on the ground floor was already awesome and it was built on top on the hill. Along the way, we saw trees with ""LOVE LOCKS"" besides the the mental railings that also have such locks too! It was so colourful and impressive! Unlike the love lock bridges in European cities, mostly located above a river where one would throw the keys into the river after locking it, right here, there is no river but one can throw the keys down the hill! Haha. (you can actually buy a lock in the souvenir shop)  Upon entering the tower via the main entrance, we immediately saw a souvenir and gift shop with a lovely Hello Kitty display at its entrance and no one could withstand the temptation for not taking a photo with it.  Our fullday city tour guide had gone to the ticketing booth to get us the ticket to the top while we were busy taking photos with the Hello Kitty!  Then we took the elevator to the top (according to our guide, the tower was about 250m tall, about 80 storeys if I didn't remember wrongly). While most elevators in other Towers are standard and quite ""boring"" while moving upwards, the ceiling of the elevator here has astonishing moving animations (that depicted moving into the space galaxy) and it was indeed impressive. So everyone in the elevator were kept occupied and so focused on it and forgot the ""time spent"" in getting up there. (anyway, it was quite fast too, think less than a minute)  When we arrived at the top, wow! The view here was spectacular! We walked around 360 degree and really have had a great bird eye's view on Seoul, could see the Gangnam area (South of the Han River), Myeongdong etc. As the sky was still bright, the view was cleared! We really enjoyed the view so much!  There is also a souvenir and gift store right well where you could grab some candies, t-shirts, postcards etc here. Though the place is touristy but they had some promotions and so the items we grabbed here were still reasonable in price.  After our visit here, we took the elevator down to the 1st storey where we had to walk through a ""tunnel"" with LED TVs on both sides featuring Seoul in different times and development phases via computer graphics and animations (on the other side, they also have TV screens that show the history of the country as one walks around). It was very interesting and fascinating and no doubt why Korea is so advance in IT and technology!  Well, if you like heights and good city view from the top of the world, this place will be relevant and good for you. As mentioned earlier, each sky tower is different and offer different and unique views on the city and so it's unfair to compare with one to another. Visit with an open mind and with the feeling to see and experience new and different things, your visit here will be fun, interesting and wonderful!",282,much,"글쎄요, 우리는 전 세계를 걸으면서 여러 도시에 있는 많은 스카이 타워를 방문했으며, 매번 새로운 스카이 타워를 발견할 때마다 주저하지 않고 방문합니다. 경험. 그래서 우리는 최근 서울 여행에서 N 서울 타워를 방문하기로 결정했습니다. 우리가 도착한 시간은 오후 4시가 조금 넘은 시간이었는데도 대부분 외국인 관광객들로 붐볐다. 1층의 전망대는 이미 굉장했고 언덕 꼭대기에 지어졌습니다. 길을 따라 우리는 ""LOVE LOCKS""가 있는 나무를 보았습니다. 정신 난간에도 이러한 잠금 장치가 있습니다! 너무 색다르고 인상적이었어요! 열쇠를 잠그고 강물에 던져 넣는 유럽 도시의 사랑의 자물쇠 다리와 달리 여기 강은 없지만 언덕 아래로 열쇠를 던질 수 있습니다! ㅋ. (실제로는 기념품 가게에서 자물쇠를 살 수 있습니다) 정문을 통해 타워에 들어서자마자 입구에 귀여운 헬로키티가 전시된 기념품과 선물 가게가 있었고 아무도 사진을 찍지 않으려는 유혹을 참을 수 없었습니다. 그것으로. 우리가 헬로키티와 사진을 찍느라 바빴던 동안 우리의 하루 종일 시티 투어 가이드가 매표소로 가서 정상에 오르는 티켓을 얻었습니다! 그런 다음 우리는 엘리베이터를 타고 정상으로 올라갔습니다(우리 가이드에 따르면 타워는 높이가 약 250m, 기억이 잘못되지 않으면 약 80층이었습니다). 다른 타워에 있는 대부분의 엘리베이터는 표준적이고 위로 이동하는 동안 상당히 ""지루""하지만, 여기의 엘리베이터 천장에는 놀라운 움직이는 애니메이션(우주 은하계로 이동하는 것을 묘사함)이 있으며 실제로 인상적이었습니다. 그래서 엘리베이터에 있는 모든 사람들은 계속 바빠서 그것에 집중했고 거기에 올라가는 데 ""소요한 시간""을 잊어버렸습니다. (어쨌든 속도도 꽤 빨라서 1분도 안걸려) 정상에 도착했을 때 우와! 여기의 보기는 훌륭했다! 우리는 360도를 돌아 다니며 서울의 멋진 조감도를 보았습니다. 강남 지역 (한강 남쪽), 명동 등을 볼 수있었습니다. 하늘이 여전히 밝았 기 때문에보기가 맑았습니다! 우리는 보기를 정말로 즐겼다! 사탕, 티셔츠, 엽서 등을 구입할 수 있는 기념품 및 선물 가게도 있습니다. 장소는 touristy지만 그들은 약간의 판촉을 가지고 있었고 그래서 우리가 여기에서 잡았던 품목은 가격면에서 아직도 합리적이었다. 이곳을 방문한 후 우리는 엘리베이터를 타고 1층으로 내려갔고, 양쪽에 LED TV가 있는 ""터널""을 지나 컴퓨터 그래픽과 애니메이션을 통해 다른 시대와 개발 단계의 서울을 보여야 했습니다. 또한 걸어 다닐 때 국가의 역사를 보여주는 TV 화면이 있습니다). 매우 흥미롭고 매혹적이었고 한국이 IT와 기술에서 왜 그렇게 발전했는지 의심의 여지가 없습니다! 글쎄, 당신이 세계 정상에서 높은 곳과 좋은 도시 전망을 좋아한다면, 이곳은 당신과 관련이 있고 좋을 것입니다. 앞서 언급했듯이 스카이 타워마다 도시의 모습이 다르고 독특한 전망을 제공하므로 서로 비교하는 것은 불공평합니다. 열린 마음으로 방문하고 새롭고 다른 것을보고 경험하는 느낌으로 여기를 방문하면 재미있고 흥미롭고 훌륭할 것입니다!"
283,283,283,3355,We prefer night visit as the tower looks amazing with its colourful lightings. There isn't much to see inside the tower except admiring the city of Seoul in 360 deg. Of course you can leave without noticing the Love locks everywhere.,283,much,타워가 화려한 조명으로 멋지게 보이기 때문에 야간 방문을 선호합니다. 타워 내부는 360도 서울 시내를 감상하는 것 외에는 볼 것이 별로 없습니다. 물론 당신은 사랑의 자물쇠를 눈치채지 못한 채 떠날 수 있습니다.
284,284,284,3357,"Going up any tower like this will provide the best views of the city. You can walk up but is a hard climb. Alternatively you can get the cable car up. The prices are moderate, but you can't miss this. There are tours which also take you up, this cost much more.",284,much,이와 같은 타워를 올라가면 도시의 최고의 전망을 제공할 것입니다. 걸을 수는 있지만 오르기 힘들다. 또는 케이블카를 탈 수 있습니다. 가격은 보통이지만 이것을 놓칠 수 없습니다. 당신을 데려가는 여행도 있습니다. 이것은 훨씬 더 비쌉니다.
285,285,285,3364,"Got a entrance package that cost W26,000 with 2 entrance tic, 2 beer and a popcorn. That was the worst pop corn i ever had! But the rest was good. Not a very fascinating tower with a lot of people fighting to take picture at the window, so not much peaceful place for you to get a peaceful high view from top. Which I believe is the same in most part of the towel in the world. If you do not want to buy a ticket, just walk around the towel at the place where the tourist hang the lock. Is another nice place also, but free. Oh, the towel has transparent toilet....",285,much,"입장권 2개, 맥주 2개, 팝콘이 포함된 26,000원의 입장권을 받았습니다. 그것은 내가 가진 최악의 팝콘이었습니다! 하지만 나머지는 좋았습니다. 많은 사람들이 창가에서 사진을 찍기 위해 싸우는 매우 매혹적인 타워가 아니므로 위에서 평화로운 높은 전망을 얻을 수있는 평화로운 곳이별로 없습니다. 내가 믿는 것은 세계의 대부분의 수건에서 동일합니다. 표를 사지 않으려면 관광객이 자물쇠를 걸어 놓은 곳에서 수건 주위를 걸어 다니십시오. 또 다른 좋은 장소이지만 무료입니다. 아 수건에 변기가 투명하다...."
286,286,286,3377,"Fascinating place to visit. So much more than just the view, which would be worth the visit on it's own. The walk through the park was very peaceful, but very steep in parts. If that is a concern the cable car is a less strenuous way of getting to the top.",286,much,방문하기에 매혹적인 장소. 그 자체로 방문할 가치가 있는 전망 그 이상입니다. 공원을 통한 산책은 매우 평화롭지만 부분적으로는 매우 가파르다. 그것이 우려되는 경우 케이블카는 정상에 도달하는 덜 힘든 방법입니다.
287,287,287,3393,"It is a nice view even from the decks without going up the tower. You can have a beautiful view of Seoul especially when the weather is bright and clear. When we were up there, there was also a performance and also the opportunity to wear Hanbok (traditional Korean attire) for those who are interested. Namsan is the place where people would put their lock of love and leave it there. If you forgot to buy one prior to your visit, there is a souvenir shop which sells those locks and gifts too.I would say you can buy cheaper locks before you get up but I guess the locks up there are fancier. My family and I decided to not go up the tower since it was foggy the day we visit. We figured it wouldn't be worth a visit as we couldn't see much, either. I would strongly recommended to go either at night or on a clear day so that you can get the most out of your visit. A foggy day isn't exactly they best but if that is the only choice you have, just staying at the deck would be enough.",287,much,타워를 오르지 않고 데크에서 바라보는 뷰도 좋다. 특히 날씨가 화창하고 맑은 날에는 서울의 아름다운 전경을 감상할 수 있습니다. 우리가 거기에있을 때 공연도 있었고 관심있는 사람들을 위해 한복을 입을 기회도있었습니다. 남산은 사람들이 사랑의 자물쇠를 넣고 그곳에 두는 곳입니다. 방문하기 전에 하나 사는 것을 잊었다면 그 자물쇠와 선물도 판매하는 기념품 가게가 있습니다. 일어나기 전에 더 저렴한 자물쇠를 살 수 있다고 말하고 싶지만 거기 자물쇠가 더 멋진 것 같아요. 우리 가족은 우리가 방문하는 날 안개가 껴서 타워에 가지 않기로 결정했습니다. 우리도 많이 볼 수 없었기 때문에 방문할 가치가 없다고 생각했습니다. 나는 당신이 당신의 방문을 최대한 활용할 수 있도록 밤이나 맑은 날에 갈 것을 강력히 추천합니다. 안개가 낀 날이 가장 좋은 것은 아니지만 그것이 유일한 선택이라면 갑판에 머무르는 것만으로도 충분할 것입니다.
288,288,288,3394,View is great! Do not expect much in the observatory. Two ways to get to the tower: 1. ride the cable car which is very expensive because you'll be standing with 49 other people 2. use stairs via Namsan Park,288,much,보기는 훌륭합니다! 전망대에서 많은 것을 기대하지 마십시오. 타워에 가는 두 가지 방법: 1. 49명과 함께 서야 하기 때문에 매우 비싼 케이블카를 타십시오. 2. 남산 공원을 통해 계단을 이용
289,289,289,3406,"We went up with the cable car, overall nice view but nothing more.

But I don't know how much it costs because I hiked the whole thing.",290,much,숨막히는 전망. 맑은 공기. 감히 끝까지 하이킹을 시도하십시오. 운동을 하고 식욕을 돋우기에 좋습니다. 주말과 한국 공휴일에는 인파가 몰릴 것으로 예상됩니다. 오르기 싫다면 케이블카를 타고 정상까지 데려다주고 내려갈 수 있습니다. 근데 다 걷다보니 비용이 얼마인지는 모르겠다.
291,291,291,3446,"We went up to see the view from the tower, but all we could see was the haze and pollution coming from China to Korea. Would have been much better at night to see the lights.",291,much,우리는 타워에서 전망을 보기 위해 올라갔지만 중국에서 한국으로 들어오는 안개와 오염 만 볼 수있었습니다. 밤에 불빛을 봤다면 훨씬 좋았을 텐데.
292,292,292,3449,Gives you a nice view of Seoul. It was our first time to ride a cable car so that was fun but a bit scary for me. There were too many visitors both locals and tourists. There was a small area for lovelocks just like in Paris. Nothing really much to do there except take photos. No need to go up the tower really.,292,much,서울의 멋진 전망을 제공합니다. 케이블카를 타는 것은 처음이라 재미있었지만 조금 무서웠습니다. 현지인과 관광객 모두 너무 많은 방문객이있었습니다. 파리처럼 러브락을 위한 작은 공간이 있었다. 사진을 찍는 것 외에는 정말로 할 일이 없습니다. 정말 타워에 올라갈 필요가 없습니다.

When we came, it was drizzling, and sky was cloudy and so we could not see much. in my view eventhoug it was a pefect sunny day, the view was ok, nothing special. But they were very creative with the padlocks that visitors put on the fence and places, that create interesting decorations.",295,much,서울 N타워는 서울 시내를 한 눈에 볼 수 있는 또 다른 타워다. 우리가 갔을 땐 이슬비가 내리고 하늘이 흐려 잘 보이지 않았다. 내 보기에 그것은 완벽한 화창한 날이었고 보기는 괜찮았고 특별한 것은 없었습니다. 그러나 그들은 방문객들이 울타리와 장소에 설치한 자물쇠로 흥미로운 장식을 만드는 데 매우 창의적이었습니다.
296,296,296,3526,"It was so nice to reach to the top of the tower, i recommend you go at night to see the view. It was much more exciting. I bought the ticket from TravoAsia, just search it online or mobile app. they offer better discount. They seems focus on Korea and JP only at the moment. Anyway, i believe its worth to check out. Good Luck",296,much,"타워 꼭대기에 도달하는 것이 너무 좋았습니다. 야경을 보려면 밤에 가는걸 추천합니다. 훨씬 더 흥미진진했습니다. 저는 TravoAsia에서 티켓을 구입했는데 온라인이나 모바일 앱에서 검색하면 됩니다. 그들은 더 나은 할인을 제공합니다. 그들은 현재 한국과 JP에만 집중하는 것 같습니다. 어쨌든, 나는 체크 아웃 할 가치가 있다고 생각합니다. 행운을 빕니다"

301,301,301,3625,"The N Tower is fun to visit - you can see the panorama of Seoul and even put a little lock with your name on the ""tree-lock"". The way up to the lift is long, windy and arduous - hence, use the inclining lift cabin on the main road - it's much more fun, unless you're into hiking!  There is a shop at the bottom of the cabin which offers all kind of merchandise - don't be tempted, as prices are atrocious and you can get things twice as cheap in the town.  Purchase a return ticket - don't be tempted to purchase a ticket with a meal- and off you go.  There is a lift that could take you up the 5 flights of stairs, but only if you're very old or very pregnant :) - we braved the lift anyway and were told that we have to be ""punished"" by waiting 10 min for such ""disobedience"". The visitors are lined up in a very ""military"" / ""communist regime"" style - you do what you told! - but this is all part of the experience!  Up the top, there are more steps to conquer - then, you're (almost) at the top. The views are great, and there are plenty of opportunities for the photographs and selfies.  There is a concert available on a daily basis , - worth watching for a bit, and there are plants of eateries up the top, although the prices are higher that in downtown Seoul.

312,312,312,3822,Very long climb and not much to do from the top except take photos and get a nice view of Seoul.  Because of the long climb you can easily spend 3 hours in the area which is better spent elsewhere.  The viewing area is enclosed so not very romantic. The locks area is cool for couples though!  Would just visit this once but there are better places to go.,312,much,매우 긴 등반과 사진을 찍고 서울의 멋진 전망을 얻는 것 외에는 정상에서 할 일이별로 없습니다. 긴 등반 때문에 다른 곳에서 보내는 것이 더 나은 지역에서 쉽게 3시간을 보낼 수 있습니다. 관람 구역이 폐쇄되어 그다지 낭만적이지 않습니다. 잠금 장치 영역은 커플에게 시원합니다! 한 번만 방문하면 더 좋은 곳이 있습니다.
313,313,313,3826,"I visited seoul tower in the month of July. It was my birthday so I got a good discount for visiting seoul tower. They also offer many foreigners and couples discount. Tower was just fine as there was nothing much to do. View from the top was good and that's all. Get some pictures clicked with a background view and you are done. You can also purchase souvenirs for yourself. We carried out our own lunch so dont have much idea about the food services there. After having our lunch, we visited the alive museum which was right next to the Seoul tower. I would highly recommend you to visit Alive museum if you want to have super fun and planning to visit Seoul tower. Otherwise, visiting seoul tower alone is a complete waste of time in my opinion. Good luck!!! :)",313,much,저는 7월에 서울타워를 방문했습니다. 제 생일이라 서울타워 구경할 때 좋은 할인을 받았어요. 그들은 또한 많은 외국인과 커플 할인을 제공합니다. 타워는 할 일이 별로 없어서 괜찮았습니다. 정상에서의 전망은 좋았고 그게 전부였습니다. 배경 보기로 몇 장의 사진을 클릭하면 완료됩니다. 자신을 위한 기념품을 구입할 수도 있습니다. 우리는 우리 자신의 점심을 먹었으므로 거기의 음식 서비스에 대해 잘 모릅니다. 점심을 먹고 서울타워 바로 옆에 있는 살아있는 박물관을 찾았다. 매우 재미 있고 서울 타워를 방문 할 계획이라면 살아있는 박물관을 방문하는 것이 좋습니다. 그렇지 않으면 혼자 서울 타워를 방문하는 것은 내 생각에 완전히 시간 낭비입니다. 행운을 빕니다!!! :)
314,314,314,3827,"We had the wrong time to visit N Seoul Tower (there was a scheduled fireworks display and so the place, being up high and a good viewing area, was jampacked with people) so we did not enjoy it much. It was even difficult to get on a bus from somewhere near Myeongdong to N Seoul Tower. If it were a different day, it would have been better :) That aside, I think NSeoulTower area is an entertaining place, with food places, Bear museum, good view of Seoul and a good place to walk around (be prepared if you want to walk uphill though).",314,much,"우리는 N 서울 타워를 방문하는 시간이 잘못되어 (예정된 불꽃 놀이가 있었기 때문에 장소가 높고 전망이 좋은 곳이 사람들로 가득 찼습니다) 많이 즐기지 못했습니다. 명동 근처에서 N서울타워까지 버스를 타는 것조차 힘들었다. 다른 날이었다면 더 좋았을 텐데 :) 그건 그렇고 NSeoulTower 주변은 먹거리, 곰박물관, 서울 전경, 산책하기 좋은 곳이 있는 재미있는 곳인 것 같아요. 오르막길을 걷는다)."
315,315,315,3841,I was stupid enough to want to walk there. DON'T. The road takes you round and round around the tower instead of straight to it. Just take the bus there it's much easier. You can take the bus to the Tower from meongdong. The tower itself was very expensive. Too expensive. So I didn't bother going up there even though it took me an hour and a half to walk there. The view from the bottom of the tower was already nice so I didn't want to pay 22000 won to go further up for apparently nothing.,315,much,"나는 거기까지 걷고 싶을 정도로 어리석었다. 하지 않다. 길은 당신을 타워로 곧장 가는 대신 빙글빙글 돕게 합니다. 거기에서 버스를 타면 훨씬 쉽습니다. 명동에서 타워까지 버스를 탈 수 있습니다. 타워 자체는 매우 비쌌습니다. 너무 비싼. 그래서 1시간 30분을 걸어가는데도 굳이 올라가지 않았습니다. 타워 아래에서 내려다보는 뷰가 이미 멋있어서 22,000원을 내고 더 올라가고 싶지는 않은 것 같다."
316,316,316,3844,"Well, nothing much to talk about this place..but the scenery was amazing esp at night. I went in Feb this year, decided not to take the cable car and climb up to the top with my own foot(worst decision ever..), i wish someone would carry me, unfortunately..not be able to find one. I don't spend too much time here, 1hr is enough because its too crowded..people everywhere, really hard to find a good spot for me to take a picture(sighed). But still worth a visit.",316,much,"글쎄,이 장소에 대해별로 이야기 할 것이 없습니다. 그러나 밤에는 경치가 훌륭했습니다. 나는 올해 2 월에 갔고 케이블카를 타지 않고 내 발로 정상에 오르기로 결정했습니다 (최악의 결정 ..). 누군가가 나를 데려 갔으면 좋겠다. 불행히도 .. 하나를 찾을 수 없습니다. 나는 여기에서 너무 많은 시간을 보내지 않습니다. 너무 혼잡하기 때문에 1 시간이면 충분합니다. .. 사람들이 도처에 있고 사진을 찍을 좋은 장소를 찾기가 정말 어렵습니다 (한숨). 그러나 여전히 방문할 가치가 있습니다."
317,317,317,3845,"I've been wanting to come here ever since I first saw that cable car scene from My Lovely Sam Soon and was not disappointed! We planned to arrive during sunset and the hotel I was staying is pretty nearby, so we decided to walk on over. The walk up to the cable car station wasn't bad at all, probably because there is this elevator/ramp hybrid thing that helps you up this last steep portion. The cable cars were really cool to ride in although they do kind of pack you in since there are a lot of people.  Once you get to the top you have to climb a few more flights of stairs, which isn't bad, but may be for those with mobility issues. Once you get close to the top you can start to see all the locks of love. There were quite a few vendors selling locks so those looking to lock their love last minute don't have to worry. The view below the tower is really gorgeous although it was a bit windy when we went. There are quite a few restaurants/shops around the bottom of the tower for those who are hungry from the climb.  The tower costs an additional extra to go up to and we bought the package deal in which popcorn/drinks are included. It's funny how they play this scene that you're blasting off to space as you ascend in the elevator. Once you get to the top of the tower, it's pretty much a 360 degree view of Seoul with souvenir shops in the middle. I like how on each window it tells you how far you are from a major city in the world and it's nice to sit down and chill next to a pretty view .  There's not a wholeee lot to do here besides admiring the scenery, but the entire experience was definitely worth it and fun!",317,much,"내 이름은 삼순이에서 케이블카 장면을 처음 본 이후로 여기오고 싶었고 실망하지 않았습니다! 우리는 일몰 시간에 도착할 예정이었고 내가 머물렀던 호텔이 꽤 가까워서 걸어서 가기로 결정했습니다. 케이블카 역까지의 도보는 전혀 나쁘지 않았습니다. 아마도 이 마지막 가파른 부분을 올라가는 데 도움이 되는 이 엘리베이터/램프 하이브리드가 있기 때문일 것입니다. 케이블카는 사람들이 많기 때문에 일종의 포장을하지만 타기에 정말 시원했습니다. 정상에 오르면 몇 층 더 계단을 올라야 하는데, 나쁘지는 않지만 거동이 불편한 사람들을 위한 것일 수 있습니다. 정상에 가까워지면 사랑의 자물쇠가 모두 보이기 시작할 수 있습니다. 자물쇠를 판매하는 상인이 꽤 많았으므로 마지막 순간에 사랑을 잠그려는 사람들은 걱정할 필요가 없습니다. 우리가 갔을 때 바람이 조금 불었지만 타워 아래의 전망은 정말 화려합니다. 등반에서 배고픈 사람들을 위해 타워 바닥 주위에 꽤 많은 레스토랑/상점이 있습니다. 타워는 올라가는 데 추가 비용이 들며 우리는 팝콘/음료가 포함된 패키지 거래를 샀습니다. 엘리베이터를 타고 올라갈 때 우주로 날아가는 이 장면을 그들이 어떻게 연기하는지 재미있습니다. 타워 꼭대기에 오르면 중간에 기념품 가게가 있는 서울의 거의 360도 전망을 볼 수 있습니다. 나는 각 창에서 당신이 세계의 주요 도시에서 얼마나 멀리 떨어져 있는지 알려주는 방식을 좋아하고 아름다운 전망 옆에 앉아서 차가워지는 것이 좋습니다. 경치를 감상하는 것 외에는 여기에서 할 일이 많지 않지만 전체 경험은 확실히 가치 있고 재미있었습니다!"
318,318,318,3847,"Twice I've been there during winter. I love walking up the slope and looking at the scenery and how the trees cast shadows on the path. I'm not sure how it'll feel for summer though. The wind can be a little too much for winter and high altitude. I think u have to go up the tower itself so that you won't get blown away. Same, I think scenery up the tower is best when you go just before sunset so that you can enjoy 2 different feel.",318,much,나는 겨울 동안 두 번 거기에 갔다. 나는 비탈길을 걷고 풍경과 나무들이 길에 그림자를 드리우는 것을 보는 것을 좋아합니다. 여름엔 어떨지 모르겠지만. 바람은 겨울과 높은 고도에 약간 너무 많을 수 있습니다. 나는 당신이 날아 가지 않도록 타워 자체로 올라가야한다고 생각합니다. 마찬가지로 타워에 오르는 풍경은 해가지기 직전에 갈 때가 가장 좋은 것 같아서 두 가지 다른 느낌을 즐길 수 있습니다.
319,319,319,3855,"Hit the cable car walk round the summit once then bail.  Amazing views, inexpensive with a sweet cable ride in & out.  Highlights: views Lowlights: not much education as to why it exists.",319,much,"케이블카를 타고 정상 주변을 한 번 돌았다가 탈출하세요. 놀라운 전망, 저렴한 케이블 인 & 아웃으로 저렴합니다. 하이라이트: 보기 낮은 것: 그것이 존재하는 이유에 대한 교육이 많지 않습니다."
320,320,320,3873,This attraction isn't the cheapest in Seoul but it's definitely good if you want great views of Seoul. The first time I went it was foggy and I couldn't really see much so they give me a ticket to go back. This was good for me because I was in Korea for a year but not so good if you are only there for a short period of time. So it's definitely worth checking the weather before going. I've been both day and night time. During the day it's a nice walk through Namsan Park up to the tower and there was different games and activities going on outside of the tower. On the night time the tower is lit up and the views from the top were amazing! So it really just depends what you want to see. I've walked up and took the cable car. The walk was nice but can take a while so again it depends if you like the walk or just want to see the tower. The restaurant in the tower is nice and you can get a combo ticket for a meal and entry but it is also very expensive. There's a gift shop in the tower also.,320,much,이 명소는 서울에서 가장 저렴하지는 않지만 서울의 멋진 전망을 원한다면 확실히 좋습니다. 처음 갔을 땐 안개가 자욱해서 잘 보이지 않아서 다시 갈 수 있는 티켓을 주셨어요. 1년 동안 한국에 있었기 때문에 이것은 나에게 좋았지만 짧은 기간 동안만 거기에 있다면 그다지 좋지 않았습니다. 따라서 가기 전에 날씨를 확인하는 것이 좋습니다. 저는 낮과 밤을 모두 보냈습니다. 낮에는 남산 공원을 지나 타워까지 걸어가는 것이 좋으며 타워 밖에서 다양한 게임과 활동이 진행되고 있습니다. 밤 시간에는 타워에 조명이 켜지고 정상에서 보는 전망은 훌륭했습니다! 그래서 그것은 당신이보고 싶은 것에 달려 있습니다. 걸어서 올라가서 케이블카를 탔습니다. 산책은 좋았지 만 시간이 걸릴 수 있으므로 산책을 좋아하는지 아니면 타워를보고 싶은지에 따라 다릅니다. 타워의 레스토랑은 훌륭하고 식사와 입장을 위한 콤보 티켓을 얻을 수 있지만 또한 매우 비쌉니다. 타워에는 선물 가게도 있습니다.
321,321,321,3875,"Seoul tower was amazing! The views were great and there was so much to do inside the tower like take fun pictures, eat and of course shop! The hike to the tower was fun although tiring for those not in the best shape, but worth it!",321,much,"서울 타워는 훌륭했습니다! 보기는 훌륭했고 재미있는 사진을 찍고, 먹고, 물론 쇼핑하는 것과 같이 타워 내부에서 할 일이 너무 많았습니다! 탑까지의 하이킹은 비록 최상의 상태는 아니지만 그만한 가치가 있는 사람들에게는 피곤하지만 재미있었습니다!"
322,322,322,3879,We didn't feel much great here. Its like normal mountain where you can find city view. Its not unique things for sure. I think its suitable for couples.,322,much,우리는 여기에서 크게 느끼지 못했습니다. 도시 전망을 볼 수있는 일반 산과 같습니다. 확실히 독특한 것은 아닙니다. 커플들에게 딱인 것 같아요.
323,323,323,3885,"The views were good and the facilities - restrooms, eating/dining were good and there's a plaza that is currently being constructed. I enjoyed the view from the top - however it wasn't that much better than the view from the hill, so I'm not sure it justified the price tag!",323,much,"전망도 좋았고 시설 - 화장실, 식사 / 식사도 좋았고 현재 건설중인 광장이 있습니다. 나는 정상에서의 전망을 즐겼습니다 - 그러나 그것은 언덕에서 보는 것보다 훨씬 좋지 않았기 때문에 가격표를 정당화했는지 확실하지 않습니다!"
324,324,324,3892,I once visited this place with my father and siblings. Being here was so pleasant and fun. Me and my siblings had so much fun. This place reminds me of the time I had with my family.,324,much,나는 한때 아버지와 형제 자매와 함께 이곳을 방문했습니다. 여기에 있는 것이 너무 즐겁고 재미있었습니다. 나와 내 형제들은 너무 재미있었다. 이 곳은 내가 가족과 함께 했던 시간을 생각나게 합니다.
325,325,325,3908,"We decided to take the cable car up and walk down. This was indeed the correct decision. If you decide to walk up be prepared for a tough climb. There was a 30 minute queue for the cable car and we were jammed into the car like sardines, but still it got us up to the tower OK and without breaking a sweat.  At the tower we were a bit confused about which ticket to buy. There was the observation tower and a combined Tower and Pavilion ticket, but it was not clear what the Pavilion actually was. Finally we bought a beer package which was access to the observation tower for 2 persons and a beer each for 26,000 in total. Not bad considering the tower alone would have been 20,000. cheapest beer we had in Seoul ha ha. You need to collect your beer though before you take the elevator to the top.  The views are pretty average. Its not like the Eiffel tower where you are looking down on so many historic places. Here you pretty much just see a concrete jungle.  When we came down we bought a lock and wrote our message on it and hung it on the fence. Kind of quirky but we enjoyed it. Finally we walked down to the bottom which is very enjoyable and recommended.",325,much,"우리는 케이블카를 타고 내려오기로 했다. 이것은 참으로 올바른 결정이었습니다. 당신이 걷기로 결정했다면 힘든 등반을 준비하십시오. 케이블카는 30분 정도 줄을 서서 정어리처럼 차에 갇혔지만 그래도 땀을 흘리지 않고 타워까지 OK였습니다. 타워에서 우리는 어떤 표를 사야 할지 약간 혼란스러웠습니다. 전망대와 타워와 파빌리온을 합친 입장권이 있었지만, 실제로 파빌리온이 무엇인지는 알 수 없었다. 마지막으로 우리는 2인용 전망대 입장권과 맥주 각각 26,000원인 맥주 패키지를 샀습니다. 타워만 20,000이었을 거라고 생각하면 나쁘지 않습니다. 서울에서 가장 싼 맥주 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 엘리베이터를 타고 꼭대기로 올라가기 전에 맥주를 모아야 합니다. 보기는 꽤 평균입니다. 그것은 당신이 많은 역사적인 장소를 내려다보고있는 에펠 탑과 다릅니다. 여기에서는 콘크리트 정글을 거의 볼 수 있습니다. 우리가 내려왔을 때 우리는 자물쇠를 사서 그 위에 우리의 메시지를 적고 그것을 울타리에 걸었습니다. 기발하지만 우리는 즐겼습니다. 마침내 우리는 매우 즐겁고 권장되는 바닥으로 걸어갔습니다."
326,326,326,3939,"It is easy to get to N Seoul Tower (travelled by train, forgot the station name, Tourist Information is very helpful if you ask them). It is a beautiful place, very scenic, I think everyone who visits Seoul should go to. Remember to have your camera. I recommend this for anyone however, for those with leg problem, they can only stay around Seoul Tower as the staircase is very very long to get to the top to look at the love lock. We had a great time there and took lots of pictures. My family and I enjoyed it very much (despite the bitter winter).",326,much,N서울타워에 쉽게 갈 수 있습니다. 서울을 방문하는 사람이라면 누구나 한번쯤은 가봐야 할 곳이라고 생각합니다. 카메라를 가지고 있어야 합니다. 나는 이것을 누구에게나 추천하지만 다리에 문제가있는 사람들은 사랑의 자물쇠를보기 위해 꼭대기까지 올라가는 계단이 매우 길기 때문에 서울 타워 주변에만 머물 수 있습니다. 우리는 그곳에서 즐거운 시간을 보냈고 많은 사진을 찍었습니다. 우리 가족과 나는 그것을 매우 즐겼습니다(혹독한 겨울에도 불구하고).
327,327,327,3955,Visited twice. 1st time went up with bus & 2nd time went up with cable car. The view is beautiful. Love this place so much.,327,much,"두 번 방문했습니다. 첫 번째는 버스로, 두 번째는 케이블카로 올라갔습니다. 보기가 아름답습니다. 이 장소를 너무 좋아합니다."
328,328,328,3966,"The views of the city are beautiful & there is some space for kids to roam around. We have visited in the daytime& it was foggy but we could still see well, and we have also visited at night, which offers its own beautiful view of Seoul. The gift shop has fun little souvenirs. Get directions on taking the bus here. It is much easier, especially when visiting with children. The tram is fun, but too much waiting & walking, so we prefer the bus .",328,much,도시의 전망이 아름답고 아이들이 돌아 다닐 수있는 공간이 있습니다. 우리는 낮에 방문했고 안개가 꼈지만 여전히 잘 볼 수 있었고 서울의 아름다운 전망을 제공하는 밤에도 방문했습니다. 선물 가게에는 재미있는 작은 기념품이 있습니다. 여기에서 버스를 타는 방법을 알아보세요. 특히 아이들과 함께 방문할 때 훨씬 쉽습니다. 트램은 재미있지만 기다림과 걷기가 너무 많아 버스를 선호합니다.
329,329,329,3970,"I've been to Seoul multiple times, but never made it up to the tower until this last visit. It was pretty much what I expected (def. not lacking on cheesy-tourist stands/tchotchkes), but I'm giving it 4 stars still because of the absolutely gorgeous views of Seoul. They even have little map lines on the windows so you can see what neighborhoods you're looking at... Plus you ""blast off"" to space in the elevator which is pretty hilarious and awesome.  Just for the views alone, I'd recommend everyone going at least once!",329,much,"나는 서울에 여러 번 갔지만 마지막 방문 때까지 타워에 올라가 본 적이 없습니다. 그것은 내가 예상했던 것과 거의 비슷했지만(치즈 관광 가판대/tchotchkes에 부족하지 않음), 서울의 절대적으로 멋진 전망 때문에 여전히 별 4개를 주고 있습니다. 심지어 창문에 작은 지도 선이 있어서 지금 보고 있는 동네를 볼 수 있습니다. 게다가 엘리베이터를 타고 우주로 ""출발""하는 것도 꽤 재미있고 굉장합니다. 보기만 해도 모두에게 한 번쯤은 가보시길 추천합니다!"
330,330,330,3977,We took the Cable Car up to the mountain then the elevator up to the observation deck. You are asked to look up in the elevator and watch a corny spectacle on a TV above you and are told that it takes 30 seconds to the top. Nice view. Best to go on a clear day when there is not much fog. Very people with a lot of people.,330,much,우리는 케이블카를 타고 산으로 올라간 다음 엘리베이터를 타고 전망대로 올라갔습니다. 엘리베이터에서 위를 올려다보고 위의 TV에서 진부한 광경을 시청하라는 요청을 받았으며 정상까지 30초가 걸린다고 합니다. 좋은 전망. 안개가 많지 않은 맑은 날에 가는 것이 가장 좋습니다. 많은 사람들과 함께 매우 사람들.
331,331,331,3981,We came here during cherry blossom - we took cable car and the view was lovely. Nothing much to see in N seoul tower though but it still attract both local and international tourist (like us). It famous with amongst korean drama fans (like me) so yes we take a visit there.,331,much,우리는 벚꽃이 만발하는 동안 여기에 왔습니다. 우리는 케이블카를 탔고 경치는 멋졌습니다. N 서울 타워에서 볼 것이 많지는 않지만 여전히 현지 및 국제 관광객 (우리와 같은)을 끌어들입니다. 한국 드라마 팬(저 같은) 사이에서 유명해서 우리는 그곳을 방문합니다.
332,332,332,3990,"We visited N Seoul Tower at the end of a gray day, so the views were compromised; however, we had a blast! The best fun was the ride up in the cable car. It started snowing and this was quite beautiful. As it was a bit dark out, the views weren't much and the tower itself pales a bit compared to Taipei 101 or the Tokyo Tower, but it is still fun, just a bit touristy. The coup was in walking down through the park. This was a joy and perhaps the most fun of the trip. The tower I could take or leave but the fun of wandering down from it was relaxing and fun.",332,much,"우리는 흐린 날 끝에 N 서울 타워를 방문하여 전망이 손상되었습니다. 그러나 우리는 폭발을 일으켰습니다! 최고의 재미는 케이블카를 타는 것입니다. 눈이 내리기 시작했고 이것은 꽤 아름다웠다. 밖이 조금 어두워서 전망이 좋지 않았고 타워 자체가 타이페이 101이나 도쿄 타워에 비해 약간 창백했지만 여전히 재미 있고 약간 관광객입니다. 쿠데타는 공원을 걷고 있었다. 이것은 여행의 기쁨이자 아마도 가장 재미있었을 것입니다. 탑은 내가 탈 수도 있고 탈 수도 있지만, 그 위에서 아래로 헤매는 재미는 편안하고 재미있었다."
333,333,333,3995,"We truly enjoy hiking to the top of Namsan to the tower. It is a good climb and we finish it off with a churro and ice cream or a burger. As you are climbing, cut off the main trail and onto the smaller trails through the trees. It is steeper, but much faster and more fun.",333,much,우리는 남산 정상에서 타워까지 하이킹을 정말 즐깁니다. 그것은 좋은 등반이며 우리는 츄로와 아이스크림 또는 버거로 마무리합니다. 등반할 때 주요 오솔길을 차단하고 나무 사이로 작은 오솔길로 들어갑니다. 더 가파르지만 훨씬 빠르고 재미있습니다.
334,334,334,4043,"My family and I decided to take the hike up to the N Seoul Tower rather than the cable cars since it had about a 2 hour wait. The hike can get steep and considering how out of shape I am, it was exhausting! You get great views with this hike, and many photo opportunities which I really enjoyed. Once we reached the top, I was just happy that I no longer had to walk! Hah. We purchased our tickets, ant it was about a 1 hour 15 minute walk. We ate at one of the restaurants that offered burgers and beers. All very delicious! We bought the ticket package that offered a free soda and popcorn. And man, that was a lot of popcorn! Completely not necessary. Once we got to the top, it was extremely crowded. The glass were extremely dirty so it was hard to get a good look out. The wait for the elevator ride back down took about 40 minutes. I am much more of a fan of the 63 City Tower.",334,much,"우리 가족은 약 2시간 정도 기다려야 해서 케이블카보다 N서울타워까지 하이킹을 하기로 했다. 하이킹은 가파르게 될 수 있고, 내가 얼마나 몸이 좋지 않은지를 고려하면, 그것은 지쳤습니다! 이 하이킹으로 멋진 전망과 내가 정말 즐겼던 많은 사진 기회를 얻을 수 있습니다. 정상에 오르자 더 이상 걸을 필요가 없어 기뻤습니다! 하. 우리는 우리 표를 샀다, 개미는 도보로 약 1시간 15분이었다. 우리는 햄버거와 맥주를 제공하는 레스토랑 중 한 곳에서 식사를 했습니다. 모두 매우 맛있습니다! 우리는 무료 탄산음료와 팝콘을 제공하는 티켓 패키지를 샀습니다. 그리고 팝콘이 정말 많았어요! 전혀 필요하지 않습니다. 정상에 오르니 엄청나게 붐볐다. 유리가 너무 더러워서 제대로 보기 힘들었습니다. 엘리베이터를 타고 다시 내려오는 데 40분 정도 소요되었습니다. 저는 63 City Tower의 팬입니다."
335,335,335,4080,Went to the N Seoul tower area at night time. It was not too crowded so made for a nicer viewing experience. It's not overly cheap for a ride to the top but it's a rather nice view. It's worth a visit if you want a nice view of the city. Can take as much or as little time as you like.,335,much,밤 시간에 N 서울 타워 지역에 갔다. 너무 붐비지 않아 더 좋은 관람 경험을 위해 만들었습니다. 정상까지 타는 비용이 너무 싼 것은 아니지만 전망은 꽤 좋습니다. 도시의 멋진 전망을 원한다면 방문할 가치가 있습니다. 원하는 만큼 시간이 소요될 수 있습니다.
336,336,336,4088,We walked uphill to reach the tower. It was good exercise and a much needed one too! The view from the top was breathtaking!,336,much,우리는 타워에 도달하기 위해 오르막길을 걸었습니다. 좋은 운동이었고 많이 필요한 운동이었습니다! 정상에서의 전망은 아슬 아슬했습니다!
337,337,337,4100,"The view of N Seoul Tower was so perfect for couples in love, with all the paddlocks they left behind to show how much they loved each other. The time I were there a feeling of loneliness suddenly set in. Becasuse I lost my husband 16 years ago. But after seeing lots of couples enjoyed taking pictures at that romantic place, I was relieved of the loneliness and feel very happy for them.",337,much,N 서울 타워의 전망은 사랑에 빠진 커플에게 너무 완벽했습니다. 그들이 서로를 얼마나 사랑하는지 보여주기 위해 모든 자물쇠가 남겨져있었습니다. 그곳에 있을 때 갑자기 외로움이 밀려왔습니다. 16년 전에 남편을 잃었기 때문입니다. 하지만 그 낭만적인 곳에서 많은 커플들이 사진을 찍고 즐거워하는 모습을 보니 외로움도 많이 풀렸고 그 모습이 너무 행복했습니다.
338,338,338,4101,"Came here in mid November and still had a great look of Autumn leaves. If going to the tower is your thing, it is 9000 won per person without any deals. I breezed through it as there is only so long you can look at city views. On the other hand, the base of the tower gives good enough views at all 360 degrees and there's restaurants and cafes to spend time there too. I highly recommend at least taking the 30 minutes walk down after you're done. You save some money and is a very pleasant walk. Lastly, choose a clear and sunny day, otherwise there's nothing much to see.",338,much,"11월 중순에 이곳에 왔는데 아직 가을 단풍이 멋졌습니다. 타워에 가는 것이 당신의 일이라면 1인당 9,000원입니다. 당신이 도시 전망을 볼 수 있는 시간이 거기에 있기 때문에 나는 그것을 통해 바람을 피웠다. 한편 타워 기단은 360도 어느 곳에서나 충분히 조망할 수 있으며, 그곳에서 시간을 보낼 수 있는 레스토랑과 카페도 있습니다. 나는 당신이 끝난 후 적어도 30 분을 걷는 것을 강력히 추천합니다. 당신은 약간의 돈을 절약하고 매우 즐거운 산책입니다. 마지막으로, 맑고 화창한 날을 선택하십시오. 그렇지 않으면 볼 것이 별로 없습니다."
339,339,339,4110,The line up to the Observatory will take about 40minutes. Once at the the tower I was in awe seeing all the city lights. The view is awesome. But there isn't much activity so after a few photos taken we went back down. It takes more time to line up than staying on top of the tower for the view of Seoul City,339,much,전망대까지의 줄은 약 40분 정도 소요됩니다. 일단 타워에서 나는 모든 도시의 불빛을 보고 경외감에 빠졌습니다. 보기는 굉장합니다. 그러나 활동이 많지 않아 몇 장의 사진을 찍은 후 다시 내려갔습니다. 타워 꼭대기에 서서 서울 시내를 바라보는 것보다 줄을 서는 시간이 더 오래 걸린다.
340,340,340,4119,"We took the Seoul city tour bus up to the tower. You still have to go up an incline to get to the base of the tower. The place is quite crowded with many tourists. And it is a bit of wait to go up. It's extremely expensive. It is not much different from visiting the Empire State Building or the CN tower. When we were there, one of the women's toilet exploded. Quite gross, but not much you can do when someone overstuffed the thing.",340,much,우리는 타워까지 서울 시티 투어 버스를 탔다. 탑 기슭에 가려면 여전히 경사를 올라야 합니다. 많은 관광객들로 붐비는 곳입니다. 그리고 올라오려면 조금 기다려야 합니다. 그것은 매우 비싸다. 엠파이어 스테이트 빌딩이나 CN 타워를 방문하는 것과 크게 다르지 않습니다. 우리가 거기에 있었을 때 여자 ​​화장실 중 하나가 폭발했습니다. 꽤 끔찍하지만 누군가가 물건을 과도하게 채울 때 할 수 있는 일은 많지 않습니다.
341,341,341,4124,Went here yesterday and finally after 3 hours managed to get to the top of the n tower. Be prepared to wait. And be prepared to wait a long time!! We waited over an hour just to get on the cable car and then had to wait again to go up the tower. The cable car takes you up the steep hill to the base of the tower and then you need to take the elevator to the top. It is possible to walk to the base of the tower but it is quite a long steep walk. That may be preferable to waiting the 70 mins we waited for the cable car though  Views from the top are magnificent though. Make sure your going on a clear day as you'd be pretty annoyed to wait so long to get up to not see much,341,much,어제 여기에 갔고 마침내 3 시간 후에 n 타워의 꼭대기에 도착했습니다. 기다릴 준비를 하십시오. 그리고 오래 기다릴 각오!! 우리는 케이블카를 타기 위해 한 시간 이상을 기다렸다가 타워를 오르기 위해 다시 기다려야했습니다. 케이블카를 타고 가파른 언덕을 올라 타워 바닥까지 올라간 다음 엘리베이터를 타고 꼭대기까지 올라야 합니다. 타워 기슭까지 걸어갈 수는 있지만 꽤 길고 가파른 길입니다. 정상에서의 전망은 훌륭하지만 케이블카를 기다리는 70 분을 기다리는 것보다 낫습니다. 많이 보지 않기 위해 너무 오래 기다리면 짜증이 날 수 있으므로 맑은 날에 가십시오.
342,342,342,4146,"The N Seoul Tower was a serious touristy spot. The night we went was incredibly crowded - they had several busses of kids there touring the tower so our wait to even get up to the elevators was and hour or so long. Once we got to the top, the view was gorgeous. Seoul was a huge city! Our way down took almost just as long as it did to go up. There was a line that snaked around to wait for the two elevators to take us back to the cable car. You pay a few extra dollars, but it's worth it to take the cable car down to the ground floor. Overall, I'm not too much into crowded places so probably won't be back again. However, I am a believer of always trying things as least once!",342,much,N 서울 타워는 심각한 관광지였습니다. 우리가 갔던 밤은 엄청나게 붐볐습니다. 거기에는 타워를 여행하는 어린이 버스가 여러 대 있어서 엘리베이터까지 기다리는 시간도 한 시간 정도였습니다. 정상에 올라서니 뷰가 정말 멋졌습니다. 서울은 거대한 도시였다! 내려가는 길은 올라가는 데 거의 시간이 걸렸습니다. 2대의 엘리베이터가 우리를 케이블카로 데려다 줄 때까지 줄을 서 있었습니다. 몇 달러를 추가로 지불해야 하지만 케이블카를 타고 1층으로 내려가는 것은 그만한 가치가 있습니다. 전반적으로 나는 붐비는 장소를 너무 좋아하지 않으므로 아마도 다시 돌아 오지 않을 것입니다. 그러나 나는 항상 한 번은 시도하는 것을 믿습니다!
343,343,343,4148,"I enjoyed all the different view with the different cities (how far away each city is). The gift shop has so much to offer. I mailed postcards from the Tower. It is expensive to eat at the Tower. The day we went to Tower was raining and overcast, which made it appear very smog. Would go again anytime!",343,much,나는 다른 도시와 함께 모든 다른 보기를 즐겼습니다(각 도시가 얼마나 멀리 떨어져 있는지). 선물 가게에는 많은 것이 있습니다. 나는 타워에서 엽서를 보냈다. 타워에서 먹는 것은 비싸다. 우리가 타워에 갔던 날은 비가 오고 흐려서 스모그가 많이 보였다. 언제든지 다시 갈 것입니다!
344,344,344,4165,"If you've seen pictures of Seoul, chances are you've seen one with the N Seoul Tower. Korea doesn't have much in the way of architectural landmarks - at least, not as many as some other tourist hotspots - but this tower has always provided a focal point in the Seoul city skyline.  The surrounding area under the tower has a handful of souvenir stores, restaurants, and cafes while the tower itself provides some good eats married with good views of the city.  A meal at the N Seoul Tower at night proves to be a great activity... just remember to cross your fingers and hope that no fog nor smog ruin the views during your visit.",344,much,"서울 사진을 본 적이 있다면 N서울타워가 있는 사진을 본 적이 있을 것입니다. 한국에는 건축물의 랜드마크가 별로 없습니다. 적어도 다른 관광 명소만큼 많지는 않습니다. 하지만 이 타워는 항상 서울 도시 스카이라인의 초점을 제공했습니다. 타워 아래의 주변 지역에는 기념품 가게, 레스토랑, 카페가 몇 군데 있으며 타워 자체에는 도시의 멋진 전망과 함께 맛있는 음식을 제공합니다. 밤에 N 서울 타워에서 식사하는 것은 훌륭한 활동임이 입증되었습니다... 방문하는 동안 안개나 스모그가 전망을 망치지 않기를 바랍니다."
345,345,345,4170,"I went in the late morning, sun was behind the tower, could not take photo.  Nothing much to see except if you are keen in the couple lock.  Night view is much nicer",345,much,나는 늦은 아침에 갔고 태양은 타워 뒤에 있었고 사진을 찍을 수 없었습니다. 커플 잠금 장치에 열중하는 경우를 제외하고는 볼 것이 별로 없습니다. 야경이 훨씬 멋집니다
346,346,346,4171,"Not sure if it was just the day we got there but once up to the top, We couldn't see much as it was very smoggy. The ride to the top was one a minute. Small elevator but the line up was very short. It's interesting looking at the million of love locks.",346,much,우리가 거기에 도착한 날인지 확실하지 않지만 한 번 정상에 올라서면 스모그가 많이 껴서 많이 볼 수 없었습니다. 정상까지의 소요 시간은 1분이었습니다. 작은 엘리베이터지만 줄은 매우 짧습니다. 수백만 개의 사랑의 자물쇠를 보는 것은 흥미 롭습니다.
347,347,347,4192,"Long queue up to Namsan Tower. Was advised that the best view is during sunset but missed it due to the long queue to the foothill of the tower.  Locals and tourists flock to this tourist spot for the love-locks which have become a lovers' haunt. Other than that, nothing much to do there.",347,much,남산타워까지 길게 늘어선 줄. 가장 좋은 전망은 일몰 동안이라는 조언을 받았지만 타워의 산기슭까지 긴 대기열로 인해 놓쳤습니다. 연인들의 소굴이 된 사랑의 자물쇠를 찾기 위해 현지인과 관광객들이 이 관광지로 모여듭니다. 그 외에는 별로 할 것이 없습니다.
348,348,348,4194,"Its a good experience though. I recommend hiking rather than riding the cable car on the way to the top. Its good theres show during 4pm onwards outside the vicinity. The observatory is so so. You can see the buildings, and thats it hehe.. Nothing much special but its worth an experience though.",348,much,그래도 좋은 경험입니다. 정상까지 가는 길은 케이블카보다는 등산을 추천합니다. 그 좋은 테레즈는 오후 4시에 인근 외부에서 계속됩니다. 전망대는 그렇네요. 당신은 건물을 볼 수 있습니다. 그리고 그것은 hehe..별로 특별한 것은 없지만 경험할만한 가치가 있습니다.
349,349,349,4195,"We bought tickets to go to the observatory, glad we used a discount coupon. It's like we bought entrance tickets to a souvenir shop to be honest. A short elevator ride and an even shorter walk around the observatory. Nothing much to see or do there.  The vicinity is nice, interesting to see all the locks and the night view of Seoul but no need to go up the observatory. I find that it's a waste of time and money (even if it was relatively cheap using coupons).",349,much,우리는 전망대에 가기 위해 티켓을 샀고 할인 쿠폰을 사용해서 기뻤습니다. 솔직히 기념품 가게 입장권을 샀던 것 같다. 엘리베이터를 타고 조금만 더 가면 전망대 주변을 둘러볼 수 있습니다. 볼 것도 할 것도 별로 없습니다. 주변은 멋지고 모든 자물쇠와 서울의 야경을 볼 수 있지만 전망대에 올라갈 필요는 없습니다. (비교적 쿠폰을 사용하여 저렴하더라도) 시간과 돈의 낭비라는 것을 알게 되었습니다.
350,350,350,4203,"We took the Namsan cable car to get here, that was quite an experience on its own. Had lunch straight away upon arrival at Best Burger in Seoul (yum!). Great facilities and friendly staff at N Seoul Tower made us feel comfortable. We took the lift up to observation deck, had our souvenir photo taken, and very much enjoyed the birds eye view from the top.",350,much,"우리는 남산 케이블카를 타고 여기까지 왔는데, 그 자체로 상당한 경험이었습니다. 서울 베스트 버거에 도착하자마자 점심을 먹었습니다 (yum!). N 서울 타워의 훌륭한 시설과 친절한 직원은 우리를 편안하게 만들었습니다. 전망대까지 리프트를 타고 올라가 기념사진도 찍고 정상에서 조감도를 즐겼습니다."
351,351,351,4216,"That is, if you've already visited other towers in the world much taller, newer viewing towers in other parts of the world. The copy cat Love Locks are a nice touch. And it does give a 360 degree view of Seoul skyline. There's a souvenir shop (not too pricy). And that's all there is to it. Go for it for a 'routine' part of the package tour.",351,much,"즉, 이미 세계의 다른 타워를 방문한 적이 있는 경우 훨씬 더 높고 세계의 다른 지역에 있는 최신 전망대입니다. 복사 고양이 Love Locks는 좋은 터치입니다. 그리고 서울의 스카이라인을 360도로 보여줍니다. 기념품 가게가 있습니다(너무 비싸지 않음). 그리고 그게 전부입니다. 패키지 여행의 '일상적인' 부분으로 이동하십시오."
352,352,352,4222,"I have been here twice and the second time I went up to the viewing deck. It was cool to see Seoul from that height. We took the local bus to get there, which is so much cheaper than the cable car, but we did get stuck in traffic which was annoying. I imagine that the view from the top at night would be spectacular, we went in the afternoon and spent some time figuring out what we could see from the top.",352,much,"나는 여기에 두 번 있었고 두 번째로 전망대에 올라갔습니다. 그 높이에서 서울을 바라보는 것이 멋졌다. 우리는 케이블카보다 훨씬 저렴한 시내 버스를 타고 거기에 도착했지만 우리는 성가신 교통 체증에 걸렸습니다. 나는 밤에 정상에서 보는 경치가 장관일 것이라고 상상하고, 우리는 오후에 가서 우리가 정상에서 무엇을 볼 수 있는지 알아내는 데 시간을 보냈습니다."
353,353,353,4225,"It seems like a mark of Seoul. When I went there in the daytime, not felt much special. There were some performances right outside the tower, seemed special.",353,much,서울의 상징인 것 같습니다. 낮에 갔을 때는 그다지 특별하게 느껴지지 않았습니다. 타워 바로 바깥에서 일부 공연이 있었는데 특별해 보였습니다.
354,354,354,4247,went here at night time. the attraction is recommended for visit. bring your own couple padlock here to save money :p. the ticket to go up is quite expensive and nothing much at the top. should consider to go up when you are in tight budget.,354,much,밤 시간에 여기에 갔다. 명소를 방문하는 것이 좋습니다. 돈을 절약하기 위해 여기에 자신의 커플 자물쇠를 가져 오십시오 :p. 올라가는 티켓은 꽤 비싸고 정상에는 많지 않습니다. 예산이 빠듯할 때 증가하는 것을 고려해야 합니다.
355,355,355,4248,"Buy a one way ticket up- the lines are long going up, and can be worse coming back down, but much easier to walk down (lots of steps) unless you don't mind spending the extra won and time waiting.",355,much,편도 티켓을 구입하십시오. 줄이 길어지고 다시 내려 오는 것이 더 나빠질 수 있지만 여분의 원과 기다리는 시간을 보내는 데 신경 쓰지 않는 한 걷는 것이 훨씬 쉽습니다 (많은 단계).
356,356,356,4249,I was pleased to send postcards from such place.  The tower itself is only ~200m and it costs 6000w to get to the top. Bit too much considering how hard it is to get there by foot or 8500w cost of round trip in a cable car. Not recommended.,356,much,그런 곳에서 엽서를 보내게 되어 기뻤습니다. 타워 자체는 ~200m에 불과하며 정상에 도달하는 데 6000w가 소요됩니다. 도보로 이동하는 것이 얼마나 어려운지 또는 케이블카에서 왕복 8500w의 비용을 고려하면 조금 너무합니다. 권장하지 않습니다.
357,357,357,4257,"Well if you are visiting Seoul, you can't miss this one...unfortunately nothing remarkable though...you do get a good view of the city but the tower is not really that tall...bit expensive but it's standard for tall towers to charge this much  Nothing great apart from a good view of the city...oh yeah and there is a men's urinal offering a unique view/positioning overlooking the city right 1 level below the observation deck",357,much,"글쎄, 당신이 서울을 방문한다면 이것을 놓칠 수 없다. 불행히도 놀라운 것은 없지만 ... 도시의 좋은 전망을 볼 수 있지만 타워는 실제로 그렇게 높지는 않습니다 ... 약간 비싸지 만 표준입니다. 이만큼 충전할 높은 타워"
358,358,358,4258,"The view is great. You can see Han river, some landmark buildings, hills. You can see various districts of Seoul, skyscrapers next to Yeouido Park, but there is not much more in it. Anyway, it's definitely worth the visit for the view.",358,much,"보기는 훌륭합니다. 한강, 일부 랜드마크 건물, 언덕을 볼 수 있습니다. 서울의 여러 지역, 여의도 공원 옆에 고층 빌딩이 보이지만 그 이상은 없습니다. 어쨌든 전망을 위해 방문할 가치가 있습니다."
359,359,359,4266,"Very nice view overseeing the whole Seoul city from here. Just like Mandalay Hill, Myanmar, I admit that a bit more greener. Admission fees 9,000 Wan. A lot of people young couples and Korean family were her, not much tourist in August and weather please us and clear sky view.  What please me here, I see many lovers, couples, souvenir, Ice cream, sweets, coffee, a good panoramic view, you are not visiting Seoul, if your vacation planner omit this one, we had a good time with students from Myanmar. I miss our guide Ms. Jeinie!",359,much,"여기에서 서울 전체를 내려다보는 아주 멋진 전망. 미얀마의 만달레이 힐과 마찬가지로 조금 더 푸르른 것을 인정합니다. 입장료 9,000원. 많은 젊은 커플과 한국 가족이 그녀였습니다. 8월의 관광객은 많지 않았고 날씨는 우리를 기쁘게 하고 맑은 하늘을 봅니다. 여기에서 나를 기쁘게하는 것은 많은 연인, 커플, 기념품, 아이스크림, 과자, 커피, 좋은 파노라마 전망, 당신은 서울에 가지 않을 것입니다. 당신의 휴가 계획자가 이것을 생략한다면 우리는 미얀마에서 온 학생들과 즐거운 시간을 보냈습니다. 우리 가이드 Ms. Jeinie가 그리워요!"
360,360,360,4305,Such a notable landmark so you really do need to do this at least once. Many nice places for photo opportunities. Seen in many dramas the site where all of the locks from couples are. We went late at night and didn't have much of a wait time. Night view was beautiful though probably day time view would have been better to see all the detail sections of Seoul. But we weren't really wanting to go so bad that we would stand in line for 2 hours as some of the reviews stated. Late night we waited about 10 minutes.,360,much,이러한 주목할만한 랜드 마크이므로 적어도 한 번은해야합니다. 사진을 찍을 수 있는 좋은 장소가 많이 있습니다. 많은 드라마에서 본 커플들의 자물쇠가 다 있는 사이트. 저희는 밤늦게 갔더니 대기시간이 별로 없었어요. 야경은 아름다웠지만 서울의 모든 세부 구간을 보려면 낮에 보는 것이 더 나았을 것입니다. 그러나 우리는 일부 리뷰에서 언급했듯이 2시간 동안 줄을 서서 너무 나빠지고 싶지 않았습니다. 늦은 밤 우리는 약 10 분을 기다렸습니다.
361,361,361,4339,"We made the mistake of hiking up the hill to this tower, it was a nice but extremely steep walk up in killer humidity. There is a lift but we came at it from the wrong direction and never found it, so plan it out properly or you will be sorry like we were! The tower itself is nothing too special, the view is nice and the windows point you in the direction of other countries so that's kind of cool. You can send postcards from the top too. Don't feel too bad if you miss this. Other cities have much better towers.",361,much,우리는 이 탑까지 언덕을 하이킹하는 실수를 저질렀습니다. 그것은 훌륭했지만 살인자 습도까지 매우 가파른 산보였습니다. 리프트가 있지만 잘못된 방향에서 와서 찾지 못했으므로 제대로 계획하지 않으면 우리처럼 죄송합니다! 타워 자체는 그다지 특별하지 않고 전망이 좋고 창문이 다른 나라의 방향을 가리키므로 일종의 시원합니다. 위에서도 엽서를 보낼 수 있습니다. 이것을 놓치더라도 너무 슬퍼하지 마십시오. 다른 도시에는 훨씬 더 나은 타워가 있습니다.
362,362,362,4342,"Our group of 4 walked from Myeongdong to the cable car station at Namsan Hill. Took us 25minutes. The queue for the cable car was relatively short, about 10 minutes as it was a Tuesday evening. Once out of the cable car, you still need to walk up many steps to get to the Seoul tower. There are interesting spots for photography. You have to pay a fee to get up to the observation deck. The night view was lovely. The lighted bridges along the Han River were specially awesome. The quip was that we couldn't take photos as the light from the shop in the tower casted too much reflection on the glass. You can send a postcard back home from there as the shop sells stamps, cards and has a post box! Overall, it was a memorable and fun visit.",362,much,"우리 4인조는 명동에서 남산힐 케이블카 정류장까지 걸어갔다. 25분이 걸렸습니다. 케이블카의 대기줄은 화요일 저녁이라 10분 내외로 비교적 짧았다. 케이블카에서 내리면 서울타워까지는 여전히 많은 계단을 올라야 합니다. 재미있는 사진 촬영 장소가 있습니다. 전망대에 올라가려면 요금을 내야 합니다. 야경이 멋졌습니다. 특히 한강변의 조명이 켜진 다리는 정말 장관이었습니다. 단점은 타워에 있는 상점의 빛이 유리에 너무 많이 반사되어 사진을 찍을 수 없다는 것이었습니다. 가게에서 우표, 카드를 판매하고 우체통이 있기 때문에 거기에서 집으로 엽서를 보낼 수 있습니다! 전반적으로 기억에 남고 재미있는 방문이었습니다."
363,363,363,4349,"I feel like it's worth it. It IS expensive, though. I forget exactly how much, but around 20-30 won per person. But it's beautiful and if you can afford it, I would go.",363,much,그만한 가치가 있는 것 같아요. 하지만 비싸다. 얼마인지는 정확히 기억나지 않지만 1인당 20~30원 정도. 그러나 그것은 아름답고 당신이 그것을 감당할 수 있다면 나는 갈 것입니다.
364,364,364,4360,"I really don't get the appeal of this place...yes, sure, the view is nice from the top, but the cable cars were terribly full and so was the location...there were just too many people to really immerse yourself in the experience. The tower itself is simply a tower which lights up in different colours, it's no architectural masterpiece. If you plan on walking up to the tower be prepared for a very steep ascent with many steps, so bring plenty of water. It's quite a hike to the top, but great exercise. I'd much rather go to one of the city's amazing art exhibitions than see this overcrowded attraction.",364,much,"나는 정말로 장소의 매력을 이해하지 못했습니다 ... 예, 물론, 정상에서보기는 좋지만 케이블카는 끔찍하게 가득차 있었고 위치도 마찬가지였습니다 ... 너무 많은 사람들이 실제로 몰입 할 수 없었습니다. 경험에서 자신. 타워 자체는 단순히 다른 색상으로 빛나는 타워일 뿐이며 건축학적 걸작은 아닙니다. 타워까지 걸어갈 계획이라면 계단이 많이 있는 매우 가파른 오르막을 준비해야 하므로 충분한 물을 가져오세요. 정상까지 가는 것은 꽤 힘들지만 훌륭한 운동입니다. 나는 이 붐비는 명소를 보는 것보다 도시의 놀라운 예술 전시회에 가는 것이 훨씬 낫습니다."
365,365,365,4378,"Tower is pricier than we expected, and it was surprisingly poor visibility at the top. We thought views were equally as nice from Namsan park.  If you decide to go up,sunset is a beautiful it popular time - get there much earlier than you think is necessary, especially if by cable car ad the line backs up quickly.  Best to take the bus to the top, which runs frequently straight to the top since taxis can't go up. Bus stops running earlier though, so plan to walk or take cable car back down mountain if you'll be there later than 9.",365,much,"타워는 우리가 예상했던 것보다 비싸고, 정상에서의 시야는 놀라울 정도로 좋지 않았습니다. 우리는 남산 공원의 전망이 똑같이 좋다고 생각했습니다. 올라가기로 결정했다면 일몰이 아름답고 인기 있는 시간입니다. 특히 케이블카 광고로 줄이 빠르게 백업되는 경우 필요하다고 생각하는 것보다 훨씬 일찍 도착하세요. 택시가 올라갈 수 없기 때문에 정상까지 자주 직진하는 버스를 타는 것이 가장 좋습니다. 그러나 버스는 더 일찍 정차하므로 9시 이후에 도착할 예정이라면 걷거나 케이블카를 타고 다시 산으로 내려오는 것을 계획하세요."
366,366,366,4381,"I was there in September 2014, even though I haven't been to the top of the tower yet but the atmosphere surrounding the tower was fabulous.  My friend and I took a bus from the station, I forgot the name already, and left the bus at the N-tower station. It is an up-hill street which you have to walk till you reach the tower.  I did not enjoy the view that much but the atmosphere was impressive. Families, couples and friends were enjoying their moment together at the tower.  So, I just fall in love with the atmosphere not the tower itself. But such a good place to go indeed.",366,much,"나는 2014년 9월에 거기에 갔지만 아직 타워의 꼭대기에 가보지는 않았지만 타워를 둘러싼 분위기는 환상적이었습니다. 친구와 나는 역에서 버스를 탔는데 이미 이름을 잊어버리고 N타워 역에서 내렸다. 타워에 도달할 때까지 걸어야 하는 오르막 길입니다. 나는 전망을 그다지 즐기지 않았지만 분위기는 인상적이었습니다. 가족, 커플, 친구들이 타워에서 함께 시간을 즐기고 있었습니다. 그래서 나는 타워 자체가 아니라 분위기에 사랑에 빠졌습니다. 하지만 정말 가기 좋은 곳."
367,367,367,4389,"The Seoul Tower in Namsam park really does offer amazing views of the city. I didn't actually go up thought because you can get great views from the base, but Seoul was surprisingly a little smoggy.  The reason I don't give it a full 5 stars is because its very touristy, and there are much nicer places to get beautiful views of the city, of course they may require a bit of hiking, but I think its worth it.",367,much,남삼공원에 있는 서울타워는 정말 도시의 멋진 전망을 제공합니다. 베이스에서 멋진 전망을 볼 수 있기 때문에 실제로 생각하지 않았지만 서울은 놀랍게도 약간 스모그였습니다. 별 5개 만점을 주지 않는 이유는 관광지가 매우 많고 도시의 아름다운 전망을 감상할 수 있는 더 멋진 장소가 있기 때문입니다. 물론 약간의 하이킹이 필요할 수도 있지만 그만한 가치가 있다고 생각합니다.
368,368,368,4392,I went two time nothin the morning and the view is great although I think the night scene on the top of the hill if Nam San should be very good too. Both taking cable car and bus are convenient to coming up but I felt taking bus is better for elderly and not much slop needed for going up to station,368,much,"아침에 2번이나 갔는데 남산산 정상의 야경도 너무 좋았으면 하는 생각이 들지만 뷰는 정말 좋습니다. 케이블카와 버스 모두 오르기 편하지만, 노약자에게는 버스를 타는 것이 더 좋고 역까지 가는데 큰 불편이 없다는 생각이 들었습니다."
369,369,369,4405,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much as there is so many of these views and towers around the world. A friend of mine took me there in the evening and after a while of waiting to get up, the most spectacular view I've ever had in my life appeared. Seoul is an incredible metropolis and the experience of seeing all those lights from the top felt almost incredible. I think I will have this picture in front of my eyes forever! :)",369,much,"솔직히 전 세계에 이런 전망과 타워가 너무 많아서 기대하지 않았습니다. 내 친구가 저녁에 그곳으로 나를 데려갔고, 일어나기 위해 잠시 기다린 후에 내 인생에서 본 것 중 가장 멋진 광경이 나타났습니다. 서울은 놀라운 대도시이며 꼭대기에서 모든 빛을 보는 경험은 거의 믿을 수 없을 정도로 느껴졌습니다. 이 사진은 평생 내 눈앞에 있을 것 같아요! :)"
370,370,370,4410,"You must not visit at night time, otherwise you will not be able to see the view as the glass reflects the interior light. So please visit during the day for a greater experience.  But still it has a great view however I was not able to enjoy much because the windows reflect and there were a lot tourists in a small area.",370,much,야간에는 방문하지 마세요. 유리에 실내 조명이 반사되어 경치를 볼 수 없습니다. 따라서 더 큰 경험을 위해 낮에 방문하십시오. 그래도 뷰는 좋은데 창문에 반사가 되고 협소한 지역에 관광객이 많아서 많이 즐기지는 못했어요.
371,371,371,4411,"I booked a tour to do this so the bus drove us up to a certain point and we walked the other half up. The hill is very steep. You will get a great workout. I do not recommend doing this when it is extremely warm in Korea as the humidity is very high and if you not accustomed to it could cause you great harm.  I was looking forward to seeing the N. Seoul Tower from the minute of booking my trip to Seoul. I booked a nite trip with Koridoor (we stopped at other locations as well as the N.Seoul Tower). The elevator ride up was great. I LOVED the view from up there however trying to take photos were hard because of the glare off the glass so that ruined it for me because I couldn't get the great shots that I wanted to get. If taking pictures really isn't at the top of your list then YES, it is a must see other than that go in the day time and the glares from the indoor lights may not affect your pictures as much as the night time views.  Before going up on the tower there is some areas to sit around and some shops to purchase food/snacks such as Coldstone. They also have the love lock area. You can purchase a lock from inside the gift store and put a lock on there. The view from there reminds of looking out over any city at night. It was great but nothing like looking at it from the Tower itself.",371,much,"나는 버스가 우리를 특정 지점까지 몰고 갔고 우리는 나머지 절반을 걸었을 정도로 이것을 하기 위해 여행을 예약했습니다. 언덕이 매우 가파르다. 당신은 훌륭한 운동을 얻을 것이다. 한국은 습도가 매우 높고, 적응하지 않으면 큰 피해를 입을 수 있기 때문에 한국에서 매우 더울 때는 하지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 서울 여행을 예약하는 순간부터 N.서울타워가 보고 싶었다. 나는 고리도어와 함께 야간 여행을 예약했습니다(우리는 N.Seoul Tower뿐만 아니라 다른 장소에서 멈췄습니다). 엘리베이터 타는 것은 훌륭했습니다. 나는 거기에서 보는 경치를 좋아했지만 사진을 찍으려고 애쓰는 것은 유리의 눈부심 때문에 어려웠습니다. 그래서 내가 얻고 싶은 멋진 사진을 얻을 수 없었기 때문에 그것을 망쳤습니다. 사진을 찍는 것이 목록의 맨 위에 있지 않다면 예, 낮에 가는 것 외에는 반드시 봐야 하며 실내 조명의 눈부심은 야경만큼 사진에 영향을 미치지 않을 수 있습니다. 타워에 올라가기 전에 앉을 수 있는 공간과 Coldstone과 같은 음식/간식을 구입할 수 있는 상점이 있습니다. 그들은 또한 사랑의 자물쇠 영역이 있습니다. 선물 가게 안에서 자물쇠를 사서 거기에 자물쇠를 걸 수 있습니다. 그곳에서 바라보는 경치는 밤에 어떤 도시를 내려다보는 것을 생각나게 합니다. 그것은 훌륭했지만 타워 자체에서 보는 것과 같은 것은 아닙니다."

374,374,374,4435,"Everyone said n Seoul tower is a must-go spot in Seoul. However, when I got there, I felt it was just okay, especially the view from the tower. It is true that I could see the whole city from the tower, but there is seriously nothing much to see. Probably that was because I didn't visit at the right time. And the visit was quite short because the tower is not big either. But the view under the tower is pretty cool. I love the scenery under the tower a lot. And you can breath the fresh air there.",374,much,"모두들 n서울타워는 서울에서 꼭 가봐야 할 곳이라고 했다. 그러나 내가 거기에 도착했을 때, 특히 타워에서 보는 전망이 괜찮다는 것을 느꼈습니다. 타워에서 도시 전체를 볼 수 있었던 것은 사실이지만 심각하게 볼 것이 별로 없습니다. 아마도 제 시간에 방문하지 않았기 때문일 것입니다. 그리고 타워도 크지 않아서 방문시간이 꽤 짧았습니다. 그러나 타워 아래의 전망은 꽤 시원합니다. 나는 타워 아래의 풍경을 아주 좋아합니다. 그리고 그곳에서 신선한 공기를 마실 수 있습니다."

Although pic a day that is clear, when we stayed forecast was Haze everyday but we went regardless. Its obviously a great view being up so high, once at the top of the there are plenty of picture opportunities, there also decent pictures to be taken at the base of the tower. Also the guys washroom is great because the urinals have the most amazing view you've ever had while reliving yourself. We went on a weekday i think its slightly cheaper than the weekend but really our currency is valued much higher than theirs so most everything is relatively inexpensive. There is also a tram that can take you up and down, we decided to take it down and it was an ok view, 6000 won one way per person.",377,much,"2015년 6월 24일에 타워를 확인했습니다. 투어 버스 중 하나를 사용하여 매우 쉽게 접근할 수 있습니다. 약 1300원 또는 $1.25 USD입니다. 사진은 맑은 날이지만 우리가 머물렀을 때 일기예보는 매일 안개였지만 우리는 아무렇지도 않게 갔다. 분명히 멋진 전망이 너무 높아서 일단 정상에 오르면 많은 사진 기회가 있고, 타워 바닥에서도 괜찮은 사진을 찍을 수 있습니다. 또한 남자 화장실은 소변기가 자신을 재현하는 동안 본 것 중 가장 놀라운 전망을 가지고 있기 때문에 훌륭합니다. 우리는 평일에 갔고 주말보다 약간 저렴하다고 생각하지만 실제로 우리 통화는 그들의 통화보다 훨씬 높게 평가되어 대부분의 모든 것이 상대적으로 저렴합니다. 위아래로 탈 수 있는 트램도 있는데 우리는 내리기로 결정했고 1인당 편도 6000원으로 괜찮은 전망이었다."
378,378,378,4454,"I went with my mum on a cold night. Fog was everywhere, but decided to take the risk and head up. Caught the cable car to the tower. Only a 15 minute walk from our hotel (Nine Tree in Myeongdong). We waited about an hour for the fog to dissappear, then paid to go up. Again, waited a while inside for the fog to go. Only a restaurant and a few coffee bars inside. Not much else to do inside other than the gift shop. Saw a review on TripAdvisor that said the best view was from the ladies toilets. Strange thing to say, but so true !! The view from outside was just as impressive. The amount of love padlocks there was overwhelming; (being a k-drama fan made being there even more special!). The view of Seoul was stunning, and worth the cold wait !",378,much,"나는 추운 밤에 엄마와 함께 갔다. 안개가 도처에 있었지만 위험을 감수하고 위로 가기로 결정했습니다. 타워로 가는 케이블카를 탔다. 저희 호텔(명동 나인트리)에서 도보로 단 15분 거리에 있습니다. 우리는 안개가 사라질 때까지 한 시간 정도 기다렸다가 돈을 지불하고 올라갔습니다. 다시, 안개가 갈 때까지 안에서 잠시 기다렸다. 레스토랑과 몇 개의 커피 바만 내부에 있습니다. 기념품 가게 외에는 내부에서 할 일이별로 없습니다. 최고의 전망은 여성용 화장실에서였다는 트립어드바이저 리뷰를 보았습니다. 말이 이상하지만 사실입니다!! 외부에서 보는 전망도 인상적이었습니다. 사랑의 자물쇠가 엄청나게 많았습니다. (K-드라마 팬이 되어 그곳에 있는 것이 더욱 특별해졌습니다!). 서울의 전망은 충격적이었고 추위를 기다릴 가치가있었습니다!"
379,379,379,4464,"I've been here once before so I knew what to expect. But I didn't get that. Maybe their budget was cut, or maybe it was MERS to blame, but...  The exhibition, one of those live art deals where you can be a part of the art, was quite lame. I guess it was exactly as described but the atmosphere was empty and there's just not much excitement to have when you can really only do the pose they show you, nothing unique about your experience.  Then there's a SECOND hall, which looked totally devoid of people and I can see why. One is enough.  Going up to the observatory and you get the good views. I've been up enough buildings to know this is your bog standard deal. I actually found the 63 building view to be far superior, because you're closer to stuff for viewing, not up a mountain. the 63 building is in a place where you can see all the traffic and detail, and it's such an unpopular tourist attraction nowadays it takes no time and you get to see all round. So maybe check that out instead.  When I left, I expected the scheduled lights display on the Seoul Tower, which, when I was there a few years back came with music and 3d laser stuff and animations on the floor. This time, I got what seemed to be 3 minutes of silent advertisement on the tower, and nothing else. What an incredible disappointment. I was building up to that moment the whole time. I can only hope it was a one-off thing due to MERS.  Getting back down is hugely inconvenient since there are no taxis or buses, so you have to get this weird elevator down a side cliff, onto the road and walk 15 minutes or so to the subway. And there were no directions or instructions on how to do that; I had to ask a car park ticket officer.",379,much,"나는 전에 한 번 여기에 있었기 때문에 무엇을 기대해야하는지 알고있었습니다. 그러나 나는 그것을 이해하지 못했다. 예산이 줄었거나 메르스 탓이었을 수도 있지만... 예술의 일부가 될 수 있는 라이브 아트 거래 중 하나인 이번 전시회는 정말 형편없었습니다. 나는 그것이 정확히 설명된 대로라고 생각하지만 분위기는 텅 비어 있었고 그들이 보여주는 포즈만 할 수 있을 때 갖는 흥분은 별로 없고 경험에 대한 독특한 것은 없습니다. 그런 다음 완전히 사람이 없어 보이는 SECOND 홀이 있습니다. 그리고 나는 그 이유를 알 수 있습니다. 하나면 충분합니다. 전망대에 오르면 좋은 전망을 볼 수 있습니다. 나는 이것이 당신의 늪지 표준 거래라는 것을 알기에 충분히 건물을 올라갔습니다. 나는 실제로 63 빌딩 뷰가 훨씬 더 우수하다는 것을 알았습니다. 왜냐하면 산이 아니라 볼 수있는 물건에 더 가깝기 때문입니다. 63 빌딩은 모든 교통과 세부 사항을 볼 수있는 장소에 있으며 요즘에는 인기가없는 관광 명소로 시간이 걸리지 않고 모든 것을 볼 수 있습니다. 그러니 대신 확인해 보세요. 내가 떠날 때 나는 서울 타워에 예정된 조명이 표시되기를 기대했는데, 몇 년 전에 내가 거기에 있었을 때 바닥에 음악과 3D 레이저 물건과 애니메이션이 함께 제공되었습니다. 이번에는 타워에 3분 정도의 묵직한 광고처럼 보이는 것을 얻었고 그 외에는 아무 것도 없었습니다. 정말 놀라운 실망입니다. 나는 그 순간까지 내내 쌓아왔다. 메르스로 인한 일회성 이었길 바랄 뿐입니다. 다시 내려오는 것은 택시나 버스가 없어 매우 불편하기 때문에 이 기이한 엘리베이터를 타고 옆 절벽을 따라 도로 위로 올라가 지하철까지 15분 정도 걸어가야 합니다. 그리고 그렇게 하는 방법에 대한 지시나 지시도 없었습니다. 주차장 매표원에게 물어봐야 했다."

The kids enjoyed themselves and the scenary. My husband who is not fit at all, didn't soo much mind the hike as well. Granted the air quality wasn't so great that day but it was good quality time. I've jogged up the never ending road a few times for a good cardio workout but if you're looking for a good leisurely hike to enjoy with the family highly recommend it.  Getting to the actual tower is a disappointment. Once at the top we couldn't really see much past the US Army base at the foot of the hill because the pollution was bad. We weren't too happy about the condition of the tourist area...looks like the cleaning crew from the night didn't do anything as trash was all over the place. It seemed very dirty in the seated viewing area. We were there at 8am, so perhaps they only do cleaning later in the morning...but for a place that attracts a lot of tourists highly recommend they have it presentable all the time.  Would have given it high rating if it was cleaner. So i'm giving it only very good rating for only the actual hike.",380,much,아이들(4세 및 6세)과 함께 이 하이킹을 정말 좋아합니다. 힐튼 밀레니엄 호텔 사거리에서 출발하여 계단을 올라갔습니다. 아이들은 자신과 경치를 즐겼습니다. 몸이 전혀 좋지 않은 남편도 하이킹에 그다지 신경 쓰지 않았습니다. 그날 공기 질이 그렇게 좋지는 않았지만 좋은 품질의 시간이었습니다. 나는 좋은 유산소 운동을 위해 끝없는 길을 몇 번 조깅했지만 가족과 함께 즐기기에 좋은 한가로운 하이킹을 찾고 있다면 적극 추천합니다. 실제 타워에 도착하는 것은 실망입니다. 일단 정상에 오르면 오염이 나빴기 때문에 언덕 기슭에 있는 미군 기지를 지나서 많이 볼 수 없었습니다. 우리는 관광 지역의 상태에 대해 너무 행복하지 않았습니다. . . 쓰레기가 도처에 있었기 때문에 밤부터 청소 직원이 아무것도하지 않은 것 같습니다. 좌석이 있는 관람석이 많이 더러워 보였습니다. 우리는 오전 8시에 거기에 있었으므로 아마도 아침 늦게만 청소를 했을 것입니다. 하지만 많은 관광객을 끌어들이는 장소를 위해 그들은 항상 그것을 보여줄 수 있도록 강력히 추천합니다. 더 깨끗했다면 높은 점수를 주었을 것입니다. 그래서 나는 단지 실제 하이킹에 대해서만 아주 좋은 평가를 주고 있습니다.

There's love bridge alike section where people hang their locks on it for wish. My advise is, bring your own lock because it might be costly to purchase there. Go to the observatory tower only your travel budget allow because there's nothing much fun except that you can view the scenery in higher position. It is recommended to go there in the evening before the sun goes down, then you can view the scenery of Seoul in day and night time.

382,382,382,4547,We went probably on the wrong day. Saturday evening there were far too many people. Buying the tickets took over 45 minutes and helpfully the lady at the counter told us that the trip to the tower would take another 90 minutes of waiting. And there are not much places to wait! About 2 hours later we were called to board the lift to the observation deck on the top floor. By this time it had started raining and the view was hindered by the water drops on the glass panes of the observatory. So not sure if it was worth the wait.,382,much,우리는 아마도 잘못된 날에 갔을 것입니다. 토요일 저녁은 사람이 너무 많았다. 티켓을 사는 데 45분이 넘게 걸렸고 도움이 되는 카운터의 아주머니는 타워까지 가는 데 90분이 더 걸릴 것이라고 말했습니다. 그리고 대기할 곳이 별로 없어요! 약 2시간 후 우리는 최상층 전망대로 올라가는 리프트에 탑승하라는 부름을 받았습니다. 이때부터 비가 내리기 시작했고 전망대 유리창에 떨어지는 물방울로 인해 시야가 흐려졌습니다. 그래서 기다릴 가치가 있는지 확실하지 않습니다.

384,384,384,4572,"Wow! This is a must to do adventure while visiting Seoul. I would recommend that you take the public transportation (bus) and plan about 4 hours (includes the bus trip) for your trip to the tower. It was definitely more interesting than I thought it would be to see how densely populated and the number of high rise apartment and office buildings make up Seoul and with almost every flat piece of land having a high rise on it. I am glad I arrived early in the day (9:45am) as many more people were arriving when I left. This is great way to get your bearings and understand the layout of Seoul. Also important for you to know that they take everyones picture before you step in the elevators and sell them to you at the top at the observation deck. The park like setting on the walk up the hill is very nice. I was also surprised to see the many love locks connected to the fences and other areas at this site. This was made popular by a Korean soap opera and considered very romantic thing to do...which I agree is.  Tips -go early -bring a camera -bring two locks; one for you and your loved one, to add to the many already there...very romantic -purchase the ticket with the popcorn/drink --best deal -plan to eat lunch in downtown Seoul as the food choices are much better",384,much,"우와! 이것은 서울을 방문하는 동안 모험을해야합니다. 대중교통(버스)을 타고 타워까지 가는데 약 4시간(버스 포함)을 계획하는 것을 추천합니다. 서울을 구성하는 인구 밀도와 고층 아파트 및 사무실 건물의 수와 거의 모든 평평한 땅에 고층 건물이 있는 것을 보는 것은 생각했던 것보다 확실히 더 흥미로웠습니다. 내가 떠났을 때 더 많은 사람들이 도착하고 있었기 때문에 이른 시간 (9:45am)에 도착한 것이 기쁩니다. 이것은 방향을 잡고 서울의 레이아웃을 이해하는 좋은 방법입니다. 또한 엘리베이터를 타기 전에 모두 사진을 찍어 전망대 꼭대기에서 판매한다는 것을 아는 것도 중요합니다. 언덕을 오르는 길에 조성된 공원은 매우 좋습니다. 나는 또한이 사이트의 울타리와 다른 영역에 연결된 많은 사랑의 자물쇠를보고 놀랐습니다. 이것은 한국 연속극에 의해 인기를 얻었고 매우 낭만적인 일이라고 여겨졌습니다... 저도 동의합니다. 팁 - 일찍 가세요 - 카메라를 가져오세요 - 자물쇠 두 개를 가져오세요. 당신과 당신의 사랑하는 사람을 위한 하나, 이미 거기에 있는 많은 것에 추가하기 위해...매우 낭만적인 - 팝콘/음료와 함께 티켓을 구입하십시오 - 최고의 거래 - 음식 선택이 훨씬 더 좋기 때문에 서울 시내에서 점심을 먹을 계획"

I would also say it is not the worth the trip to see just the tower, there are a few parks and recreational rooms (karoake, pc rooms, bars etc. ) nearby to make going to this part of Seoul worth it.",386,much,"우리는 올라가지 않았고, 타워 옆에 언덕 위로 계단이 꽤 있어서 거의 비슷한 전망을 무료로 제공했습니다. 나는 또한 타워만 보는 여행의 가치가 없다고 말하고 싶습니다. 서울의 이 부분에 갈 가치가 있는 공원과 오락실(노래방, PC방, 바 등)이 근처에 몇 개 있습니다."
387,387,387,4596,I liked the visiting of the Tower very much. The way to it was spectacular. You can walk and relax. Once there you can enjoy the fontain which breezes you with almost invisible drops - lovely feeling. Than there is good choice of restaurants or bistros to eat. The tower itself is very difficult to observe if you are staying just underneath. And of course the funicular experience added a very nice atmosphere to that relaxed visit.,387,much,나는 타워 방문을 매우 좋아했습니다. 가는 길은 장관이었다. 산책과 휴식을 취할 수 있습니다. 거기에 가면 거의 눈에 띄지 않는 물방울로 기분을 상쾌하게 만드는 퐁텐을 즐길 수 있습니다. 사랑스러운 느낌입니다. 먹을 수 있는 레스토랑이나 비스트로를 선택하는 것이 좋습니다. 타워 자체는 바로 아래에 있으면 관찰하기가 매우 어렵습니다. 그리고 물론 케이블카 체험은 그 편안한 방문에 아주 좋은 분위기를 더했습니다.

So all I can say is that on an overcast kinda day, I would just walk around the grounds and maybe do all the FREE things. Going all the way up to the top was nice, but we didn't really get a good view. After we got back down, we realized there was a place for us to walk up to (the deck with all the love locks) and that provided the same kinda of view from up top considering the condition of the sky. So we kinda regretted even paying.",388,much,"한국을 여행하는 대부분의 기간 동안 하늘은 매우 스모그 또는 흐려 보였습니다. 그래서 우리가 갔을 때 선택의 여지가 많지 않았습니다. 그래서 내가 말할 수 있는 것은 흐린 날에는 그냥 경내를 돌아다니며 모든 무료 활동을 할 것이라는 것뿐입니다. 꼭대기까지 올라가는 것은 좋았지만 우리는 실제로 좋은 전망을 얻지 못했습니다. 우리가 다시 내려온 후, 우리는 우리가 걸어갈 수 있는 장소가 있다는 것을 깨달았습니다. 그래서 우리는 지불하는 것조차 약간 후회했습니다."

I suggest going at night because the view of Seoul is breath taking. It is amazing to see how much Seoul changed from my time as a kid in the '80s until now. I wish the Army would allow me to stay longer but unfortunately that is not an option.  Check out the Bear Museum inside. I know the kids will get a kick out of it and don't forget the skydeck.

To reach the tower you will have to walk around half KM from nearest bus stop and metro.  You can either walk all the way to the top, which can be bit taxing. Or take the option that I took, of taking cable car from mid way of the hill to the tower.  Do note that cable car entry may become crowded and will require you to wait for getting your turn.  Once in the tower complex you need to collect ticket for going to top of the tower in lift. View from is great, though you get a feeling that they have tried a bit to replicate Eiffel tower.

The hike itself was really nice, and there were many different flowers and trees bordering the trail. Unfortunately, the view wasn't so spectacular since it was so humid and foggy the day that I went.  At the top, they definitely play up the love theme with heart flower arrangements, the chance to buy lover's locks (if you didn't bring your own) and attach it to the lock trees, and the benches are slanted inwards so that you sit closer to your loved one. I went to the restaurant on the main floor which was a bit pricey (also decided going up wasn't worth the $$ since you already can see out at the main level).  I think that other times during the year (Spring or Fall when it isn't so muggy) the view would be much nicer, or even at night when the tower is lit up.

The reality, however; left much to be desired.  1. the line: there was a huge line to buy tickets, and to wait for the lift, and again to come back down the mountain, mostly by local tourists and chinese tourists who come as groups or individually. a wildly popular korean drama had some scenes here, so i suppose that's the main reason for the upsurge in popularity. i came here with my girlfriend late at night, around 9PM (the lifts close at ten), hoping to avoid the crowds, but still managed to wait for over an hour all together to go up and come down. We spent no more than 15 min on the top.  2. the prices were expensive, you pay for the cable car, as well as the elevator in the tower, which is only 200 something meters, furthermore, the Seoul skyline isn't all that attractive to be honest, don't get me wrong, i love the city's youthful energy and friendly people, its just that as a city, it is nowhere near NYC, HK, Shanghai, or Paris in terms of grandeur or overall aesthetic effect on the eye. For me, it was really just a bunch of high rises in the distance and tourists and souvenir stalls next to me. So unfortunately, I was left rather disappointed by the visit.",415,much,"서울 타워는 남산에 위치하고 있어 서울 스카이라인의 멋진 전망을 감상할 수 있을 것입니다. 그러나 현실은; 많이 남았습니다. 1. 줄 : 표를 사고, 리프트를 기다리고, 다시 산으로 내려오기 위해 엄청난 줄을 섰다. 주로 단체나 개인으로 오는 현지 관광객과 중국 관광객들이 많았다. 한국에서 인기를 끌었던 드라마가 몇 장면 있었는데, 그게 인기가 급상승한 가장 큰 이유인 것 같아요. 나는 밤 늦게 여자 친구와 함께 군중을 피하기 위해 오후 9시경(엘리베이터가 10시에 닫힘)에 왔지만 여전히 함께 올라가고 내려오기까지 1시간 이상을 기다릴 수 있었습니다. 우리는 정상에서 15 분 이상을 보내지 않았습니다. 2. 가격이 비쌌고, 케이블카와 타워의 엘리베이터도 200미터 밖에 안 되는 거리에, 더군다나 서울의 스카이라인은 솔직히 매력적이지 않습니다. 틀렸습니다. 저는 이 도시의 젊음의 에너지와 친절한 사람들을 사랑합니다. 도시로서 웅장함이나 전체적인 미학적 효과 측면에서 NYC, HK, 상하이 또는 파리 근처에 없다는 것입니다. 저에게는 정말 저 멀리 보이는 고층 건물들과 제 옆에 관광객들과 기념품 가게들이 가득했습니다. 그래서 불행히도 나는 방문에 다소 실망했습니다."
416,416,416,4849,"(Arrival) You have to stay calm because of the crowd. I went in the evening, so did many others. The prospect of viewing Seoul's night lights seem enticing. I faced about an hour's wait to go into the lift to bring the visitors up the observatory. I don't mind the wait, but there were not enough seats or rest areas for people who were waiting. Some, just made themselves comfortable on the floor. For me, i found an air con draft and stood at the same spot for almost 1 hour. Note: If you are coming by bus, there is a steep hill for you to conquer, so advisable to have comfortable walking shoes on.  (Wait is over.. or is it...) The lift ride simulated, somewhat like a rocket taking off, with effects and all. Frankly, I din enjoy it that much because we were all packed like sardines in the lift. SO instead of going ""wow.. look at the cool effects on the ceiling of the lift.."".. I was hoping the lift ride will end ASAP.  (View from the top) The view from the observatory was great. Crowds get into your face sometimes. Some will hog the glass panels and rest themselves at the panels / selfies etc. so STAY CALM.. and wait or walk around before coming back. They have the signs that will point in the direction of you hometown, stating the distance you are away from home. There is a mailbox at the souvenir shop. Apparently, it's the 'highest' postbox or something. Many people were trying to send postcards (purchased from the shop) back home to their loved ones. Do have a pen with you if you intend on doing so.  (Final comments) Interesting experience, but my wait and travel is much longer than the time i spend there. Nice scenery but I won't be going back if i return to Seoul.",416,much,"(도착) 인파가 많으니 침착해야 합니다. 나는 저녁에 갔고 다른 사람들도 많이 갔다. 서울의 야간 조명을 볼 수 있다는 전망은 매력적으로 보입니다. 나는 방문객들을 전망대로 데려오기 위해 리프트를 타기 위해 약 1시간을 기다려야 했다. 웨이팅은 상관없지만 기다리는 사람들을 위한 좌석이나 쉼터가 부족했습니다. 일부는 바닥에서 편안하게 지냈습니다. 저에게는 에어콘 드래프트를 발견하고 거의 1시간 동안 같은 자리에 서 있었습니다. 참고: 버스로 오시는 경우 가파른 언덕을 정복해야 하므로 편안한 운동화를 신는 것이 좋습니다.

Once up at the top, via a very speedy lift, we were treated to good views over Seoul. It was a clear day with no smog over the city. Unfortunately, the top is very busy a d many visitors smear their hands over the windows meaning you cannot really get good shots of the cityscape. Also, because of the huge footfall there are no comfy chairs to sit and relax up there.  The floor just below the top is less busy and for the men you can pee with a view. On this floor there is more information on the windows as to what you are looking at but again the windows are dirty. On this floor there is a coffee shop but the queue for the lift winds its way through the seating area.  We had good views but the huge number of people and dirty windows meant you couldn't really appreciate the cityscape as much as you would want. It costs 9,000 won per adult to visit. We walked up through the nature trails behind the tower. They are not clearly narked but if you just head in the direction of the tower you'll be fine. There were only a handful of people here.

I would definitely go in the evening as the neon light look much better for photograph!",423,much,우리는 아침에 거기에 갔다. 작은 쇼를보기 위해 엘리베이터의 천장을 올려다 보는 것처럼 타워를 올라가는 것은 재미 있습니다. 타워는 도시의 조감도를 제공합니다. 그러나 스모그는 아침에 거기에 있었고 스모그가 사라질 때까지 나중에 가는 것이 더 나을 것 같습니다. 네온 불빛이 사진에 훨씬 더 잘 보이기 때문에 나는 확실히 저녁에 갈 것입니다!

The second I went was around Chuseok September 2012. A bit quieter since it was around the holidays, but they had traditional crafts and such. The third time I went was January 2013. It was freeezing, but there was so much to do! There was jump roping, traditional games, street artists, bands...it was amazing.  If you're in Seoul you have to come to N Seoul Tower.

I’d read about the locks in my guidebook but it simply described the sight as being ‘trees’ covered with padlocks which symbolise eternal love. I knew to expect a few of these trees, but much to my surprise, I was greeted with an entire kaleidoscopic fence full of padlocks, key rings, phone cases, tags, hearts and toys - there was such an array of dazzling paraphernalia attached to the railings!  I spent nearly an hour taking in the sight before me, reading through the many names & notes appearing on the locks. Some of the messages were concise & to the point; others had a lifetime of thought & emotion put into them; all amounted to an astonishing display of collective happiness in the form of symbolic expression.  As for the view from the top of the tower? Well, it was pretty neat, but a little too smoggy to be considered spectacular. The monochrome picture from the heavens didn’t quite match the vividity of the scene below.  Promise me you visit the love locks if you ever find yourself at N Seoul Tower!  Perhaps you can even fasten one to the fence yourself?",425,much,"나는 위의 전망대에서 도시의 불규칙한 모습을 보기 위한 단순한 의도로 The N 서울 타워에 갔지만, 가장 내 감각을 자극한 것은 아래에 있는 '러브 락'의 유명한 컬렉션이었다. 나는 가이드북에서 자물쇠에 대해 읽었지만 영원한 사랑을 상징하는 자물쇠로 덮인 '나무'로 그 광경을 묘사했습니다. 나는 이 나무들 중 몇 그루를 기대하고 있었지만 훨씬 더 놀랍게도 자물쇠, 열쇠 고리, 전화 케이스, 꼬리표, 하트, 장난감으로 가득 찬 만화경 울타리 전체를 맞이했습니다. 난간! 나는 자물쇠에 나타나는 많은 이름과 메모를 읽으면서 거의 한 시간을 내 앞의 광경을 바라보는 데 보냈습니다. 메시지 중 일부는 간결하고 요점에 충실했습니다. 다른 사람들은 일생 동안 생각과 감정을 쏟아부었습니다. 모두 상징적 표현의 형태로 집단적 행복을 놀랍게 표현한 것이었습니다. 타워 위에서 바라보는 전망은? 글쎄, 그것은 꽤 깔끔했지만 장관으로 간주되기에는 약간 너무 연기가 자욱했습니다. 하늘에서 찍은 흑백 사진은 아래 장면의 선명도와 어울리지 않았습니다.

You may also take a bus or cable car to go there.  If you take a bus, you will have to walk uphill bout 10 minutes (depends). Other attractions nearby, such as Alive Museum and famous love-locks place are worth visiting if you have extra time to spend. You'll have to buy the ticket before proceeds to observation deck.

KRW15000 (observatory deck + Alive Museum) Sending postcard from observation deck: approx. KRW1000++ with stamp  It's such a nice place for photo sessions (despite it was really windy when we went there). The love-lock thing is so fun to do, and the view of Seoul from observation deck is just mesmerizing. I heard it is much fun at night, but I prefer morning as the view is clearer.

Of course, you have to get to the tower first, which can vary in price and time, depending on if you take a bus, the (expensive) lift system or walk the whole way (not recommended unless you have a lot of time in Seoul). The food at the top is also expensive, so eat in advance, or bring snacks during your time at the tower.  I recommend taking a hike on one of the mountains in Seoul instead. It is a great way to get some exercise, spend some time with your friends or family, and the view is much better. Trust me. You will appreciate the scenery much more on the mountains.

I'd recommend walking through namsan Park if you can and are willing to (it's quite a bit of exercise). Otherwise just go there once, enjoy the view as much as you can, it's worthwhile one time. Cheers :)",436,much,관광지이지만 한번쯤은 볼만한 가치가 있는 곳입니다. 나는 일몰에 가는 것을 추천하고 아마도 가을에 가장 아름다울 것입니다. 서울의 전망은 매우 놀랍습니다. 도시의 끝이 보이지 않는 곳에서는 형태가 믿기지 않을 것입니다. 나는 당신이 할 수 있고 의향이 있다면 남산 공원을 산책하는 것을 추천합니다. 그렇지 않으면 한 번 거기에 가서 가능한 한 많이 경치를 즐기십시오. 한 번 가치가 있습니다. 건배 :)
437,437,437,5039,"Basically, there is nothing special about this place. But there is a Teddy Bear museum here and I think if you are not be able to visit Jeju Island for original Teddy Bear museum, this place is a great choice. I don't really recommend going up N Seoul Tower because there is a place which is much nicer than N Seoul Tower and it is 63 Building. Instead of N Seoul Tower, I think 63 Building has a much nicer view to see (especially night view). However, if you do have time, try to visit both places and compare it yourself.",437,much,기본적으로 이곳에는 특별한 것이 없습니다. 하지만 이곳에 테디베어 박물관이 있어서 제주도에 오리지널 테디베어 박물관을 방문할 수 없다면 이곳이 좋은 선택이 아닐까 생각합니다. N서울타워보다 훨씬 멋진 곳이 있고 63빌딩이 있기 때문에 별로 추천하고 싶지는 않습니다. N서울타워보다는 63빌딩이 뷰(특히 야경)가 훨씬 좋은 것 같아요. 그러나 시간이 되시면 두 곳을 직접 방문하여 비교해 보십시오.
438,438,438,5050,"Came here after our visit to Namsamgol Hanok Village. There were a few direct city bus from the village to Mt Namsan. From there, a manageable steep accent to the tower. I find the tickets way overpriced. There is nothing much on top and it was over-crowded and noisy. Apparently those who went up hang around (with the steep price, I can understand why) and it was hard to properly enjoy the view. I went there while the sun was setting and it was nice to see the sunset hues and then quickly turning dark (it was winter time). It was a good way to appreciate the city though ... Seoul is really huge...and the roads are all glittering with cars stuck in the jam :)",438,much,"남삼골 한옥 마을을 방문한 후 여기에 왔습니다. 마을에서 남산으로 가는 직행 시내버스가 몇 대가 있었다. 거기에서 타워까지 관리할 수 있는 가파른 악센트가 있습니다. 나는 티켓이 너무 비싸다고 생각합니다. 정상에는 아무것도 없고 너무 붐비고 시끄럽습니다. 분명히 올라간 사람들은 주위를 어슬렁거렸고(비싼 가격에, 나는 이해할 수 있었다), 제대로 보기를 즐기기 어려웠다. 나는 해가 질 때 갔고 일몰의 색조를보고 빨리 어두워지는 것을 보는 것이 좋았습니다 (겨울철). 그래도 서울을 제대로 감상할 수 있는 좋은 방법이었습니다... 서울은 정말 넓습니다... 그리고 도로는 온통 잼에 갇힌 차들로 반짝이고 있습니다 :)"

Some people comment on the view but lets be honest here, the view is very subjective and also it depends on the city.  Anyway, the N Seoul Tower. I went both at night and day time. It really depends when you go. I took the cable car at night around 8pm, i didn't need to wait that long. I think maybe around 10~15mins time. The cable car is a bit pricey i thought but its an experience and most tourist will never know until they took it. Alternatively, you can take the bus there at a much lower cost.  I think one of the attractions was the safe/lock thing where many couples, friends and family (me included) purchased a lock and lock there. Of course some would say its not worth it and stuff like that but what I can tell you is that it really depends what your looking for. For me, i do it as an experience and memory so i think its worth it. Even if you don't purchase a lock and lock it there, its an experience to see how many people visited Seoul.

457,457,457,5228,"Often in a new city, I do take the effort to visit towers or tall buildings with observation decks given my line of work. I don't often enjoy them given how most of these visits are often crammed full with tourists, usually over-priced, and due to the nature of having to move vertically - you have to endure packed elevators on top of the lines. Still, I do make the effort if I have the time and there are the occasional highlights - plus some cities really look so much better from up high.  The N Seoul Tower in Seoul, South Korea is definitely one of the pluses in my book. Although in terms of infrastructure there really isn't anything remarkably different about the N Seoul Tower, I definitely enjoyed my visit there and count it as among the highlights of my week long Seoul adventure.  One of the major attractions of the N Seoul Tower is its location atop the scenic Namsan mountain in the centre of the city. The tower is fringed by nature and the absence of cars gives the space a certain serenity that's marred only by the shuttle buses that ply the route up. It's definitely worthwhile making your way here just to enjoy the view from the base of the tower, soaking in nature's splendour and enjoying an ice cream from one of the many retailers here. I was here in Spring so the weather was crisp, cool and really almost perfect.  The N Seoul Tower has a unique positioning as the place for love with many love-smitten folks hanging padlocks declaring their everlasting bonds on structures and fences at the base. It makes for some pretty ornaments (albeit expensive ones) but really, this notion of public testaments of love seems pretty tacky. Plus the whole idea of a padlock reminds me more of a prison than love but hey, that's my opinion entirely.  The good thing about the 'love connection' here at the tower is that it lends the whole space a whole lot more charm and appeal. And the management of the place obviously knows this and uses this to their benefit well what with couple benches and love-themed souvenirs. Towers and tall buildings can be sterile and industrial so this lovey-dovey angle is really a compelling angle to have.  As compelling as the site is, the star of course is the tower itself. The N Seoul Tower has a few observatory levels including two restaurants. I only did the views so can't comment on the dining options up high. Tickets are not as pricy as some other towers starting at around RM24 (USD8) which is really pretty decent. There's a combo ticket option which gives you entry to the Teddy Bear Museum also located onsite which I highly recommend.  The tower visit itself is fairly generic. You have a fancy elevator ride up that's decked out with multimedia (this time on the elevator roof). The observatory levels offer great views and there are retail outlets too offering gifts and snacks. One nice addition is the opportunity to send a postcard overseas from the little 'postal office' there. I also liked how they indicated the distance to other major Asian cities on the glass windows based on the direction you are facing. I can see many tourists looking for 'home' and I did too.  So if you ever find yourself in Seoul, do check out the N Seoul Tower. If you do a relaxed visit with a meal, the Teddy Bear Museum and a walk around the site thrown in, it's a good half day at least. Check out the main website for access information and hours and I've heard that the night view is stunning. Definitely a site I will recommend.",457,much,"종종 새로운 도시에서 나는 내 업무 라인에 따라 전망대가 있는 고층 빌딩이나 타워를 방문하려고 노력합니다. 나는 이러한 방문의 대부분이 일반적으로 비싼 가격에 관광객으로 가득 찬 경우가 많고 수직으로 움직여야 하는 특성으로 인해 줄 위에서 붐비는 엘리베이터를 견뎌야 한다는 점을 감안할 때 자주 방문하지 않습니다. 그래도 시간이 있고 가끔 하이라이트가 있는 경우에는 노력을 기울이고 있습니다. 게다가 일부 도시는 위에서 보면 훨씬 더 좋아 보입니다. 한국 서울의 N 서울 타워는 확실히 내 책의 장점 중 하나입니다. 인프라 측면에서 N 서울 타워와 크게 다른 점은 없지만 나는 그곳을 확실히 즐겼고 일주일 동안의 서울 모험의 하이라이트 중 하나로 여기고 있습니다. N서울타워의 가장 큰 매력 중 하나는 도심 한가운데 있는 아름다운 남산 정상에 위치한다는 것입니다. 타워는 자연에 둘러싸여 있으며 차가 없는 공간은 경로를 운행하는 셔틀 버스에 의해서만 손상되는 특정 고요함을 제공합니다. 타워 기슭에서 경치를 즐기고 자연의 아름다움에 몸을 담그고 여기에 있는 많은 소매점 중 한 곳에서 아이스크림을 즐기기 위해 이곳으로 가는 것은 확실히 가치가 있습니다. 나는 봄에 여기에 갔기 때문에 날씨는 파삭 파삭하고 시원하며 거의 완벽했습니다. N 서울 타워는 사랑에 빠진 많은 사람들이 기지의 구조물과 울타리에 영원한 유대를 선언하는 자물쇠를 걸고 있는 사랑의 장소라는 독특한 위치를 가지고 있습니다. 그것은 (비싼 장식품이기는 하지만) 예쁜 장식품을 만들기는 하지만, 사실, 사랑에 대한 공개적인 증거에 대한 이 개념은 꽤 촌스러워 보입니다. 게다가 자물쇠에 대한 모든 아이디어는 사랑보다 감옥을 더 생각나게 하지만 이봐, 그건 전적으로 내 생각이야. 여기 타워의 '사랑의 연결'의 좋은 점은 전체 공간을 훨씬 더 매력과 매력을 부여한다는 것입니다. 그리고 장소의 관리는 이것을 분명히 알고 커플 벤치와 사랑 테마 기념품으로 무엇을 잘 활용합니다. 타워와 고층 건물은 메마르고 산업적일 수 있으므로 이 사랑스러운 각도는 정말 매력적인 각도입니다. 사이트가 매력적이기는 하지만 스타는 물론 타워 자체입니다. N 서울 타워에는 2개의 레스토랑을 포함한 몇 개의 전망대가 있습니다. 나는 단지 전망을 보았으므로 높은 식사 옵션에 대해 언급 할 수 없습니다. 티켓은 약 RM24(USD8)에서 시작하는 다른 타워만큼 비싸지 않습니다. 현장에 있는 테디베어 박물관에 입장할 수 있는 콤보 티켓 옵션이 있어 적극 추천합니다. 타워 방문 ​​자체는 상당히 일반적입니다. 멀티미디어로 장식된 멋진 엘리베이터가 있습니다(이번에는 엘리베이터 지붕에서). 전망대 층은 멋진 전망을 제공하며 선물과 스낵을 제공하는 소매점도 있습니다. 좋은 추가 기능 중 하나는 그곳의 작은 '우체국'에서 엽서를 해외로 보낼 수 있는 기회입니다. 바라보는 방향에 따라 유리창으로 아시아 주요 도시까지의 거리를 표시해주는 점도 마음에 들었다. 나는 많은 관광객들이 '집'을 찾는 것을 볼 수 있고 나도 그랬다. 따라서 서울에 계시다면 N 서울 타워를 확인하십시오. 식사와 테디베어 뮤지엄, 던진 현장을 산책하며 여유롭게 방문한다면 적어도 반나절은 충분하다. 주요 웹사이트에서 액세스 정보 및 시간을 확인하고 야경이 멋지다고 들었습니다. 확실히 제가 추천하는 사이트입니다."

The top of the tower is a bit so-so. It's not that significantly higher imo. You don't get to feel the height either as there are no glass floors for you to look down.

Since I came from USA and it was daytime (no lights), the tower itself did not amaze me. The teddy bear museum was fun for my 4yr old girl although there wasn't much activity to amuse me. The Korean culture as seen on the tower interested me. They have trees with padlocks and padlocks on the perimeters of the tower. What we enjoyed the most was when we were about to leave the area, there was a traditional costume wearing free of charge and my husband went for it.

461,461,461,5250,"You have to be extremely determined to get to the top of this tower. There’s no quick and easy way. A city tour bus stops here – the hop on hop off type. Local buses venture up, and my guide book says that taxis carrying foreign tourists can drive up. There’s also a cable car but that’s no quick and easy trip either. The base of the cable car has no nearby metro and it’s a climb just to get there. On my way down I did see some shuttle buses but as a tourist, good look with finding out where they go to. There’s a rail car which covers part of the way from the base station to the street level.  Anyway, back to the tower. When you get off your bus, you’re still faced with a steep climb to the tower. Fatties beware. You buy your ticket then you look round for signs where to go and see none, so naturally you head to the base of the tower and inside you do a complete circuit past numerous cafes etc and see a lift. Then you’re told that this is not the lift up. The man points to a public phone across a pathway outside and a small alleyway behind it. You look for the signs and still see none. Not any in English anyway. The pathway leads you in to a building with various entertainments and you still find yourself looking around and having to ask where the lift is. Eventually, at some point in your life, you get to the top of the tower.  The view is ok. During my 9 day stay I went up on what was probably the clearest sunniest day and it was still very hazy. There were no distant views to be enjoyed. As always, I venture up these towers mid to late afternoon for daytime photos and stay until after dark for night shots. Seoul didn’t really come to life and light up very much. Not like say Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai and Sydney. It was disappointing. From a photographic point of view, the cleanliness of the windows was good.  Now the descent. I chose to use the cable car. By the time you’ve walked down the multitude of steps to discover the huge queue, you’re unlikely to feel like climbing all the way back up to get a bus down. So you join the queue and during that time you’re expecting to come across a ticket booth, or pay on entry thing. Not quite. By the time you get to a point close to boarding you see that almost everybody has already got a ticket by some means, Your option is to exit the queue and buy a ticket form the vending machine at point of boarding. While you are trying to work out how to use the non-English machine, 50 people who were behind you are now in front and filling up that single slow-moving cable car. If you’re quick and lucky you just manage to get in that car as I did without having to wait 10 minutes for the next one.  At the base station it’s a case of wandering around and deciding on the options. You’re still fairly high up. There are steps down to street level, and as mentioned earlier, a rail car. Some of the non-English speaking tourists found a bay with shuttle buses, went to investigate, then returned to the rail car where I was, having been unable to find out which buses went where. Once you’re back on the street it’s about a 20 minute walk to a metro station. And you’re still going downhill.  So, as I said at the beginning, you have to be extremely determined to venture up this tower.",461,much,"이 탑의 꼭대기에 오르려면 극도로 결단을 내려야 합니다. 빠르고 쉬운 방법은 없습니다. 시티 투어 버스는 여기에서 정차합니다 – 홉 온 홉 오프 타입. 시내버스가 올라가는데 제 가이드북에는 외국인 관광객을 태운 택시가 올라올 수 있다고 나와 있습니다. 케이블카도 있지만 빠르고 쉬운 여행은 아닙니다. 케이블카의 기슭에는 근처에 지하철이 없으며 거기에 도착하기 위해 오르막입니다. 내려가는 길에 셔틀버스를 몇 대 보았지만 관광객으로서 그들이 어디로 가는지 알아가는 것이 좋습니다. 베이스 스테이션에서 거리 수준까지의 일부를 커버하는 철도 차량이 있습니다. 어쨌든 타워로 돌아갑니다. 버스에서 내리면 여전히 가파른 탑을 올라야 합니다. 지방이 조심하십시오. 티켓을 구입한 다음 어디로 가야 하는지 이정표를 찾아보고 아무 것도 볼 수 없습니다. 그래서 자연스럽게 타워 바닥으로 향하고 내부에서 수많은 카페 등을 지나 완전한 순환을 하고 리프트를 봅니다. 그런 다음 이것은 리프트 업이 아니라고 말합니다. 남자는 밖 통로와 그 뒤에 있는 작은 골목을 가로질러 공중전화를 가리켰다. 당신은 징후를 찾고 여전히 아무것도 볼 수 없습니다. 어쨌든 영어에는 없습니다. 통로는 다양한 엔터테인먼트가 있는 건물로 안내하며 여전히 주위를 둘러보고 엘리베이터가 어디에 있는지 물어야 합니다. 결국, 인생의 어느 시점에서, 당신은 탑의 꼭대기에 도착합니다. 보기는 괜찮습니다. 9일 동안 머무르는 동안 나는 아마도 가장 맑은 날에 올라갔지만 여전히 매우 흐릿했습니다. 즐길 거리가 멀었다. 늘 그렇듯이 저는 낮 사진을 찍기 위해 오후 중반에서 늦은 오후까지 이 타워에 올라가서 밤 사진을 찍기 위해 어두워질 때까지 머물렀습니다. 서울은 실제로 살아나지 않았고 많이 밝아지지 않았습니다. 홍콩, 도쿄, 상하이, 시드니와는 다릅니다. 실망스러웠다. 사진상으로 봤을때 창가의 청결도는 좋았습니다. 이제 내리막길. 나는 케이블카를 이용하기로 했다. 거대한 대기열을 발견하기 위해 수많은 계단을 걸어 내려갈 때쯤이면 버스를 내리기 위해 다시 끝까지 올라가고 싶은 기분이 들지 않을 것입니다. 그래서 당신은 대기열에 합류하고 그 시간 동안 매표소를 찾거나 입장료를 지불할 것으로 예상합니다. 좀 빠지는. 탑승에 가까운 지점에 도착할 때쯤이면 거의 모든 사람들이 어떤 방식으로든 이미 티켓을 얻었음을 알 수 있습니다. 당신의 선택은 대기열에서 나와 탑승 지점의 자동 판매기에서 티켓을 구매하는 것입니다. 당신이 비영어권 기계를 어떻게 사용할지 고민하는 동안, 당신 뒤에 있던 50명의 사람들이 이제 앞에 서서 천천히 움직이는 그 한 대의 케이블카를 채우고 있습니다. 당신이 빠르고 운이 좋다면 당신은 다음 차를 위해 10분을 기다릴 필요 없이 저처럼 그 차에 탈 수 있습니다. 기지국에서는 이리저리 방황하고 옵션을 결정하는 경우입니다. 당신은 여전히 ​​​​높은 위치에 있습니다. 거리 수준으로 내려가는 계단이 있으며 앞서 언급했듯이 철도 차량이 있습니다. 비영어권 관광객 중 일부는 셔틀 버스가 있는 만을 발견하고 조사를 하러 갔다가, 어느 버스가 어디로 갔는지 찾지 못한 채 내가 있는 철도 차량으로 돌아왔습니다. 거리로 돌아오면 지하철역까지 도보로 약 20분이 소요됩니다. 그리고 당신은 여전히 ​​내리막길을 걷고 있습니다. 그래서 처음에 말했듯이 이 탑을 오르기 위해서는 극도로 결단력이 있어야 합니다."

464,464,464,5270,"Missed this attraction fm my last trip so was very determined to go this round. We were misinformed at the concierge of our hotel that this place is walkable from the hotel!! I should have stucked to my own research findings and not trust the reception. Although a short walk, getting to the cable station was a sharp steep walk. Was totally out of breath when we reached the station! The best way to get there is by taxi as it won't cost a lot. It will save you a lot of leg power. If you really want to walk, we found out too late there is a much easier way. I don't have the road names ready but I will try to give adequate directions. From Myeondong shopping are, head towards Migliore dept store and turn right on the main road. Think is is called Namsan-dong. Walk towards Shinsaegae dept store (near Namdaemun market). Before reaching Shinsaegae, turn left (a big road so you can't miss it). Walk on for 5 minutes (uphill) and you will come to a lift (special lift just to bring passengers up to Namsan Cable car station. It is free and is so easy rather than walking uphill like what we did...at the cable car station, a return ticket is KRW8,000 per pax. Need a 10 min wait for each cable car to arrive. It was worth the wait as we got down at the foot of N-Seoul Tower. Plenty of activities as there were some shows going on, changing of guards? Can take pictures with the guards. After a few flight of steps, you will be at the big courtyard where you can buy tickets up to the observatory deck or go into the restaurants in the tower. We wondered around the open areas and were fascinated with the many colourful locks (for sweethearts) and couple seats...you need to see this and try it out...cool. The shops on the ground floor are so pretty and captivating that we forgot all about going up the observatory deck (KRW9,000 entrance fees) and shopped there for nearly 45 minutes, choosing all the cute stuff sold there.

There are some shops, cafes and restaurants near the tower entrance, but I would not recommend. When we went on top, Seoul was all white with snow, which was quite a sight.

You can also get there by bus which would be preferable if you have a problem with heights.  Once the cable car lets you off, up on the mountain, you could walk over to the tower itself or you could explore the mountain, which has a big park and an outdoor pavilion area where they were doing some kind of cultural display when I was there, and who knows what else. There are also food vendors, coffee, and other stuff like that.  So far you could do all this for free, because you can just hike up the mountain if you want, and once there you don't have to pay for anything else unless you want to experience the observation decks or the restaurant in the tower itself. We decided to go ahead and pay to go up to the observation deck, because it doesn't really cost that much and it was a weekday so it wasn't very crowded. We didn't have to wait in line for anything, and we were able to easily take advantage of the bathrooms (which have amazing views and are very clean and nice) and the coffee shop and restaurant and so on that are on the observation levels. One thing we found out is that the restaurant is on a rotating level but the observation level does not rotate, so you can't just sit there and see the entire city like I thought I was going to do.  In summary, the views are amazing and definitely worth it even on a hazy day. Yes it can get a little touristy in there, and yes the prices at the coffee shop and so on are quite high, but it is a tourist attraction after all.

I took the bus both times, so I suppose I would try walking the foot path or cable car if i ever went again. The bus was fine. I recommend going in the late after noon when you can see the view of the city by day. You can then stay and enjoy a snack in the cafe and watch the sunset. You will be treated to an entirely different scene when you see the city light up for the evening. Go with someone who isn't in a rush, and who will appreciate the scenery with you. This is definitely worth doing once if you are in Korea for a year or more. Please be aware that there is an additional cost to go up to the viewing levels of the tower. Some friends had paid to take the cable car up to the tower grounds, but they then realized they had to by the additional cost to take the elevator up inside the tower. In my opinion, if you go all the way there, you have to go up inside the tower. The cost, whatever it was, did not seem much to me and was worth it. The lineups were not bad when I was there either, the staff was friendly, and the bathrooms were clean.

(Note no plural) thats right for a technological advance country that is hugely populated with both citizens and tourist the cable cart ride only has 1 (ONE) cable cart to take you up to the tower and another one back down it. The posters or pictures of the cable cart is so misleading. Theres only a total of 2 cable carts for a group of 20-25 sardines opps i mean people swashed in. Seriously what was Korea thinking when they designed it. So we queued to purchase tickets and then queued again for the cable cart. Once when we finally reached to the top it was 9pm. Thats right 9pm a whole 2 hours of queueing. Then we bloody had to queue again to purchase tickets to go up the tower which took another half an hour. We got our tickets at 9:30pm and was told that all the resturants were closed so no food was available. There goes our dinner. We had to eat in a cafe (A Twosome place cafe) muffins and scones. Not what we wanted especially since we wanted to eat at the dinner at the Ngrill. All other food shops were closing and only drinks were available. So we only purchased the observatory deck tickets which AGAIN we had to wait 50min to get on the elvator and up the tower. So just over 10 pm we were up the tower for only 20-30 min and only to queue again to go back down onto the cable cart. then we caught a taxi to take us back to our hotel for room service dinner at 12pm.

I remember 3 years ago it was a relaxing walk up and down and also the tower area was quite peaceful. Somehow I have the feeling it is worsening year by year. The operator has started to renovate and offer now several floors with shops, restaurants and whatsoever. Some of them opened and just closed again. LOL. Why? Because probably not many people will spend a penny there. There are mainly interested in making selfies. That's it. And who shall buy all these things you really don't need? We went there and left every time at least 50k for tower entrance and a beer, coffee or ice cream. There were a few shops totally enough to serve visitors. And usually you climb up to have a nice few and not to drink and eat whole day long. Anyway this time is over for us spending any coin there. This year every time we visited the place it was totally over crowded. If you want to visit tower's upper floor you shall wait at least an hour or even more. Especially on the weekends. Same way down. I can be wrong but since 2015 it changed dramatically. We usually walking either up or down along the small road. I remember the time when we saw many people using the bike to go up. Time is over. Now every minute some old diesel engine is rushing uphill to unload and to come back to collect again. Some of them are driving fast and reckless. If you have kids you are mainly busy with watching them because you are afraid that something happened. I really wonder why Seoul citizens are not doing much about it. Did they gave up already? Do they like how it is? This place becomes really disgusting. It has nothing to do anymore with a nice, beautiful, quiet, green, park and place. It just became a polluted place of commerce.

From there, it was an uphill walk towards the tower. Up at the plaza area, we could still enjoy some good views of the city below us. The weather wasn't perfect, but we still went up to the Seoul Tower for a higher view. We took the elevator up and were taken by surprise with the motion-graphics display inside the lift. It made us feel like astronauts traveling in a space shuttle into the galaxy. At the observatory, we were disappointed with the 360⁰ view due to the fog. The view up there in an enclosed observatory was actually worst than the open view down below at the plaza. The only worthwhile thing to mention about the observatory is the restroom.

I guess it was exactly as described but the atmosphere was empty and there's just not much excitement to have when you can really only do the pose they show you, nothing unique about your experience.

So maybe check that out instead.

589,589,66,4839,"Yes, this is a definite ""tourist site""; but those who enjoy going off the beaten path, don't let that deter you from enjoying the absolutely breathtaking and first-class views that can be enjoyed at the tower! Also, take note: whether it's called ""North Seoul Tower"", ""Seoul Tower"", or ""Namsan Tower"", it's all the same place!  My husband and I took a subway to Myeong-Dong; then, we walked (mind you, it's ALL uphill, so strollers, crutches, and wheelchairs will be a challenge! and once you get TO the mountain, they will be impossible, sadly) to the sky-lift that takes you (in groups of about 20 or so) to the middle of the mountain below the tower. Be sure to purchase the round-trip tickets for the sky-lift; or else you will be forced to walk alllllll the way down the massive staircase from the top to get back down.  (Sidenote: this is considered a very romantic, ""couples"" location; so, my husband and I were able to get a couples' ticket deal on the sky-lift. If you're in pairs of two, this is the way to go, because it saved some cash for sure.)  Once you arrive on the mountain, you will need to take the rest of the stairs to the top of the mountain where the tower sits. There are a LOT of stairs! Children will probably tire and need to be carried. The good news is that there are several platform areas with food and refreshments available for purchase. We saw beer, water, soda, juices, and all sorts of snack foods being offered to weary wanderers as they trek up the stairs to the top.  There are several areas all around the tower where you can take the most spectacular pictures and enjoy the amazing view of the city. It's 360 degrees all the way around; so, you can get nearly any angle of Seoul you wish. If you get vertigo, beware! Lots of opportunity to get dizzy. :-( But, it's truly worth it. I really believe you will not find better views of the city than right here at N. Seoul Tower. Also, it's worth noting that we went during the afternoon; but we've heard it's absolutely incredible at night with all the lights in the city sparkling around you.  If you're with your sweetheart bring a lock with your names and a special date on it to ""lock in love"" on the tower railing. There is a similar place like this in Paris (a love bridge), but I think the view here at Namsan far outweighs the bridge in Paris. Forgot a lock? No worries, they're sold right there on site (mind you, they are a lot more expensive at the tower!)!  There are several ""love benches"" (shaped in a ""V"" that forces the two sitting upon it to squeeze in close together), ""love lock trees"" (yes, trees made entirely of love locks), and other ""love"" related things that make for great photo ops.  There's a restaurant at the top of the tower, one at the bottom, and several, little shops and snack shops surrounding the tower too. We did not eat there, but everything smelled delicious!  We really lucked out the afternoon that we visited, because they were putting on a traditional, Korean martial arts display on the big open area near the tower. It was a FABULOUS performance, and afterwards they allowed the viewers to come down and touch and hold the weapons and such.  I cannot imagine traveling to Seoul (especially for the first time) without a visit to N. Seoul Tower! There's a reason all the tourists go there - it's incredible and there is absolutely NO better way to view Seoul in all it's splendor than from the vistas of the tower itself.

You can also get there by bus which would be preferable if you have a problem with heights.  Once the cable car lets you off, up on the mountain, you could walk over to the tower itself or you could explore the mountain, which has a big park and an outdoor pavilion area where they were doing some kind of cultural display when I was there, and who knows what else. There are also food vendors, coffee, and other stuff like that.  So far you could do all this for free, because you can just hike up the mountain if you want, and once there you don't have to pay for anything else unless you want to experience the observation decks or the restaurant in the tower itself. We decided to go ahead and pay to go up to the observation deck, because it doesn't really cost that much and it was a weekday so it wasn't very crowded. We didn't have to wait in line for anything, and we were able to easily take advantage of the bathrooms (which have amazing views and are very clean and nice) and the coffee shop and restaurant and so on that are on the observation levels. One thing we found out is that the restaurant is on a rotating level but the observation level does not rotate, so you can't just sit there and see the entire city like I thought I was going to do.  In summary, the views are amazing and definitely worth it even on a hazy day. Yes it can get a little touristy in there, and yes the prices at the coffee shop and so on are quite high, but it is a tourist attraction after all. I considered it to be worth the price of admission. I plan on going back on a clear day if possible to eat at the rotating restaurant just so I can enjoy the view of the whole city.",597,else,"서울 타워에 도착하는 것은 그 자체로 일종의 모험입니다. 지하철 정류장을 타고 상업 지구를 지나 레스토랑과 물건을 지나 계단을 타고 거리를 따라 케이블카까지 걸어가는 온라인 지침을 따르는 데 문제가 없었습니다. 그 자체로 흥미로운 여행이었습니다. 높이에 문제가있는 경우 선호되는 버스로도 갈 수 있습니다. 케이블카를 타고 산 위로 올라가면 타워 자체로 걸어갈 수도 있고, 내가 어렸을 때 일종의 문화 전시를 하던 야외 정자와 큰 공원이 있는 산을 탐험할 수도 있습니다. 거기, 그리고 누가 또 무엇을 알고 있습니다. 식품 판매 업체, 커피 및 기타 유사한 것들도 있습니다. 지금까지는 이 모든 것을 무료로 할 수 있었습니다. 원하는 경우 산에 오르기만 하면 됩니다. 전망대에 오르거나 타워 자체에서 레스토랑을 경험하고 싶지 않다면 다른 비용을 지불할 필요가 없기 때문입니다. . 우리는 전망대에 가기 위해 돈을 지불하기로 결정했습니다. 비용이 그렇게 많이 들지 않고 평일이라 사람이 많이 붐비지 않았기 때문입니다. 우리는 줄을 서서 기다릴 필요가 없었고 전망이 훌륭하고 매우 깨끗하고 멋진 욕실과 전망대에 있는 커피숍, 레스토랑 등을 쉽게 이용할 수 있었습니다. . 우리가 알게 된 한 가지는 레스토랑이 회전하는 수준이지만 관찰 수준은 회전하지 않기 때문에 내가 할 것이라고 생각한 것처럼 거기에 앉아서 전체 도시를 볼 수 없다는 것입니다. 요약하면, 전망은 놀랍고 흐린 날에도 확실히 가치가 있습니다. 예, 거기에 약간의 touristy를 얻을 수 있습니다. 예, 커피 숍 등의 가격은 상당히 높지만 결국 관광 명소입니다. 입장료의 가치가 있다고 생각했습니다. 나는 가능하면 맑은 날에 돌아가서 도시 전체의 경치를 즐길 수 있도록 회전 레스토랑에서 식사를 할 계획입니다."
598,598,0,358,On our last day in Seoul we decided it was now or never. So we headed to the cable car station to catch it up to the tower. I was quite disappointed as they packed us in there was no room. The lady next to me started to shove me out of her way just so she could see out the window like she was more important I think not. I thought this was very rude we are all there on a holiday to enjoy it why treat other people like this I really don’t see the point.  We got to the bottom of the tower we seen all the colourful padlocks they were very interesting to some photos but made the choice not to go up as visibility was rather poor. This ended up being the right choice because when we came back down. We found a nice Korean BBQ place for lunch. By the time we came out of there it was raining and you could hardly see the tower.  It was a real shame the weather wasn’t with us on this day but some things can’t be helped.,598,disappointed,서울에서의 마지막 날에 우리는 지금 아니면 안 된다고 결정했습니다. 그래서 우리는 타워까지 그것을 따라붙기 위해 케이블카 역으로 향했다. 그들이 우리를 포장 할 방이 없었기 때문에 나는 매우 실망했습니다. 내 옆에 있던 아주머니는 내가 생각하기에 자신이 더 중요한 사람인 것처럼 창밖을 볼 수 있도록 나를 밀어내기 시작했습니다. 나는 이것이 매우 무례하다고 생각했습니다. 우리 모두가 휴가를 즐기기 위해 왜 다른 사람들을 이렇게 대하는지 나는 정말로 요점을 이해하지 못합니다. 우리는 타워의 바닥에 도착했습니다. 우리는 모든 다채로운 자물쇠가 일부 사진에 매우 흥미로웠지만 가시성이 좋지 않았기 때문에 올라가지 않기로 결정했습니다. 이것은 우리가 다시 내려왔을 때 올바른 선택이었습니다. 우리는 점심에 좋은 한국식 바베큐 장소를 찾았습니다. 우리가 거기에서 나왔을 때 비가 와서 타워를 거의 볼 수 없었습니다. 이날 날씨가 우리와 함께하지 않아 정말 아쉬웠지만 어쩔 수 없는 부분도 있었다.
599,599,1,361,"If you are planning to go to the observatory, mind the weather conditions as they do not have any notice about the visibility. They did not offer to give a refund or to make it valid for another day. Very disappointed",599,disappointed,전망대에 가실 계획이라면 날씨가 시정을 알려주지 않으니 주의하세요. 그들은 환불을 제안하거나 다른 날 동안 유효하게 만들지 않았습니다. 정말 실망했다
600,600,2,393,I have seen this tower so many times in dramas and couldn’t wait to see it in person. I was not disappointed. The fabulous views from the top were amazing. The locks and hearts were just as I imagined. I’m so happy I got to experience this.,600,disappointed,나는 이 탑을 드라마에서 많이 보았고 직접 볼 수 있기를 고대하고 있습니다. 나는 실망하지 않았다. 정상에서의 멋진 전망은 훌륭했습니다. 자물쇠와 하트는 내가 상상했던 그대로였다. 이런 경험을 하게 되어 너무 기쁩니다.
601,601,3,505,"To be honest, I found this tower to be way too touristy. We went there in the evening to enjoy the lights of Seoul, but we were kind of disappointed. You have to wait in line for quite a while to take the elevators to the observation deck of the tower and when you eventually get up the reflections of the candy and souvenir shops in the tower spoil the view. You can buy and write postcards that get stamped in the tower itself, but the view is better, when you stay outside on the hill.  Not worth the money.",601,disappointed,"솔직히 말해서, 나는 이 타워가 너무 관광객이 많다는 것을 알았다. 우리는 저녁에 서울의 불빛을 즐기기 위해 거기에 갔지만 우리는 다소 실망했습니다. 엘레베이터를 타고 타워 전망대까지 가려면 꽤 오랜 시간 줄을 서야 하고, 결국 일어나면 타워의 캔디와 기념품 가게에 반사되어 전망을 망친다. 타워 자체에 스탬프가 찍힌 엽서를 사고 쓸 수도 있지만, 바깥 언덕에 있으면 전망이 더 좋습니다. 돈 가치가 없습니다."
602,602,4,594,We made the journey to the tower giving ourselves plenty time but disappointed to find the ticket booth had closed early. We were also ushered away from a viewing deck despite it being quite a bit before the displayed closing time. We did have a bit of a wander about where we could including the love locks so it wasn’t a wasted journey.,602,disappointed,우리는 충분한 시간을 주면서 타워로 여행을 갔지만 매표소가 일찍 문을 닫은 것을 알고 실망했습니다. 우리는 또한 표시되는 폐장 시간보다 훨씬 전에 있음에도 불구하고 전망대에서 안내되었습니다. 우리는 사랑의 자물쇠를 포함할 수 있는 곳에 대해 약간의 방황을 했습니다. 그래서 그것은 낭비된 여행이 아니었습니다.
603,603,5,605,"We visited the N Seoul Tower in April 2019, and were not disappointed. The surrounding was beautiful with cherry blossoms all around it. The view was spectacular, especially at the top of the tower.  We bought the tickets the day before on Trazy.com, and got a 25% discount. It was easy to exchange e-vouchers for tickets at the kiosks at the Tower.  My recommendation is to take the bus (cheaper than cable car), which drop people off near the tower - only a short walk to it. Be prepare to walk uphill a little bit.",603,disappointed,우리는 2019년 4월에 N 서울 타워를 방문했고 실망하지 않았습니다. 주변은 온통 벚꽃으로 아름다웠다. 전망은 특히 타워 꼭대기에서 장관이었습니다. 우리는 전날 Trazy.com에서 티켓을 구입했고 25% 할인을 받았습니다. 타워의 키오스크에서 전자 바우처를 티켓으로 쉽게 교환할 수 있었습니다. 내 추천은 타워 근처에서 사람들을 내려주는 버스(케이블카보다 저렴)를 타는 것입니다. 약간의 오르막길을 걸을 준비를 하십시오.
604,604,6,624,"I came here because I saw how popular it was in the Korean drama. I was a little disappointed because I thought that the outside was the elevator that can go around to the top. Well, when you get inside, it's just an elevator that takes you to the top straight up, not go around like I thought it would be. It was nice, the view up there is beautiful. I went during Fall, so the leaves changing was nice to see. You can also eat and buy a lock to declared your love to each other.",604,disappointed,"한국 드라마에서 얼마나 인기가 좋은지 봤기 때문에 여기에 왔습니다. 외부가 정상까지 돌 수 있는 엘리베이터라고 생각해서 조금 실망했습니다. 글쎄, 당신이 안으로 들어가면, 그것은 당신을 정상으로 곧장 데려다주는 엘리베이터일 뿐이지, 내가 생각했던 것처럼 돌아다니지 않습니다. 그것은 멋졌다, 거기의 보기는 아름다웠다. 가을에 갔더니 단풍이 물드는 모습이 보기 좋았습니다. 당신은 또한 서로에게 당신의 사랑을 선언하기 위해 자물쇠를 먹고 살 수 있습니다."
605,605,7,686,"This was a nice stop. At your leisure you can walk from the bus stop up to the Seoul Tower. My son and I were looking forward to the Cable Car but when we go to the top, we found out it was closed. We were so disappointed....  Anyways ...we just walked around the viewing area and watched a Korean demo and display. We also had lunch in one of the few restaurant they have inside the tower.",605,disappointed,이것은 좋은 중지였습니다. 여가 시간에는 버스 정류장에서 서울 타워까지 걸어갈 수 있습니다. 아들과 나는 케이블카를 고대하고 있었지만 정상에 가보니 문이 닫혀 있었다. 우리는 너무 실망했습니다.... 여하튼 ...우리는 단지 관람 구역을 걸으며 한국의 데모와 전시를 보았습니다. 우리도 타워 내부에 있는 몇 안되는 레스토랑 중 한 곳에서 점심을 먹었습니다.
606,606,8,725,"One of the place that I looked forward so much, but, ended up being so disappointed. It did not appear as charming and nice as my expectation.

607,607,9,904,We visited n tower today The place is magnificent You can reach by two ways ! Either the bus or the cable car We have reached using the cable car which was a bit hard traveling with a toddler and a stroller  To reach the cable car u have to ride a veichel up to cable car Tickets are for both 1 or two ways Adult round trip = 8500 Children under 3 are entering for free  Once you reach the cable car you need to fold your kid’s strolled ! Ride it and then carry it for a very long stairs ! Along with your toddler or baby ! As access for wheel chairs and strollers are not available which is really disappointed  We didn’t actually get into the tower We spent the time around the plaza  Which is consisting of 5 stories I have seen some restaurants with nice view  We were actually looking for the park but not able to reach it as google map services in Korea is so bad and you can not reach using the walking option !,607,disappointed,우리는 오늘 n 타워를 방문했습니다 장소는 웅장합니다 두 가지 방법으로 도달 할 수 있습니다! 버스 또는 케이블카 중 유아와 유모차를 동반하여 이동하기 조금 힘든 케이블카를 이용하여 도착했습니다. 케이블카에 가려면 케이블카까지 베이첼을 타야 합니다. 티켓은 1 또는 2 방법 모두 성인입니다 왕복 = 8500 만 3세 미만 어린이는 무료 입장 가능 케이블카에 도착하면 어린이용 캐리어를 접어야 합니다! 그것을 타고 매우 긴 계단을 운반하십시오! 당신의 유아 또는 아기와 함께! 휠체어와 유모차를 이용할 수 없기 때문에 정말 실망했습니다 우리는 실제로 타워에 들어가지 않았습니다 우리는 5 층으로 구성된 광장에서 시간을 보냈습니다 나는 멋진 전망의 레스토랑을 보았습니다 우리는 실제로 찾고있었습니다 공원이지만 한국의 Google지도 서비스가 너무 나쁘고 도보 옵션을 사용하여 도달 할 수 없기 때문에 도달 할 수 없습니다!
608,608,10,994,"This place was one of the top places that I wanted to visit during my stay in Seoul, and it definitely wasn't a disappointment. As an individual you have the option of taking the bus up the hill or making the hike, but mind you it's a pretty steep and LONG hike. Once at the top there is a fee to go up the tower, but seriously it's only 10 dollars. You should definitely do it! I purchased a lock to put on the famous fence of locks because I'm cheesy like that, but if you're into that kind of stuff it's great for couples. Going to the top of the tower was amazing, but I suggest doing it during the evening to get a few view of Seoul at night, you won't be disappointed.",608,disappointed,"이곳은 서울에 있는 동안 꼭 가보고 싶은 곳 중 하나였으며, 확실히 실망스러운 곳은 아니었습니다. 개인은 버스를 타고 언덕을 오르거나 하이킹을 할 수 있지만 꽤 가파르고 긴 하이킹이라는 점을 염두에 두십시오. 일단 정상에 오르면 요금이 부과되지만, 진지하게는 10달러에 불과합니다. 당신은 확실히 그것을해야합니다! 제가 워낙 촌스러워서 유명한 자물쇠 울타리에 걸려고 자물쇠를 샀는데 그런거 좋아하시는 분들은 커플용으로 좋아요. 타워 꼭대기에 올라가는 것은 훌륭했지만 밤에 서울의 전경을 조금 보기 위해 저녁에 하는 것이 좋습니다. 실망하지 않을 것입니다."
609,609,11,1194,"Super easy to get there and back with incredible views. Several options including hiking great trails up, city bus or cable car. Going up to the base of the tower is free, going up to the top is around $10 or so.

610,610,12,1273,"We visited Seoul Tower on the day of ""chuseok"" (major harvest festival) 2015. We did not plan but the day was 27th September, the supermoon night. We reached there by bus from Chungmuro station in Seoul. The bus was over crowded. We could even spot foreigners like us and couples wearing traditional hanbok (Korean dress). We reached and saw a big crowd moving up towards the Seoul Tower. (It reminded me of Durga Puja crowd in my hometown Kolkata). I was a bit disappointed. Then we reached the tower by walking the steep slope. ( I always want to visit again by the cable car or by hiking through the gently rolling slopes or the steps up to the Namsan Tower). There was a long queue in front of the ticket counter. Anyway we took a ticket for the Alive Museum and the tower observatory. As soon as we entered the Alive museum our mood changed totally. The Alive museum might look childish to most of us in the beginning (I also had a preconceived thought). But I bet everyone will enjoy this museum. The beautiful and amazing 3D sculptures created by contemporary artists are a wonderful experience as a whole. We spent quite a good amount of time posing and photographing each other in front of the sculptures. After that we reached the observatory. It was almost the time of sunset. We could almost see the entire city. It looked amazing. We stayed there for about one and half hours and enjoyed the scenes outside. The city of Seoul at night with supermoon was a lifetime experience for us. The traffic on the both sides of Han river looks like glittering golden ribbon. It’s worth visiting Seoul tower at night. But I will try to visit Seoul Tower in a weekday when there will be a little less crowd.",610,disappointed,2015년 추석 당일 서울타워를 방문했습니다. 계획은 없었지만 그날은 슈퍼문 밤인 9월 27일이었습니다. 서울 충무로역에서 버스를 타고 도착했습니다. 버스는 붐볐다. 우리 같은 외국인과 전통 한복을 입은 커플도 볼 수 있었습니다. 우리는 서울 타워를 향해 올라가고 있는 큰 군중을 보았다. (그것은 나에게 나의 고향 콜카타의 Durga Puja 군중을 생각나게 했다). 나는 약간 실망했다. 그 다음 우리는 가파른 비탈을 걸어 타워에 도달했습니다. (언제나 케이블카를 타거나 완만하게 구불구불한 비탈길을 하이킹하거나 남산타워로 올라가는 계단을 통해 다시 방문하고 싶습니다.) 매표소 앞에 줄이 길게 늘어서 있었다. 여하튼 우리는 박물관은 살아있다와 타워 전망대 입장권을 샀다. Alive 박물관에 들어서자마자 우리의 기분은 완전히 바뀌었습니다. 살아 있는 박물관은 처음에 우리 대부분에게 유치해 보일 수 있습니다(저도 선입견이 있었습니다). 그러나 나는 모두가 이 박물관을 즐길 것이라고 장담합니다. 현대 예술가들이 만든 아름답고 놀라운 3D 조각은 전체적으로 멋진 경험입니다. 우리는 조각품 앞에서 서로 포즈를 취하고 사진을 찍으며 꽤 많은 시간을 보냈습니다. 그 후 우리는 전망대에 도착했습니다. 거의 해가 질 무렵이었다. 우리는 거의 도시 전체를 볼 수 있었습니다. 그것은 훌륭해 보였다. 우리는 약 1시간 30분 동안 그곳에 머물면서 바깥 풍경을 즐겼습니다. 슈퍼문이 있는 서울의 밤은 우리에게 일생일대의 경험이었습니다. 한강 양쪽의 교통은 반짝이는 황금 리본처럼 보입니다. 밤에 서울 타워를 방문할 가치가 있습니다. 하지만 조금 덜 붐비는 평일에 서울타워에 가보려고 합니다.
611,611,13,1285,"Apparently, you can trek to the tower from the centre of town, but I did it as part of the Seoul City Bus Tour. Show your bus ticket and receive a 10% discount on your ticket to the top of the tower.  There are a couple of restaurants, but I didn't try any of them. I went for the views and as it was a clear day, I was not disappointed. 360 degree views of Seoul were amazing.",611,disappointed,분명히 시내 중심에서 타워까지 트레킹 할 수 있지만 서울 시티 버스 투어의 일환으로했습니다. 버스 티켓을 제시하고 타워 꼭대기까지의 티켓을 10% 할인 받으세요. 식당이 몇 군데 있긴 한데 하나도 안 먹어봤어요. 나는 경치를 보러 갔고 맑은 날이어서 실망하지 않았습니다. 서울의 360도 전망은 훌륭했습니다.

613,613,15,1458,Easy to find following direction on the Tower website. 5 mins walk uphill from Pacific Hotel to the Cable Car. EXTREMELY long queue to board the cable car - 45 mins from ticket purchase to boarding platform. Got off cable car more walking up the hill to ticket office. Another queue to buy tickets at Ticket Office for Hancook Package - Korean Buffet and Observation Deck entry (on display above ticket windows). Was told has to go downstairs to buy tickets. More walking to a different Ticket Office which is fine by me. Waited in queue again to purchase the Package. Then another queue for the elevator to go up the tower. Hancook Restaurant doesnt revolve so a bit disappointed but still offers great views. Finished dinner and waited in LONG queue to take the elevator down (about 15 mins). Then another queue to board the cable car to go back. Good experience overall so worth the wait. But wont be back.,613,disappointed,타워 웹 사이트에서 다음 방향을 쉽게 찾을 수 있습니다. 퍼시픽 호텔에서 케이블카까지 오르막 도보 5분. 케이블카 탑승을 위한 매우 긴 대기열 - 티켓 구매에서 탑승 플랫폼까지 45분. 케이블카에서 내려 매표소까지 언덕을 더 걸어갔습니다. 한쿡패키지 매표소에서 티켓을 구매하기 위한 또 다른 대기열 - 한식 뷔페 및 전망대 입장(매표 창구 위에 표시됨). 표를 사려면 아래층으로 내려가야 한다고 합니다. 나에 의해 괜찮은 다른 매표소로 더 많이 걷는다. 패키지를 구매하기 위해 다시 대기열에서 기다렸습니다. 그런 다음 엘리베이터가 타워를 올라가기 위해 또 다른 대기열. Hancook 레스토랑은 회전하지 않아 약간 실망했지만 여전히 멋진 전망을 제공합니다. 저녁 식사를 마치고 엘리베이터를 내리기 위해 긴 대기열에서 기다렸습니다(약 15분). 그런 다음 돌아가기 위해 케이블카를 타기 위해 또 다른 대기열. 전반적으로 좋은 경험이므로 기다릴 가치가 있습니다. 그러나 돌아 오지 않을 것입니다.
614,614,16,1468,"a bit disappointed as it was raining and drizzling when we went hence decided to just walk around the area and not heading up to the observation deck itself.

We checked into the Pacific Hotel and walked to the Tram entrance, a short hike directly behind our hotel. The tickets were $9 each for the tram ride up and once at the base of the tower, we purchased a ticket to the observation deck of the tower. Another $9 each. The tram ride offers a great view, though I was disappointed that it wasn't air conditioned. In case you haven't heard, summer and winter weather in Seoul is extreme! The park at the base of the tower is very nice with lots of areas to sit and enjoy the view, restaurants, a bar and shopping areas. The elevator ride to the top of the Tower is quick with a fun video to keep your mind off the quickness of the ride. The observation deck has a restaurant, a bar, a candy shop and plenty of shopping. It even offers a post office with lots of fun stationary for purchase. The lines to get up/down to the park and tower are long, though it is very organized. I would suggest adding another drink machine in the staging area to the tram. There is one right before you get to the stairs. It would have been nice to have a machine as you walk into this room.",621,disappointed,"우리는 쇼핑을 하러 갔지만 서울은 이번이 처음이었기 때문에 구경을 조금 하기로 했습니다. 우리는 Pacific Hotel에 체크인하고 호텔 바로 뒤에서 짧은 하이킹을 하는 트램 입구까지 걸어갔습니다. 표는 트램을 탈 때 각각 9달러였고, 일단 타워 기슭에서 우리는 타워 전망대 티켓을 구입했습니다. 개당 9달러 더. 트램을 타는 것은 멋진 전망을 제공하지만 에어컨이 없어서 실망했습니다. 혹시 모르니 서울의 여름과 겨울 날씨는 혹독합니다! 타워 기슭에 있는 공원은 앉아서 전망, 레스토랑, 바, 쇼핑 지역을 즐길 수 있는 많은 공간이 있어 매우 좋습니다. 엘리베이터를 타고 타워 꼭대기까지 올라가는 과정은 재미있는 비디오와 함께 빠르게 진행되어 탑승의 속도에서 정신을 잃을 수 있습니다. 전망대에는 레스토랑, 바, 사탕 가게 및 다양한 상점이 있습니다. 심지어 재미있는 문구류를 구입할 수 있는 우체국도 제공합니다. 공원과 타워를 오르내리는 줄이 매우 길지만 매우 체계적입니다. 트램에 대기 장소에 다른 음료 기계를 추가하는 것이 좋습니다. 계단을 오르기 직전에 하나 있습니다. 이 방에 들어갈 때 기계가 있으면 좋았을 것입니다."
622,622,24,2224,"There is only one reason to go to the Nansam Seoul Tower - to get a grand view of Seoul. It is worth going up just for that reason. The 360-degree restaurant view is also spectacular, especially at night. Just don't expect the food to be more than average, and don't be shocked by the high prices - just remember, you are there for the view. If you are there for anything else, you will be disappointed. NOTE: Don't go up when the air quality is bad - you won't see much.",622,disappointed,"남산서울타워에 가는 이유는 단 하나, 서울의 웅대한 경치를 보기 위해서다. 그 이유만으로도 올라갈 가치가 있습니다. 특히 밤에는 360도 레스토랑 뷰가 장관입니다. 음식이 평균 이상일 것이라고 기대하지 말고 높은 가격에 충격을 받지 마십시오. 단지 당신이 그곳에 있다는 것을 기억하십시오. 당신이 다른 것을 위해 거기에 있다면, 당신은 실망할 것입니다. 참고: 공기 질이 나쁠 때 올라가지 마십시오. 많이 볼 수 없습니다."
623,623,25,2277,"We were in town for only one night so one of the sights we wanted to see was the Seoul Tower and we were not disappointed. We're from NYC and this definitely reminded us the Empire State Building in many ways. It also featured a great burger joint, excellent vantage points of the temple and the space needle is simply exquisite.",623,disappointed,"우리는 단지 하룻밤 동안 도시에 있었기 때문에 우리가보고 싶었던 명소 중 하나가 서울 타워였으며 실망하지 않았습니다. 우리는 NYC에서 왔으며 이것은 여러 면에서 엠파이어 스테이트 빌딩을 확실히 상기시켰습니다. 그것은 또한 훌륭한 버거 조인트, 사원의 우수한 유리한 지점 및 공간 바늘이 단순히 절묘한 것을 특징으로했습니다."
624,624,26,2499,"We walked up the hill to Seoul tower, which we would really recommend. The walk was lovely and we stopped for the view all the way up :)  When we got to the top we thought we may as well visit the tower for an even higher view, and we weren’t disappointed. We managed to get a deal for two people, two drinks and a massive popcorn for virtually the same price as two standard tickets, which was a win. We loved going up in the lift to the top - no queue when we were there and the video was great.  We watched the sunset from the top so got the day / sunset / night view. We have visited a lot of similar towers and viewing points from around the world and we did really enjoy this one. Good value to money and a great walk if you start from the very bottom.",624,disappointed,"우리는 언덕을 올라 서울 타워까지 걸어갔습니다. 정말 추천하고 싶습니다. 산책은 사랑스럽고 우리는 끝까지 전망을 위해 멈췄습니다 :) 정상에 도착했을 때 우리는 더 높은 전망을 위해 타워를 방문하는 것이 좋겠다고 생각했고 실망하지 않았습니다. 우리는 그럭저럭 2명의 표준 티켓과 거의 같은 가격에 2명의 사람, 2개의 음료 및 방대한 팝콘을 위한 거래를 얻을 수 있었고, 그것은 승리였습니다. 우리는 꼭대기까지 엘리베이터를 타는 것을 좋아했습니다. 우리가 거기에 있었을 때 대기열이 없었고 비디오가 훌륭했습니다. 우리는 정상에서 일몰을 보았으므로 낮 / 일몰 / 야경을 얻었습니다. 우리는 전 세계에서 비슷한 타워와 전망대를 많이 방문했으며 이것을 정말 즐겼습니다. 맨 밑바닥부터 시작하면 가성비가 좋고 산책하기 좋습니다."
625,625,27,2719,I suggest taking the hike up the mountain. The sky cars we were packed like sardines. We couldn't even move or see anything on the way up or down. All I could think was this can't be safe. So save your money and enjoy the sites. The tower itself has lovely views but make sure it's a clear day or you will be disappointed. It is a rather large tourist attraction so don't be surprised by the amount of people and clutter. It is a nice place to be stopping by and a pretty view to see but there are better sites in Seoul that are way more worth your time.,625,disappointed,나는 산에 하이킹을 할 것을 제안합니다. 우리는 정어리처럼 포장 된 스카이 카. 올라가거나 내려가는 길에 우리는 움직이거나 아무것도 볼 수 없었습니다. 안전할 수 없다는 생각뿐이었습니다. 따라서 돈을 절약하고 사이트를 즐기십시오. 타워 자체는 아름다운 전망을 가지고 있지만 맑은 날인지 확인하십시오. 그렇지 않으면 실망하게 될 것입니다. 그것은 다소 큰 관광 명소이므로 사람의 수와 어수선함에 놀라지 마십시오. 들르기에 좋은 곳이고 보기에도 좋은 곳이지만 서울에는 시간을 할애할 가치가 있는 더 좋은 곳이 있습니다.
626,626,28,2919,"Being regular visitors to Seoul, we figured we should go and see N Seoul Tower eventually and were not disappointed. The tower features beautiful views of the city and is a great starting point for a walk in Namsan Park. Having said that, it would not make it onto my bucket list for a first visit.",626,disappointed,서울에 정기적으로 방문하는 우리는 결국 N 서울 타워를 보러 가야한다고 생각했고 실망하지 않았습니다. 타워는 도시의 아름다운 전망을 제공하며 남산 공원에서 산책을 위한 좋은 출발점입니다. 그렇게 말하면 첫 방문의 버킷리스트에 포함되지 않을 것입니다.
627,627,29,2946,"This tower offers a nice view on the whole city but well; there isn't much to see. To be honest, the city doesn't look exceptional from the observation floor... A bit disappointed. But the night view is nice! Small tip: if you bought the t-money card (for transportation in Seoul), you have a small -10% coupon to the price of your entrence ticket in the small box. ~",627,disappointed,이 타워는 도시 전체의 멋진 전망을 제공하지만 좋습니다. 별로 볼 것이 없습니다. 솔직히 전망대에서 본 도시는 별반 다르지 않은데.. 조금 실망.. 하지만 야경은 굿! 작은 팁: 티머니 카드(서울 교통)를 구입하면 작은 상자에 입장권 가격의 작은 -10% 쿠폰이 있습니다. ~
628,628,30,2959,We went during quite cold weather so it was a bit difficult until we got up the viewing floor. I was particularly disappointed that the windows weren't very clear so I didn't get good photos. Just on a side note: if you go to the women's and probably men's toilet too there is a breath taking view inside the actual cubicles!! So that's an enjoyable moment to take in while you do your business!!,628,disappointed,우리는 꽤 추운 날씨에 갔기 때문에 전망대에 올라갈 때까지 조금 힘들었습니다. 특히 창문이 너무 맑지 않아 좋은 사진을 찍지 못해서 아쉬웠습니다. 참고로 여자화장실과 남자화장실에 가면 실제 칸막이 안을 숨막히게 볼 수 있습니다!! 그래서 비즈니스를 하는 동안 즐거운 시간을 보낼 수 있습니다!!
629,629,31,3148,The tower was ok. Nice views. But I was disappointed in package I bought. Two beers -popcorn-ride up for two. Sounds like the top would be a nice place to have a beer. Wrong--- you carry the beers and popcorn up the elevator-- stand in crowd drinking the beers.,629,disappointed,타워는 괜찮 았어. 멋진 전망. 그러나 나는 내가 산 패키지에 실망했다. 맥주 2잔 - 팝콘 - 2인용. 맥주 한 잔 하기 좋은 곳이 정상인 것 같다. 틀렸어--- 맥주와 팝콘을 들고 엘리베이터를 타고-- 맥주를 마시는 군중 속에 서서.
630,630,32,3241,I am a little disappointed with this attraction. Except for the great view of Seoul. There is nothing too impressive compares with Tokyo Sky Tree.,630,disappointed,나는이 매력에 약간 실망했습니다. 서울의 멋진 전망을 제외하고. 도쿄 스카이 트리와 비교할 때 너무 인상적인 것은 없습니다.
631,631,33,3260,Kind of disappointed when I came to this place. The shipping area is almost deserted. Only the upper deck was busy with visitors. Come here only for the view (there are other places you can go to for a better view of the city skyline and it's free) or if you want to have some romantic time with your other half and immortalize your love with a lock on the fence (gag),631,disappointed,이 장소에 왔을 때 약간 실망했습니다. 배송 지역은 거의 황량합니다. 상층부만 방문객들로 붐볐다. 보기를 위해서만 여기로 오십시오(도시 스카이라인을 더 잘 보기 위해 갈 수 있는 다른 장소가 있으며 무료입니다) 또는 다른 반쪽과 낭만적인 시간을 보내고 울타리에 자물쇠로 당신의 사랑을 영원히 간직하고 싶다면 여기로 오십시오. (개그)
632,632,34,3367,Guess it's one of Seoul's must-see places. Was a bit disappointed though. It was overcrowded and there is no outside terrace or something which means you can't really take a nice pic. Bought tickets with popcorn and Heinekens - liked that option.,632,disappointed,서울에서 꼭 가봐야 할 곳 중 하나라고 생각합니다. 조금 실망했지만. 사람이 너무 많았고 외부 테라스가 없거나 멋진 사진을 찍을 수 없다는 것을 의미합니다. 팝콘과 하이네켄으로 티켓을 샀습니다 - 그 옵션이 마음에 들었습니다.
633,633,35,3467,It's quite short and there was nothing much interesting to see inside nor it has a nice view. Quite disappointed.,633,disappointed,꽤 짧고 내부를 볼 수있는 흥미로운 것도 없었고 멋진 전망도 없었습니다. 상당히 실망했습니다.
634,634,36,3815,"We visited N Seoul Tower on a Sunday and it is one of the worst decision ever. Walking up to the cable car is simple and straight forward from Myeong Dong. When we arrived at the cable car terminal, we were informed that the waiting time would be about 40 to 60 mins. There were many Koreans and Tourists waiting to head up to the tower.  The day we were there, visibility was low. We still decided to head up to the observatory deck and was disappointed as we were unable to see the scenary clearly. The deck is also small and packed with people. Not sure if it's worth the money to head up. Neverthless it's definitely one of the to do attractions in Seoul.",634,disappointed,우리는 일요일에 N 서울 타워를 방문했으며 최악의 결정 중 하나입니다. 케이블카까지 걸어가는 길은 명동에서 간단하고 직진합니다. 케이블카 터미널에 도착했을 때 대기시간이 40~60분 정도 걸린다는 안내를 받았습니다. 많은 한국인과 관광객들이 타워로 향하기 위해 기다리고 있었습니다. 우리가 갔던 날은 시야가 좋지 않았다. 그래도 전망대로 올라가기로 했으나 풍경을 제대로 볼 수 없어 아쉬웠다. 갑판도 작고 사람들로 가득 차 있습니다. 돈을 쓸 가치가 있는지 확실하지 않습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 그것은 확실히 서울의 명소 중 하나입니다.
635,635,37,3845,"I've been wanting to come here ever since I first saw that cable car scene from My Lovely Sam Soon and was not disappointed! We planned to arrive during sunset and the hotel I was staying is pretty nearby, so we decided to walk on over. The walk up to the cable car station wasn't bad at all, probably because there is this elevator/ramp hybrid thing that helps you up this last steep portion. The cable cars were really cool to ride in although they do kind of pack you in since there are a lot of people.  Once you get to the top you have to climb a few more flights of stairs, which isn't bad, but may be for those with mobility issues. Once you get close to the top you can start to see all the locks of love. There were quite a few vendors selling locks so those looking to lock their love last minute don't have to worry. The view below the tower is really gorgeous although it was a bit windy when we went. There are quite a few restaurants/shops around the bottom of the tower for those who are hungry from the climb.  The tower costs an additional extra to go up to and we bought the package deal in which popcorn/drinks are included. It's funny how they play this scene that you're blasting off to space as you ascend in the elevator. Once you get to the top of the tower, it's pretty much a 360 degree view of Seoul with souvenir shops in the middle. I like how on each window it tells you how far you are from a major city in the world and it's nice to sit down and chill next to a pretty view .  There's not a wholeee lot to do here besides admiring the scenery, but the entire experience was definitely worth it and fun!",635,disappointed,"내 이름은 삼순이에서 케이블카 장면을 처음 본 이후로 여기오고 싶었고 실망하지 않았습니다! 우리는 일몰 시간에 도착할 예정이었고 내가 머물렀던 호텔이 꽤 가까워서 걸어서 가기로 결정했습니다. 케이블카 역까지의 도보는 전혀 나쁘지 않았습니다. 아마도 이 마지막 가파른 부분을 올라가는 데 도움이 되는 이 엘리베이터/램프 하이브리드가 있기 때문일 것입니다. 케이블카는 사람들이 많기 때문에 일종의 포장을하지만 타기에 정말 시원했습니다. 정상에 오르면 몇 층 더 계단을 올라야 하는데, 나쁘지는 않지만 거동이 불편한 사람들을 위한 것일 수 있습니다. 정상에 가까워지면 사랑의 자물쇠가 모두 보이기 시작할 수 있습니다. 자물쇠를 판매하는 상인이 꽤 많았으므로 마지막 순간에 사랑을 잠그려는 사람들은 걱정할 필요가 없습니다. 우리가 갔을 때 바람이 조금 불었지만 타워 아래의 전망은 정말 화려합니다. 등반에서 배고픈 사람들을 위해 타워 바닥 주위에 꽤 많은 레스토랑/상점이 있습니다. 타워는 올라가는 데 추가 비용이 들며 우리는 팝콘/음료가 포함된 패키지 거래를 샀습니다. 엘리베이터를 타고 올라갈 때 우주로 날아가는 이 장면을 그들이 어떻게 연기하는지 재미있습니다. 타워 꼭대기에 오르면 중간에 기념품 가게가 있는 서울의 거의 360도 전망을 볼 수 있습니다. 나는 각 창에서 당신이 세계의 주요 도시에서 얼마나 멀리 떨어져 있는지 알려주는 방식을 좋아하고 아름다운 전망 옆에 앉아서 차가워지는 것이 좋습니다. 경치를 감상하는 것 외에는 여기에서 할 일이 많지 않지만 전체 경험은 확실히 가치 있고 재미있었습니다!"
636,636,38,3941,"We visited Seoul Tower on the day of ""chuseok"" (major harvest festival) 2015. We did not plan but the day was 27th October (supermoon). We reached there by bus from Chungmuro station. The bus was over crowded. We reached and saw a big croud towards Seoul Tower. ( It remind me of Durga Puja in my hometown Kolkata). I was a bit disappointed. Then we reached the tower by walking. ( I want to visit again by cable car or by hiking through Namsin Tower).  It was a huge queue in front of the ticket counter. anyhow we took a ticket for Alive museum and the tower observatory. We entered the alive museum and our mood changed totally. The alive museum might look childish to most of us (I also thought in the beginning). But I bet everyone will enjoy this museum. After that we reached the observatory.  I was almost the time of sunset. We saw the entire city. It looked amazing. We stayed there for almost one and half hours and enjoyed the scenes outside. The city of Seoul at night with supermoon is a lifetime experience to me. The traffic on the both sides of Han river looks like golden necklace.  Its worth visiting Seoul tower at night. But I will try to visit Seoul Tower in a weekday when there will be a little crowd.",636,disappointed,2015년 추석 당일 서울타워를 방문했습니다. 계획은 없었지만 그날은 10월 27일(슈퍼문)이었습니다. 충무로역에서 버스를 타고 도착했습니다. 버스는 붐볐다. 우리는 서울 타워에 도달했고 큰 군중을 보았습니다. (내 고향 콜카타에 있는 Durga Puja를 생각나게 합니다.) 나는 약간 실망했다. 그리고 걸어서 타워에 도착했다. (케이블카를 타거나 남신타워를 하이킹으로 다시 방문하고 싶습니다.) 매표소 앞에는 엄청난 줄이 있었다. 여하튼 우리는 살아있는 박물관과 타워 전망대 티켓을 샀다. 우리는 살아있는 박물관에 들어갔고 우리의 기분은 완전히 바뀌었습니다. 살아있는 박물관은 우리 대부분에게 유치해 보일 수 있습니다(저도 처음에는 그렇게 생각했습니다). 그러나 나는 모두가 이 박물관을 즐길 것이라고 장담합니다. 그 후 우리는 전망대에 도착했습니다. 나는 거의 일몰 시간이었다. 우리는 도시 전체를 보았다. 그것은 훌륭해 보였다. 우리는 거의 1시간 30분 동안 그곳에 머물면서 바깥 풍경을 즐겼습니다. 슈퍼문이 있는 서울의 밤은 나에게 일생의 경험입니다. 한강 양쪽의 교통체증은 마치 금목걸이처럼 보입니다. 밤에 서울 타워를 방문할 가치가 있습니다. 하지만 사람이 적은 평일에 서울타워에 가보려고 합니다.
637,637,39,4000,"This is the place to go if you want to appreciate how large Seoul is. We took a subway and walked up a steep hill to get to the place where you get on the cable car. I think there's a bus that goes up there, though.  There were many, many people there, and they pack you in like sardines on the cable car that goes up to the tower, but once you're there, you have the chance to spread out a bit. The views are absolutely worth the trip.  If you can time the trip with sunset, you will not be disappointed. We got to see the sun set over the city, and then took pictures with the city lights coming on. Just beautiful.",637,disappointed,"서울이 얼마나 큰지 실감하고 싶다면 이곳을 꼭 가보세요. 우리는 지하철을 타고 가파른 언덕을 올라 케이블카를 타는 곳으로 갔다. 그래도 거기까지 가는 버스가 있는 것 같아요. 거기에는 많은 사람들이 있었고 타워까지 올라가는 케이블카에서 정어리처럼 당신을 포장하지만 일단 거기에 가면 조금 퍼질 기회가 있습니다. 전망은 절대적으로 가치가 있습니다. 일몰과 함께 여행 시간을 정할 수 있다면 실망하지 않을 것입니다. 우리는 도시 위로 지는 태양을 보게 되었고, 도시의 불빛이 켜지면서 사진을 찍었습니다. 그냥 아름답다."
638,638,40,4151,We ate at the French place at the top and the food was better than any 4 star place in U.S. It was the only time in our 3 nights/4 days we didn't eat Korean and we were.not disappointed...the chef knows his stuff. Lots of show stuff during afternoon at base of tower too. Cool time. We took the tram up and loved it as well.,638,disappointed,우리는 정상의 프랑스 식당에서 먹었고 음식은 미국의 어떤 4 성급 장소보다 좋았습니다. 3 박 4 일 동안 우리가 한국을 먹지 않은 유일한 시간이었고 우리는 실망하지 않았습니다 ... 요리사 그의 물건을 알고 있습니다. 오후에는 타워 바닥에도 많은 쇼 물건이 있습니다. 멋진 시간. 우리는 트램을 탔고 그것을 좋아했습니다.
639,639,41,4205,"If you're coming here looking forward to a beautiful night view, you may get disappointed. I would only recommend the place for lovers / couples.",639,disappointed,아름다운 야경을 기대하며 이곳에 오시면 실망하실 수 있습니다. 나는 연인 / 커플에게만 장소를 추천합니다.
640,640,42,4437,"Went during the spring, and was carrying high hopes (as many reviewers stated it is beautiful) that it may surprise me to capture its beauty. But was very disappointed, it was concealed and couldnt view much. We queued for more than 3hrs plus just to go up to the tower to find disappointments. (imo) not worth :)",640,disappointed,"봄에 갔고 (많은 리뷰어들이 아름답다고 말했듯이) 그 아름다움을 포착하는 것이 나를 놀라게 할 수 있다는 높은 희망을 가지고있었습니다. 그러나 그것은 매우 실망스러웠고, 그것은 숨겨져 많이 볼 수 없었습니다. 우리는 실망을 찾기 위해 타워에 올라가기 위해 3 시간 이상을 대기열에 추가했습니다. (이모) 가치가 없습니다 :)"
641,641,43,4466,"While the Seoul Tower in its ever changing colored lights, looks beautiful and intriguing from afar, I was disappointed when actually standing on the 777 foot structure. Perhaps it was the timing of the season and or day but I felt it was a flop at the top. We decided to hike up the winding road full with the beauty of nature. Upon reaching where the buses park for transport up and down the mountain there is a small convenient store and restrooms before you enter into the attraction. Another steep pavement hike and we had arrived. Ice cream and other food vendors were plentiful along with a gift shop. There were several locks of love art projects structured like Christmas trees on one side and a stage on the other. Unfortunately there were no acts during this time period. There is an observatory higher up with a view that would not disappoint on a clear day. I don’t know if it was the smog of pollution fogging up the view the day I visited or the clouds. At best though, even through the smog you can see the outlines of buildings for what seems like forever in the grand city of Seoul.",641,disappointed,"시시각각 변하는 빛의 서울타워는 멀리서 봐도 아름답고 신기해 보이지만 실제로는 777피트 높이의 구조물에 서서는 실망했습니다. 아마도 그것은 계절과 또는 하루의 타이밍 이었지만 나는 그것이 정상에서 실패했다고 느꼈습니다. 우리는 자연의 아름다움이 가득한 구불구불한 길을 오르기로 결정했습니다. 산을 오르내리기 위해 버스가 주차한 곳에 도착하면 명소에 들어가기 전에 작은 편의점과 화장실이 있습니다. 또 다른 험한 포장 하이킹과 우리는 도착했다. 아이스크림과 다른 식품 판매점은 선물 가게와 함께 풍부했습니다. 한쪽에는 크리스마스 트리, 다른 한쪽에는 무대와 같은 구조의 러브 아트 프로젝트가 여러 개 있었습니다. 불행히도 이 기간 동안 활동이 없었습니다. 더 높은 곳에 전망대가 있어 맑은 날 실망시키지 않을 전망이다. 내가 방문한 날의 경치를 흐리게 하는 공해의 스모그인지 구름인지 모르겠다. 기껏해야 스모그 속에서도 서울이라는 대도시에서 영원할 것 같은 건물의 윤곽을 볼 수 있습니다."
642,642,44,4511,We took their cable car to the top and its a great place to overlook Seoul city. There are places for the couples to lock their love lock and take photos. Previously there was teddy museum but it was closed during our visit. A bit disappointed...,642,disappointed,우리는 케이블카를 타고 정상에 올라 서울 시내를 내려다 볼 수있는 좋은 장소였습니다. 커플들이 러브락을 잠그고 사진을 찍을 수 있는 장소가 있습니다. 이전에는 테디 박물관이 있었지만 우리가 방문하는 동안 문을 닫았습니다. 약간 실망...
643,643,45,4561,"In Seoul, our tour group visited the N Seoul Tower which is Korea’s transmission tower for television and radio broadcasts. It was raining that day and was crowded with holiday makers as it was the peak season in spring. We were quite disappointed as we cannot take many photographs of the scenery surrounding the Seoul Tower due to the rain and crowds. Our group followed our tour guide who took us to the tower by walking uphill. Even though we are fit, It was quite difficult to walk uphill especially in the rain and some parts up the hill are steep. We took the elevator to the tower’s Digital Observatory and spend less than an hour there as the place was getting crowded. We could see the city of Seoul and Mt. Namsam but some parts of the scenery foggy due to the rain. There’s a souvenir and snack shop at the observatory deck and my spouse bought a mini N Seoul Tower as a memento of our trip here. Prices at the souvenir shop are quite expensive! At one part of the tower, there are thousands of golden locks “Locks of Love” which are attached to the fences. It seems this is a recent attraction for courting couples to declare their undying affection at this place. Nothing special about this tower, as we have visited some nicer ones - Taipei's 101 and Shanghai's Oriental Pearl Tower!",643,disappointed,"서울에서 우리 투어 그룹은 텔레비전과 라디오 방송을 위한 한국의 전송 타워인 N 서울 타워를 방문했습니다. 이날은 비가 와서 봄철 성수기라 휴가객들로 붐볐다. 비와 인파로 인해 서울타워 주변 풍경을 사진에 많이 담지 못해서 많이 아쉬웠습니다. 우리 그룹은 오르막길을 걸어 탑으로 우리를 데려간 여행 가이드를 따랐습니다. 우리는 건강하지만 특히 비와 언덕의 일부 부분이 가파르게 오르막을 걷는 것은 꽤 어려웠습니다. 우리는 엘리베이터를 타고 타워의 디지털 천문대로 갔고 장소가 붐벼서 한 시간도 채 걸리지 않았습니다. 서울 시내와 남삼산이 보이지만 비로 인해 일부 풍경이 뿌옇게 흐려졌다. 전망대에는 기념품과 스낵 가게가 있고 제 배우자는 여기 여행의 기념품으로 미니 N 서울 타워를 샀습니다. 기념품 가게의 가격은 꽤 비쌉니다! 타워의 한 부분에는 울타리에 붙어있는 수천 개의 황금 자물쇠 ""사랑의 자물쇠""가 있습니다. 최근 이곳에서 변함없는 애정을 과시하기 위해 구애를 하는 커플들이 많이 찾는 곳인 것 같다. 타이페이의 101 타워와 상하이의 동방명주 타워와 같은 더 멋진 타워를 방문했기 때문에 이 타워에는 특별한 것이 없습니다!"
644,644,46,4650,"Although the view from the top of the tower is outstanding, I quite dislike the merchandising, the stores, the accessibility of the spot...There is a teddy bear museum for instance, which is totally unrelated and not worth a penny. If you are just coming fot the view, it s perfect, but you will be disappointed if you wanted a cool hangout",644,disappointed,"타워 꼭대기에서 내려다보는 전망은 훌륭하지만, 나는 상품화, 상점, 그 자리의 접근성을 상당히 싫어합니다. 예를 들어 테디베어 박물관이 있는데 전혀 관련이 없고 한푼도 가치가 없습니다. 전망만 보고 오신다면 완벽하지만 시원한 수다방을 원하신다면 실망하실 겁니다."
645,645,47,4716,"You can actually walk to the base of the N Tower but most people wait on the line to take the cable car. The view from the park around the base of the tower is better than the view from the top of the tower (costs extra) so you might as well save yourself the time waiting on another line and the $. The souvenir store is so brightly lit that you can only see out the window if you cup your hands around your face, and that's if you can get past all the greasy smudges from everyone who has already been there before you. My sister & I were extremely disappointed.",645,disappointed,실제로 N 타워 기슭까지 걸어갈 수 있지만 대부분의 사람들은 케이블카를 타기 위해 줄을 서서 기다립니다. 타워 바닥 주변의 공원에서 바라보는 전망은 타워 꼭대기에서 바라보는 전망보다 더 좋으므로(추가 비용) 다른 라인에서 기다리는 시간을 절약할 수 있습니다. 기념품 가게는 조명이 너무 밝아서 손으로 얼굴을 감싸야만 창밖을 볼 수 있습니다. 그래야 이미 가본 모든 사람들의 기름기 많은 얼룩을 지울 수 있습니다. 내 여동생과 나는 매우 실망했습니다.

648,648,50,4848,"The Seoul Tower is located on the South Mountain, and supposedly you could command a spectacular view of the Seoul skyline. The reality, however; left much to be desired.  1. the line: there was a huge line to buy tickets, and to wait for the lift, and again to come back down the mountain, mostly by local tourists and chinese tourists who come as groups or individually. a wildly popular korean drama had some scenes here, so i suppose that's the main reason for the upsurge in popularity. i came here with my girlfriend late at night, around 9PM (the lifts close at ten), hoping to avoid the crowds, but still managed to wait for over an hour all together to go up and come down. We spent no more than 15 min on the top.  2. the prices were expensive, you pay for the cable car, as well as the elevator in the tower, which is only 200 something meters, furthermore, the Seoul skyline isn't all that attractive to be honest, don't get me wrong, i love the city's youthful energy and friendly people, its just that as a city, it is nowhere near NYC, HK, Shanghai, or Paris in terms of grandeur or overall aesthetic effect on the eye. For me, it was really just a bunch of high rises in the distance and tourists and souvenir stalls next to me. So unfortunately, I was left rather disappointed by the visit.",648,disappointed,"서울 타워는 남산에 위치하고 있어 서울 스카이라인의 멋진 전망을 감상할 수 있을 것입니다. 그러나 현실은; 많이 남았습니다. 1. 줄 : 표를 사고, 리프트를 기다리고, 다시 산으로 내려오기 위해 엄청난 줄을 섰다. 주로 단체나 개인으로 오는 현지 관광객과 중국 관광객들이 많았다. 한국에서 인기를 끌었던 드라마가 몇 장면 있었는데, 그게 인기가 급상승한 가장 큰 이유인 것 같아요. 나는 밤 늦게 여자 친구와 함께 군중을 피하기 위해 오후 9시경(엘리베이터가 10시에 닫힘)에 왔지만 여전히 함께 올라가고 내려오기까지 1시간 이상을 기다릴 수 있었습니다. 우리는 정상에서 15 분 이상을 보내지 않았습니다. 2. 가격이 비쌌고, 케이블카와 타워의 엘리베이터도 200미터 밖에 안 되는 거리에, 더군다나 서울의 스카이라인은 솔직히 매력적이지 않습니다. 틀렸습니다. 저는 이 도시의 젊음의 에너지와 친절한 사람들을 사랑합니다. 도시로서 웅장함이나 전체적인 미학적 효과 측면에서 NYC, HK, 상하이 또는 파리 근처에 없다는 것입니다. 저에게는 정말 저 멀리 보이는 고층 건물들과 제 옆에 관광객들과 기념품 가게들이 가득했습니다. 그래서 불행히도 나는 방문에 다소 실망했습니다."

Queued for about 1.5 hours before even making the cable car flight, in a waiting room crammed full of tourists, and little ventilation. The room was filthy, with people dropping their trash all over the place, and no-one cleaning it up. Not ideal, but we dealt.  When we eventually made it to the tower foyer and the top of the hill, we were presented with a further wait whilst we waited our turn to ascend the tower itself.  After our expedition to the top, we were quite disappointed. The windows were really dirty, which made photographs, and the general view, pretty poor. There were no outside viewing areas, and they really pile the punters into this tower, so there's very little room for manoeuvre. There's also a pick'n'mix candy store which is just absolutely ridiculous.  Probably worth a visit if you're in the area, but you should try to go early in the day to avoid the crazy queues.",649,disappointed,"나는 스카이 타워를 사랑하지만 이 경험은 최고가 아니었습니다. 멀리서 보면 N서울타워가 우뚝 솟아 있습니다. 우리의 경험은 세련된 것과는 거리가 멀었습니다. 케이블카를 타기도 전에 약 1시간 30분 동안 줄을 서서 관광객들로 붐비는 대기실과 환기가 거의 되지 않는 대기실. 방은 더럽고 사람들이 쓰레기를 사방에 버리고 아무도 청소하지 않았습니다. 이상적이지는 않지만 처리했습니다. 우리가 결국 타워 로비와 언덕 꼭대기에 도착했을 때 우리는 타워 자체를 오를 차례를 기다리는 동안 더 기다려야 했습니다. 정상을 향한 탐험 후 우리는 상당히 실망했습니다. 창문이 정말 더러워서 사진이 찍혔고, 전체적인 전망은 꽤 나빴습니다. 외부를 볼 수 있는 공간이 없었고, 실제로 이 타워에 펀터를 쌓았기 때문에 조작할 공간이 거의 없었습니다. 정말 말도 안되는 픽앤믹스 캔디 가게도 있습니다. 아마 당신이 그 지역에 있다면 방문할 가치가 있지만, 미친 대기열을 피하기 위해 하루 일찍 가도록 노력해야 합니다."
650,650,52,5009,"So an earlier review said this was better for couples and most reviews were positive but having gone based on these reviews I felt disappointed at the end. The area is clean and the views are nice, and we certainly enjoyed the long walk their from our hotel. Inside however, you are hit by the 'candy sweet' smell of popcorn while queueing for your ticket. Their are different options available, and since we were there at lunch we opted for the 'couples package' which included trips to the viewing deck (for two people, despite the board saying one person only) and lunch in their 'Italian' restaurant. Once inside the lift you are told to look up where, on the lift ceiling, they play a techno high speed video that you can't focus on and if anything made us both feel weird as the elevator was ascending. Then once inside the place is full of 'pick and mix' sweets and crap for kids. How someone has suggested that the attraction was suited to couples is beyond me. The restaurant was the biggest let down. We were greeted and seated in an awful spot with a huge vent blocking the view (the restaurant was 99% empty at the time). Then, with virtually no English (unlike most people we met in Korea who speak quite good English) we were offered only two pasta plates, carbonara or arrabiato, neither of which we wanted. This was also to share - NOT a plate each! This hugely limited choice, given such a varied menu, was never indicated at the ticket office. It also did not include any drinks which, you guessed it, cost the earth compared to normal places. The food when it arrived was then totally different. We had a smoked salmon salad which may have been nice be it for the gallon of dressing covering everything - the pasta was well cooked but ruined by streaky bacon, and also a margarita pizza was served but the base was literally thinner than a crepe!  The views from the base surrounding the tower are just as good as inside. I would recommend the walk and to visit the various viewing points... The tower its self is very average and i certainly would not be conned into a meal package as conned is how we felt.",650,disappointed,"그래서 이전 리뷰는 이것이 커플에게 더 낫다고 말했고 대부분의 리뷰는 긍정적이었지만 이 리뷰를 기반으로 가니 결국 실망했습니다. 이 지역은 깨끗하고 전망이 좋으며 호텔에서 긴 산책을 즐겼습니다. 그러나 내부에서 티켓을 기다리는 동안 팝콘의 '단단한 사탕' 냄새가 납니다. 그들은 다른 옵션을 사용할 수 있으며 우리는 점심 시간에 거기에 있었기 때문에 전망대로의 여행(2인용, 게시판에는 1인만 해당)과 '이탈리아' 레스토랑에서의 점심 식사가 포함된 '커플 패키지'를 선택했습니다. 엘리베이터 안에 들어가면 엘리베이터 천장에서 집중할 수 없는 테크노 고속 비디오가 재생되고 엘리베이터가 오를 때 우리 둘 다 이상하게 느껴지는 경우가 있는지 살펴보라고 합니다. 그런 다음 그 장소에 들어가면 아이들을 위한 '선택 및 혼합' 과자와 쓰레기로 가득 차 있습니다. 누군가가 그 매력이 커플에게 적합하다고 제안한 방법은 저를 넘어선 것입니다. 레스토랑은 가장 큰 실망이었습니다. 우리는 인사를 받고 전망을 차단하는 거대한 통풍구가있는 끔찍한 장소에 앉았습니다 (식당은 당시 99 % 비어있었습니다). 그런 다음 영어가 거의 없는 상태에서(한국에서 만난 대부분의 영어를 구사하는 사람들과 달리) 우리는 두 가지 파스타 접시, 즉 까르보나라 또는 아라비아토만 제공받았습니다. 둘 다 우리가 원하지 않았습니다. 이것은 또한 공유하기 위한 것이었습니다. 각각의 접시가 아닙니다! 이렇게 다양한 메뉴가 주어진 매우 제한된 선택은 매표소에 표시되지 않았습니다. 그것은 또한 당신이 짐작할 수 있듯이 일반적인 장소에 비해 지구를 희생시키는 어떤 음료도 포함하지 않았습니다. 도착했을 때 음식은 완전히 달랐습니다. 우리는 모든 것을 덮는 1갤런의 드레싱이 좋았을 수도 있는 훈제 연어 샐러드를 먹었습니다. 파스타는 잘 요리되었지만 줄무늬 베이컨으로 인해 망가졌고 마가리타 피자도 제공되었지만 베이스는 문자 그대로 크레이프보다 얇았습니다! 타워를 둘러싸고 있는 기지에서 바라보는 전망은 내부만큼이나 좋습니다. 나는 산책을 추천하고 다양한 전망대를 방문하는 것이 좋습니다. . . 타워 자체는 매우 평균적이며 우리가 어떻게 느꼈는지에 따라 식사 패키지에 속지 않을 것입니다."

Because the air conditioning was not turned on and it was summer, hence it was hot and stuffy, so we didn't stay long in the tower. So I recommend that it is not a must-do to pay quite an expensive fee to go up the tower.  However, the ground level view is good enough to get an aerial bird's eye view of the city. The air is fresh because of all the greenery and we wished we had brought food to do a picnic in the namsan park. This offers a good break from the hustle and bustle of city life, but beware of the touristy crowds that tend to flood the place.",652,disappointed,우리는 타워에 올라가기 위해 티켓을 샀지만 일단 올라가면 약간 실망했습니다. 에어컨도 안 틀고 여름이라 덥고 답답해서 타워에서 오래 머물지 못했어요. 그래서 탑에 오르기 위해 꽤 비싼 비용을 지불하는 것은 필수가 아닌 것을 추천합니다. 그러나 지상 뷰는 도시의 공중 조감도를 얻기에 충분합니다. 모든 녹지 때문에 공기가 신선하고 우리는 남산 공원에서 피크닉을 할 음식을 가져 오기를 바랐습니다. 이것은 도시 생활의 번잡함에서 좋은 휴식을 제공하지만 장소를 범람하는 경향이 있는 관광객 인파를 조심하십시오.

From there, it was an uphill walk towards the tower. Up at the plaza area, we could still enjoy some good views of the city below us. The weather wasn't perfect, but we still went up to the Seoul Tower for a higher view. We took the elevator up and were taken by surprise with the motion-graphics display inside the lift. It made us feel like astronauts traveling in a space shuttle into the galaxy. At the observatory, we were disappointed with the 360⁰ view due to the fog.

It was a long hike with stairs and its tiring. So I recommend to take the cable car if you are with kids or if you dont plan to exercise 😂😂 N seoul tower itself was nice, the view was great !! 😍 its mostly just enjoying the view and also chilling around that area ! So if you love looking at the views and take photographs then this is for you otherwise there’s nothing much to do.",678,much,N 서울 타워를 방문하는 방법은 케이블카를 이용하는 방법과 하이킹을 이용하는 방법이 있습니다. 케이블카 대기시간이 1시간이라 남매와 나는 등산을 하기로 했다. 계단이 많고 피곤한 긴 하이킹이었습니다. 그래서 아이들과 함께 가거나 운동을 할 계획이 없다면 케이블카를 타는 것을 추천합니다 😂😂 N서울타워 자체도 좋고 뷰도 좋았어요!! 😍 대부분은 경치를 즐기고 그 지역에서 차가워지는 것입니다! 따라서 전망을보고 사진을 찍는 것을 좋아한다면 이것은 당신을위한 것입니다. 그렇지 않으면 할 일이별로 없습니다.
679,679,23,484,"We went up by cable car and when we arrived we found the whole area looked very dated. Admittedly, there are very good views from the top of the tower but we thought there are much better places to visit than here, unless you've got plenty of time in Seoul. By all means, go and have a look but ensure the sky's clear because you'd only go up there for the views, the tower itself and immediate surrounding areas are a little underwhelming, and that includes the Hello Kitty Island experience which I can only recommend if you are a die-hard Hello Kitty fan. Even for the likes of us, who find Hello Kitty quite cute, it was not worth our time.",679,much,우리는 케이블카로 올라갔고 우리가 도착했을 때 우리는 전체 지역이 매우 낡아 보였다는 것을 알았습니다. 물론 타워 꼭대기에서 바라보는 전망도 아주 좋지만 서울에서 시간이 충분하지 않다면 여기보다 더 좋은 곳이 있을 거라고 생각했습니다. 꼭 올라가서 하늘이 맑은지 확인하세요. 타워 자체와 바로 주변 지역은 약간 실망스럽습니다. 여기에는 내가 할 수 있는 헬로키티 아일랜드 체험만 포함됩니다. 열혈 헬로 키티 팬이라면 추천합니다. 헬로 키티가 꽤 귀엽다고 생각하는 우리 같은 사람들에게도 시간이 아깝지 않았습니다.
680,680,24,488,"So we recently visited the tower and I thought I might write down how we went about it and some suggestions. --------------------------------- When to go:  So we visited in early August and found that the best time to to go was the evening (of course this will depend on weather and month etc) . I would suggest you arrive at the tower by 7.00pm and be on the viewing platform by 7.30pm, as by 8.00pm it will be dark. This will allow you to view Seoul during the golden hour, sunset and night (when the whole city lights up). This will probably be one of the more busier times though, so beware. If you want a less busy experience maybe go early morning or around lunch and be don't visit on a weekend but a weekday. ---------------------------- How to get there:  We were staying in myengdong area which conveniently had a bus that takes about 15 mins to go directly to the entrance of Seoul tower. It comes every 15 mins and costs around 1,200 won without a tcard and 1,100 with. For those staying in myengdong the bus stop is to the right of myengdong Station entrance 2. The bus you will need to catch is the no. 5. Those staying in chongmyeong can catch either the no. 2 or 5. There are other methods of getting there. You could taxi or get the train to the bottom of the park and get the cable car up.  I would suggest that if you want to walk the hill/ Park area to get to the tower, that you should walk down instead of up. It is a step climb up, with quite alot of stairs and steep slopes. It would take you a good 30 mins plus to get to the top and you will be tired. ----------------------- Seoul tower Park:  So beneath Seoul tower is a sort of park area with a few viewing platforms, one of which is covered in love locks. I would recommend getting some of your photos group photos here. Its a little less busy and the view is almost as good. Beneath the tower there are many places to eat and shops. --------------------------- Seoul tower  The tickets can be bought online and at the tower. We bought at the tower and don't encounyer much of a queue. Tickets cost 10,000 won per adult and 8000 won for children and seniors. They are open tickets which mean there are no time slots allocated. You can enter the tower when you please and stay as long as you like.  There is one main viewing platform and it will be busy but the views are stunning. If you find yourself needing to get away from the hubub I would suggest you go down to the next level (sub viewing platform) and go to the toilet. Each has its own private view and the facilities are very nice.  I saw quite places to eat on each level with lots of different choices e.g Italian, Korean,  Chinese etc. I don't, however, know how much it costs. ------------------- Getting down:  When finished there are multiple ways to get down. The bus which you took to go up, the cable car and the walk. The cable car costs 7000 per adult and takes about 10-15 mins to get down to the bottom where it will drop you off near myengodon, where you can get to myengdong Station or just walk home.  However, if you are feeling up to it I would suggest walking down.  The path is well light, nicely paved with great views all the way down. It has a great view of the tower and its a nice stroll through the park area. The path is just left of the cable car when facing down the hill. I think it took us about 20 mins to get down. You will just about the reach the same area that the cable car will drop you off at. From there its a 10-15 min walk back to myengdong main street. --------------------- Worth it?  I believe so but I am a sucker for a good view and a relative payed for most of the trip. I can see how it may fall flat for many as it is very busy tourist hot spot which is arguably overpriced. I believe families should see this is as one of their big nights out. I still think those on a budget should go but maybe limit there spending by walking and taking snacks up with them to eat in the park. While Seoul tower is arguably the most iconic, there are still other platforms you can choose from. Also, if you were just viewing during the day and wanted a challenge then instead of observation decks go to some of the mountains that surround the city. We went to bukhansan (1/2 day quite hard hiking) which has amazing views.  Hope this helps people out. Sorry its so long, thought the detail would be good. --------- Protip: For those who do go in the evening (who are treating this like one of their big nights out) and finish the tower looking for dinner I would suggest going to woori Garden korean bbq in myengdong. Amazing stuff.",680,much,"그래서 우리는 최근에 타워를 방문했고 우리가 그것에 대해 어떻게 했는지와 몇 가지 제안을 적어볼 수 있을 거라고 생각했습니다. ---------------------------------- 갈 때: 그래서 우리는 8월 초에 방문했고 가장 좋은 시기는 가는 것은 저녁이었다 (물론 이것은 날씨와 달 등에 달려 있을 것이다). 오후 7시까지 타워에 도착하고 오후 7시 30분까지 전망대에 도착하는 것이 좋습니다. 이렇게 하면 골든 아워, 일몰, 밤(도시 전체가 밝을 때) 동안 서울을 볼 수 있습니다. 이것은 아마도 가장 바쁜 시간 중 하나가 될 것이므로 조심하십시오. 덜 바쁜 경험을 원한다면 이른 아침이나 점심 시간에 가서 주말이 아닌 평일에 방문하십시오. ---------------------------- 찾아가는 방법: 버스가 15분 정도 소요되는 편리한 명동 지역에 머물고 있었습니다. 서울타워 입구로 직진. 15분 간격으로 오고 요금은 티카드 없이 1,200원, 있으면 1,100원입니다. 명동에 머무시는 분들은 버스정류장이 명동역 2번출구 오른쪽에 있습니다. 타야 할 버스는 2번입니다. 5. 총명에 머무는 사람들은 어느 쪽이든 잡을 수 있습니다. 2 또는 5. 거기에 가는 다른 방법이 있습니다. 당신은 택시를 타거나 기차를 타고 공원 바닥까지 가서 케이블카를 탈 수 있습니다. 언덕 / 공원 지역을 걸어서 타워에 가려면 위로 걸어가는 대신 아래로 걸어가는 것이 좋습니다. 꽤 많은 계단과 가파른 경사가 있는 계단 오르막입니다. 정상까지 가려면 30분 정도 더 걸리고 피곤할 것입니다. ----------------------- 서울 타워 공원: 서울 타워 아래에는 몇 개의 전망대가 있는 일종의 공원 지역이 있습니다. 그 중 하나는 사랑으로 덮여 있습니다. 자물쇠. 나는 당신의 사진 단체 사진 중 일부를 여기에서 얻는 것이 좋습니다. 조금 덜 바쁘고 전망이 거의 비슷합니다. 타워 아래에는 먹을 곳과 상점이 많이 있습니다. --------------------------- 서울 타워 티켓은 온라인과 타워에서 구입할 수 있습니다. 우리는 타워에서 샀고 대기열이 많이 필요하지 않습니다. 입장료는 어른 1만원, 어린이와 시니어 8000원이다. 그들은 할당된 시간 슬롯이 없음을 의미하는 공개 티켓입니다. 원하는 시간에 타워에 들어가 원하는 만큼 머무를 수 있습니다. 하나의 주요 관람 플랫폼이 있으며 혼잡할 것이지만 전망은 훌륭합니다. 허브에서 벗어나야 하는 자신을 발견하면 다음 레벨(하위 전망대)로 내려가 화장실에 가는 것이 좋습니다. 각각의 전용 뷰가 있으며 시설이 매우 좋습니다. 나는 이탈리아, 한국, 중국 등 다양한 선택으로 각 층에서 먹을 수 있는 곳을 보았지만 비용이 얼마인지는 모릅니다. ------------------- 내리기: 끝나면 여러 가지 방법으로 내릴 수 있습니다. 올라가기 위해 탔던 버스와 케이블카, 그리고 도보. 케이블카 요금은 성인 1인당 7000이며, 바닥까지 약 10-15분이 소요되며, 이곳에서 면동역까지 가거나 걸어서 집에 갈 수 있는 면고돈 근처에서 하차합니다. 그래도 괜찮다면 내려가는 걸 추천합니다. 길은 잘 가벼우며 아래로 내려가는 내내 멋진 전망을 즐길 수 있도록 잘 포장되어 있습니다. 타워의 멋진 전망과 공원 지역을 산책하는 것이 좋습니다. 길은 언덕 아래로 향할 때 케이블카 바로 왼쪽에 있습니다. 내려오는 데 20분 정도 걸린 것 같아요. 케이블카가 내리는 곳과 거의 같은 지역에 도달하게 됩니다. 거기에서 명동 메인 스트리트까지 도보로 10-15분이 소요됩니다. ---------- 가치가 있습니까? 나는 그렇게 믿는다. 그러나 나는 좋은 전망과 친척이 대부분의 여행에 대해 지불하는 빨판이다. 틀림없이 고가의 매우 바쁜 관광 명소이기 때문에 많은 사람들에게 그것이 어떻게 평평해질 수 있는지 알 수 있습니다. 나는 가족들이 이것이 그들의 큰 밤 중 하나임을 알아야 한다고 믿습니다. 나는 여전히 예산이 있는 사람들이 가야 한다고 생각하지만 공원에서 식사를 하기 위해 산책을 하고 간식을 챙겨가는 것으로 지출을 제한할 수 있습니다. 서울 타워는 틀림없이 가장 상징적이지만 선택할 수 있는 다른 플랫폼이 있습니다. 또한 낮에 구경만 하고 도전하고 싶다면 전망대 대신 도시를 둘러싸고 있는 산으로 가보세요. 우리는 놀라운 전망을 가진 북한산(1/2일 꽤 힘든 하이킹)에 갔다. 이것이 사람들을 돕기를 바랍니다. 너무 길어서 죄송합니다. 세부 사항이 좋을 것이라고 생각했습니다. --------- Protip: 저녁에 가서 저녁을 먹으러 타워를 끝내고 저녁에 가는 사람들(명동에 있는 우리 가든 한식 바베큐에 가는 것을 추천합니다) . 놀라운 물건."

There are several restaurants should you feel hungry and want to eat. There is a convenience store for your basic needs. If you are travelling with very small children and elderly, it may be a challenge walking up the steep hill leading to the tower. There is a portion there where there are trees where you can attach your lock as a remembrance until the next time you visit the tower. The best way to reach the top is by car, if not, bus.

First of all, you can't get up to the tower area itself without walking up or taking a city bus or being part of a tour. No cars are allowed. That part was okay as we did go up by bus. What was disappointing was that it seemed very commercialized. There was a fee to go to the top of the tower. That was understandable but then.they take a photo of you when you enter which of course comes with a price tag. And it was extra to go into the Hello Kitty area which seemed like a promo store??? We didn't go in. Don't get me wrong, the view was nice from the top and outside where you have the love locks and park area. I guess I'm just a bit jaded because of my disappointment.

It was quite a hike from Myeongdong to the cable car station to bring us up the tower (I forgot how much but around 9000 won roundtrip), but it’s manageable. After getting off the cable car, you can already see colorful “love locks” all over; you can place your own. (If you don’t have a lock they sell it there.) You can also take photos of the Tower from that area. Then there is an option to pay to get up the N tower itself. Since we didn’t want to eat another buffet meal, we only got the tickets with pizza and pasta meal for 2 (not at the top of the tower though), but the pizza especially was superb. At the tower itself, we didn’t need to stay long; 15-20 minutes was more than enough. It was fun to play the interactive booth game though, where you can say hi to people at the Busan tower. :)",699,much,지난 2번의 서울 방문을 건너뛰었기 때문에 여기에 갔습니다. 명동에서 케이블카 정류장까지 타워까지 올라가는 길이 꽤 길었지만(얼마인지는 기억나지 않지만 왕복 9000원 정도) 관리할 만하다. 케이블카에서 내리면 이미 형형색색의 사랑의 자물쇠가 곳곳에 보입니다. 당신은 당신의 자신을 배치 할 수 있습니다. (자물쇠가 없으면 그곳에서 판매합니다.) 그 지역에서 타워의 사진을 찍을 수도 있습니다. 그런 다음 N 타워 자체를 올라가기 위해 지불하는 옵션이 있습니다. 우리는 다른 뷔페 식사를 먹고 싶지 않았기 때문에 2 인분의 피자와 파스타 식사가 포함 된 티켓 만 얻었지만 (타워 꼭대기는 아니지만) 피자는 특히 훌륭했습니다. 타워 자체에서 우리는 오래 머물 필요가 없었습니다. 15~20분이면 충분했다. 그래도 부산타워에서 사람들과 인사를 나눌 수 있는 인터랙티브 부스 게임은 재미있었습니다. :)

There is a deal for two at 22K W for two tickets + 2 drinks and 2 popcorn's (heavily stuffed with butter), and upon entering it looked very strange to the team there that we (as two tourists) didn't want to get ourselves pictured for an overpriced photo set (1 for 15K W and it goes on...)  Once we reached up we discovered that it is almost impossible to get a clear sight in the night because of the merchandise and internal lights that these boots are reflecting. All the surrounding windows had reflection of everything you see inside (people shopping, lights of candy stores etc.) and you could not take a decent photo with those reflections.

The trip up is about two minutes in the cable car, but they reallllly cram people in that thing. The views from the main platforms of the tower were excellent and it was nice to see the love locks as well. They have lots of food options there as well. I did not pay to go up to the observation deck, since I thought it was overpriced, especially when you get such good views from the free platforms. Please note, this is a super crowded attraction, so prepare yourself for that.

706,706,50,685,"Well, what to say really? Yes, it's obvious what the place is, it's a VERY popular tower on top of a mountain with viewing platform and restraunts up there. An yes, Korean restraunt up there was really nice and I'll review that separately. But as for the tower, the queue for the cable car up was easily 30 minutes, problems more like 40 plus, and this was a Sunday night. Don't be fooled by the queue for the tickets on ground level, that's just the start of your long, long quest to the top of the building, to get the cable car to the top of the mountain. I call it a quest, as it's almost something worthy of two small hobbits. I had read reviews that mentioned the queues, however I didn't quite read in enough detail to prepare for the queues that lay ahead, and I'm British, we're known for queueing, but I now think we should be handing that title for the Koreans. Then, once you finally get on the cable car and get to the top of the mountain, you can stop and have a look at the views from there, and then queue a further 40 minutes for the lifts up the tower proper. Now a good tip here, is to book a restaurant package to go up the tower, as this skips the lift queue up for you. View from the top is nice, but without the restaurant meal, it would have menat 80 minutes plus of queueing to get there. Then, to come down, repeat all the queuing again, so it was 40 miuntes to the bottom of the tower, which sadly the restaurant meal does not enable you to skip, and then another 40 minutes for the cable car. I know there's a bus to the top that misses the cable car, and we didn't try those so can't comment.

There are some restrictions for those putting theirs up and if you don't follow their rules, your lock will be removed at the end of the night. Good view from the tower of the City but like every other tourist stop, a bit over priced. Entrance fee is separate from the cable car ride getting there.",714,much,이 타워는 여행을 하는 동안 찾을 수 있는 타워와 거의 동일합니다. 독특한 점은 주변에 있습니다. 타워까지 이어지는 수백 개의 자물쇠에는 가드 난간에 잠겨 있는 커플 이름이 적힌 수백 개의 자물쇠가 있습니다. 잠그는 사람들에게는 몇 가지 제한 사항이 있으며 규칙을 따르지 않으면 밤이 끝날 때 자물쇠가 제거됩니다. 도시의 타워에서 좋은 전망이지만 다른 모든 관광 명소와 마찬가지로 가격이 조금 비쌉니다. 입장료는 케이블카를 타고 가는 것과 별개입니다.
715,715,59,816,"Well, what to say really? Yes, it's obvious what the place is, it's a VERY popular tower on top of a mountain with viewing platform and restraunts up there. An yes, Korean restraunt up there was really nice and I'll review that separately. But as for the tower, the queue for the cable car up was easily 30 minutes, problems more like 40 plus, and this was a Sunday night. Don't be fooled by the queue for the tickets on ground level, that's just the start of your long, long quest to the top of the building, to get the cable car to the top of the mountain. I call it a quest, as it's almost something worthy of two small hobbits. I had read reviews that mentioned the queues, however I didn't quite read in enough detail to prepare for the queues that lay ahead, and I'm British, we're known for queueing, but I now think we should be handing that title for the Koreans. Then, once you finally get on the cable car and get to the top of the mountain, you can stop and have a look at the views from there, and then queue a further 40 minutes for the lifts up the tower proper. Now a good tip here, is to book a restaurant package to go up the tower, as this skips the lift queue up for you. View from the top is nice, but without the restaurant meal, it would have menat 80 minutes plus of queueing to get there. Then, to come down, repeat all the queuing again, so it was 40 miuntes to the bottom of the tower, which sadly the restaurant meal does not enable you to skip, and then another 40 minutes for the cable car. I know there's a bus to the top that misses the cable car, and we didn't try those so can't comment. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also climb the mountain on foot, althouh we thought that for an evening dinner out that might be a bit much. Overall a nice view, if you patient enough for the queues.",715,much,"글쎄요, 정말 뭐라고 할까요? 예, 장소가 무엇인지는 분명합니다. 전망대와 레스토랑이 있는 산 꼭대기에 있는 매우 인기 있는 타워입니다. 예, 거기에 있는 한국 식당은 정말 좋았고 별도로 리뷰하겠습니다. 그러나 타워의 경우 케이블카를 타기 위한 대기열은 쉽게 30분, 문제는 40분 이상이었고 일요일 밤이었습니다. 지상층의 티켓을 기다리는 대기열에 속지 마세요. 케이블카를 타고 산 정상까지 올라가기 위한 길고 긴 여정의 시작일 뿐입니다. 나는 그것을 퀘스트라고 부르는데, 그것은 거의 두 명의 작은 호빗에게 가치가 있는 일이기 때문입니다. 대기열에 대해 언급한 리뷰를 읽었지만 앞으로 닥칠 대기열에 대비할 만큼 충분히 자세히 읽지 않았습니다. 저는 영국인이고 대기열로 유명하지만 지금은 그것을 전달해야 한다고 생각합니다. 한국인의 타이틀. 그런 다음 마침내 케이블카를 타고 산 꼭대기에 도착하면 멈춰서 그곳에서 전망을 볼 수 있습니다. 그런 다음 타워를 제대로 올라가는 리프트를 위해 40분 더 대기할 수 있습니다. 이제 여기에서 좋은 팁은 타워에 올라가기 위해 레스토랑 패키지를 예약하는 것입니다. 이렇게 하면 리프트 대기열을 건너뛸 수 있습니다. 정상에서의 전망은 좋지만 레스토랑 식사가 없으면 거기에 도착하기 위해 80분을 더 기다려야 합니다. 그런 다음 내려오려면 모든 대기열을 다시 반복하십시오. 그래서 타워 바닥까지 40분이 걸렸습니다. 슬프게도 레스토랑 식사를 건너뛸 수는 없으며 케이블카를 타려면 40분을 더 가야 합니다. 나는 케이블카를 놓치는 정상에 버스가 있다는 것을 알고 있고 우리는 그것을 시도하지 않았으므로 논평할 수 없다. 모험심이 강하다면 도보로 산을 오를 수도 있습니다. 하지만 저녁 외식을 하기에는 양이 좀 많을 거라 생각했습니다. 대기열에 대해 충분히 참을 경우 전반적으로 멋진 전망입니다."
716,716,60,834,Here's the scoop : don't take a taxi. Just take bus 02 or 05 from some areas around the city including Myeongdong and it brings you all the up to the base of the tower. It's only 1200 for adults 350 for kids. Same thing when you are returning back. The cable car is 7000 one way for adults and connects from the base of the tower to a middle station. For us we have been in many before and it didn't justify the short ride. Spend some 1-1.5 hours at the base of the tower and take in the beautiful views of the city. The weather was great and we took lots of photos. And we didn't pay to go up the tower because every country has a talk tower and it's pretty much the same 😀,716,much,"특종은 다음과 같습니다. 택시를 타지 마십시오. 명동을 포함한 시내 일부 지역에서 02번 또는 05번 버스를 타면 타워 기슭까지 모두 모입니다. 성인은 1200, 어린이는 350입니다. 돌아올 때도 마찬가지입니다. 케이블카는 성인 편도 7000이며, 타워 기단에서 중간역까지 연결된다. 우리는 이전에 많은 경험을 했고 짧은 여행을 정당화하지 못했습니다. 타워 기슭에서 약 1-1.5 시간을 보내고 도시의 아름다운 전망을 감상하십시오. 날씨가 좋아서 사진을 많이 찍었습니다. 그리고 우리는 모든 나라에 토크 타워가 있고 거의 비슷하기 때문에 타워를 오르는 데 비용을 지불하지 않았습니다 😀"
717,717,61,835,"Another reviewer said ""...Yes, there is a cable car. But the hike is very easy - it's reasonably flat and you get pretty good views all the way up."" That is what it said in the book on Seoul that I bought in Honolulu before going to Seoul. My wife and I found the opposite to be true. I took as 3 hours to get from where out taxi dropped us off to the top. In retrospect there was a Bus stop sign at the bottom but no idea when it might come so we elected to walk. Three hours later (with seven yellow busses passing us going up during the time it took us to walk there) we arrived with my wife very sore legs and mad. ""Reasonably Flat""... I don't think so.. I would call it steep.  Once we finally arrived it was nice. We went to the upper level W 10,000 each, and got a framed souvenir photo W 25,000 which was nice... you can choose your background of views from the tower.  Unfortunately, it was very cloudy that day, and we couldn't see much of anything of the city from the tower, but they did warn us about that before charging us to go to the upper level, and after that hike we wanted to go up anyway. I think i would be spectacular when it is not cloudy... it was just our bad luck the weather was like that. I hope someday we can go there when the weather is good!  We enjoyed the fence where the lovers attach the padlocks with their names together and took some pictures there, and the Vanilla Shake at the Ice Cream concession was delicious.  We decided to take the cable car back down, which was scenic, but we found that once we arrived it was a long walk to MyongDong Subway Station, which the map implies was colocated with the Cable Car terminal... it is not. It is also a steep road from the Cable Car terminal down, so if you were going to walk up from the MyongDong Subway Station to the cable car terminal it would be quite a hike... although certainly less than the alternative hiking trail.  If we go there again I would either: 1. Wait for the Yellow Bus at the bottom of the Hiking Trail where the taxi dropped us off ... I think he sign at the top said the Bus was only W 1,200 or something like that.  OR 2. Insist that the taxi take you all the way to the Cable Car terminal... and get the hotel or somebody to write that in Korean to show the driver since it appears none of the taxi driver's understand English.  The fare for the Cable Car is almost the same for round trip as one way, so IF you can be sure the taxi will take you all the way to the Cable Car terminal that is probably the best choice. Otherwise the Yellow Bus from the bottom of the hiking trail.  Aside from that I agree with all the other observations of the review by EmmaVestrheim.",717,much,"다른 평론가는 ""...네, 케이블카가 있습니다. 하지만 하이킹은 매우 쉽습니다. 비교적 평평하고 올라가는 내내 꽤 좋은 전망을 볼 수 있습니다.""라고 말했습니다. 서울에 가기 전에 호놀룰루에서 샀던 서울에 관한 책에 그렇게 적혀 있었다. 아내와 나는 그 반대가 사실임을 발견했습니다. 나는 택시가 우리를 정상까지 내려준 곳에서 3시간이 걸렸다. 돌이켜보면 맨 아래에 버스 정류장 표시가 있었지만 언제 올지 몰라서 우리는 걷기로 결정했습니다. 3시간 후(7개의 노란색 버스가 우리를 지나고 그곳에서 걸어가는 동안 올라가고 있음) 우리는 아내와 함께 다리가 매우 아프고 화를 내고 도착했습니다. ""합리적으로 평평한""... 나는 그렇게 생각하지 않습니다. 나는 그것을 가파르다고 부를 것입니다. 우리가 마침내 도착했을 때 그것은 멋졌다. 우리는 상위층에 각각 10,000원에 가서 기념사진 액자에 25,000원을 받았어요. 좋았습니다... 타워에서 바라보는 배경을 고를 수 있어요. 불행히도 그날은 매우 흐려서 타워에서 도시의 많은 것을 볼 수 없었습니다. 어쨌든 위로. 흐리지 않으면 장관일 것 같은데.. 날씨가 이랬더니 운이 나빴다. 언젠가는 날씨가 좋을 때 갈 수 있기를 바랍니다! 연인들이 이름이 적힌 자물쇠를 함께 걸고 사진을 찍는 담장을 즐겼는데 아이스크림 매점의 바닐라 셰이크가 맛있었다. 우리는 경치가 좋은 케이블카를 다시 타기로 결정했지만 일단 도착하면 명동 지하철역까지 긴 도보 거리라는 것을 알았습니다. 지도에서 암시하는 것처럼 케이블카 터미널과 같은 위치에 있습니다. 그렇지 않습니다. 케이블카 터미널에서 내려가는 길도 가파르기 때문에 지하철 명동역에서 케이블카 터미널까지 걸어 올라가면 꽤 하이킹이 될 것입니다. 물론 다른 등산로보다는 덜하지만요. 우리가 다시 거기에 간다면 나는 다음 중 하나를 할 것입니다 : 1. 택시가 우리를 내려 준 하이킹 트레일 하단에서 노란색 버스를 기다리십시오 ... 상단에 그가 버스가 단지 W 1,200 또는 그와 비슷한 것이라고 서명 한 것 같습니다. . 또는 2. 택시가 당신을 케이블카 터미널까지 데려다 준다고 주장하고... 택시 기사가 영어를 이해하지 못하는 것 같기 때문에 호텔이나 누군가가 그것을 기사에게 보여주기 위해 한국어로 작성하게 하십시오. 케이블카 요금은 편도와 왕복 요금이 거의 동일하므로 택시를 타고 케이블카 터미널까지 가는 것이 가장 좋은 선택일 것입니다. 그렇지 않으면 하이킹 트레일 바닥에서 노란색 버스를 타십시오. 그 외에 EmmaVestrheim의 리뷰에 대한 다른 모든 관찰에 동의합니다."

We went in the early evening and saw things in daylight and night light. One thing that we didn’t realize was that it’s kind of a romantic place fire couples to go and place a lock with their name on it on the fence. Locks are available to purchase there or bring your own. Food is available there. Anything from grap and go good to sit down resturant. Take the cable car to the base of the tower,720,much,북서울타워는 시내에 가면 꼭 봐야 할 곳입니다. 토론토의 CN Toer나 시애틀의 Space Needle처럼. 당신은 거의 그것을해야합니다. 좋은 경치! 우리는 이른 저녁에 갔고 낮과 밤의 빛에서 사물을 보았습니다. 우리가 미처 깨닫지 못한 한 가지 사실은 연인들이 울타리에 자신의 이름이 적힌 자물쇠를 걸어두는 일종의 낭만적인 장소라는 것이었습니다. 자물쇠는 그곳에서 구입하거나 직접 가져올 수 있습니다. 그곳에서 음식을 드실 수 있습니다. grap에서 무엇이든 좋은 레스토랑에 앉을 수 있습니다. 케이블카를 타고 타워 바닥까지 이동

Forgot how much i paid but i feel that it was more than what the place offers. But we went anywhere...went for a train and a bus ride which was very easy to follow. Still worth a go but again is a little over-rated. And the locks being sold on-site costs between 6500-8500w!!! A little pricey",721,much,우리는 궁전 여행을 마치고 N 서울 타워에 갔다. 나는 그 장소가 과대 평가되었다고 솔직히 말할 수 있습니다. 그들은 커플이 자물쇠를 걸고 자물쇠에 무언가를 쓸 수있는이 영역이 있습니다. 나는 관계가 오래 지속되기를 바랍니다. 내가 얼마를 지불했는지 잊어 버렸지 만 장소가 제공하는 것 이상이라고 생각합니다. 그러나 우리는 어디든 갔다. 여전히 갈 가치가 있지만 다시 약간 과대 평가됩니다. 그리고 현장에서 판매되는 자물쇠는 6500-8500w 사이입니다!!! 조금 비싸다

Ended up, we could not see much of the view and have to constantly get ourselves as near as to the glass and kept wiping the condensed glass. We also felt that the deck was more like a souvenir shop as it was very packed and the walkway was narrow.  Other than that, the line was long too. So there were waiting, lining, waiting and lining. Pretty standard for touristy spot.  Would recommend to just view the skyline at Namsan Park instead. The sunset was good too.",725,much,"우리는 일몰에 가까워지고 있었습니다. 남산공원에서 바라보는 서울의 풍경은 좋았지만 1만원대 전망대에서 바라보는 풍경은 아니었다. 우리는 유리가 더러워져 선명한 시야를 제공하지 못한다고 느꼈습니다. 특히 밤에는 데크 내부의 밝은 빛에 유리가 반사되었습니다. 결국, 우리는 많은 전망을 볼 수 없었고 끊임없이 유리에 가까이 다가가서 응축 유리를 계속 닦아야했습니다. 우리도 데크가 꽉 차고 산책로가 좁아서 기념품 가게 같다는 느낌을 받았다. 그 외에 줄이 너무 길었어요. 그래서 기다리고, 줄을 서고, 기다리고, 줄을 섰습니다. 관광지에 대한 꽤 표준입니다. 대신 남산 공원의 스카이 라인을 보는 것이 좋습니다. 일몰도 좋았다."

Don't expect much from this ride except transportation only. We bought the round ticket. I would recommend only getting a one way ticket. It's quite an easy walk down. It takes about 15-30 mins. There are lots of photo points along the way which the cable car does not offer. Also the wait for the way down was at least 30 mins. It was chaos. We did go up the tower in the elevator. I have to say this part was a waste of money. The views from the first level were amazing. Going up the tower doesn't enhance the view that much. Also it was mayhem in the observation deck. You barely could make it to a window spot and the glass was covered in handprints and smudges. Don't be fooled. The wait for the elevator up was only 15 mins. Coming down was over an hour! Overall tho I would recommend at least going up the cable car. But that's as far as I would go.,748,much,남편과 나는 평일 오후 7 시경 N 서울 타워를 방문했습니다. 우리는 케이블카를 위해 약 30분을 기다렸다. 우리는 정어리처럼 포장되었습니다. 교통편만 제외하고는 이 놀이기구에서 많은 것을 기대하지 마십시오. 우리는 라운드 티켓을 샀다. 편도 티켓만 구입하는 것이 좋습니다. 꽤 쉽게 내려갈 수 있습니다. 15-30분 정도 소요됩니다. 케이블카가 제공하지 않는 길을 따라 많은 포토 포인트가 있습니다. 또한 내려가는 길을 기다리는 시간은 최소 30분이었습니다. 혼돈이었습니다. 우리는 엘리베이터를 타고 타워로 올라갔다. 나는 이 부분이 돈낭비였다고 말하고 싶다. 1층에서의 전망은 훌륭했습니다. 타워에 올라가면 전망이 그다지 좋아지지 않습니다. 역시 전망대에서 난리가 났습니다. 간신히 창가에 갈 수 있었고 유리는 손자국과 얼룩으로 덮여있었습니다. 속지 마세요. 엘리베이터를 기다리는 시간은 단 15분이었습니다. 내려오는데 1시간이 넘게 걸렸다! 전반적으로 적어도 케이블카를 올라가는 것이 좋습니다. 하지만 그것은 내가 갈 것입니다.

It's nice when you go there at night or during sunset I wouldn't really recommend you to go up to the observation deck as there is nothing much to do up there. There are weekly basis performances and benches just below the tower and it is good enough to have to sight when you are climbing up the mountain.

Once at the top of the tower, you can use coin operated viewing binoculars to view the city surroundings. There are also other photo ops in and around the tower are.

There are viewing points as you go up that are great for getting good pictures.  Once at the top, there are many restaurants, a cable car (which we came back down with) and an observation deck costing W10,000 for access. We went up to the viewing deck, but this was inside, with glass splattered with rain drops and light reflecting from the various tourist tat sellers - basically not really worth the money, the time as it didn't give a much better view than what we'd seen already and yielded poor quality photos.  Over all, worth it for the walk up and scenic views, but not for the observation deck!",768,much,"우리는 저녁에 타워까지 걸어갔습니다. 조명이 밝고 아름다운 경치가 좋은 곳이었습니다. 모두 잘 포장되어 하이킹보다 공공 계단을 오르는 것처럼 느껴졌습니다. 올라가다 보면 전망대가 있어 사진을 잘 찍을 수 있다. 정상에 오르면 많은 레스토랑과 케이블카(우리가 다시 내려온 곳)와 10,000원의 입장료를 내야 하는 전망대가 있습니다. 우리는 전망대로 올라갔지만 이곳은 내부에 있었습니다. 유리에 빗방울이 튀고 다양한 관광객 문신 판매자로부터 반사되는 빛이 있었습니다. 기본적으로 돈 가치가 없었습니다. 우리는 이미 보았고 품질이 좋지 않은 사진을 산출했습니다. 전반적으로 도보와 경치 좋은 전망에는 가치가 있지만 전망대에는 가치가 없습니다!"

771,771,115,1324,"Another must-visit in Seoul, a touristy place perhaps, but it's not that bad. I spent less than KRW20000 for a return cable-car ticket, a cup of latte and an ice-cream; and I was done taking photos around the tower in less than an hour. Tips for those who wish not to spend much money there - just power walk to the tower, don't take the cable car :)  The park is very well maintained/kept. The view of Seoul from the outdoor observatory was just breath-taking. The love-locks are pretty to see. There are restaurants/cafes/stalls as well as souvenir shops. At a fee, the observatory in the tower can be visited. It is worth a visit as it's a symbol of Seoul after all.",771,much,"서울에서 꼭 가봐야 할 또 다른 곳, 아마도 관광지일지 모르지만 그렇게 나쁘지는 않습니다. 왕복 케이블카 티켓, 라떼 한 잔, 아이스크림에 2만원 미만을 썼습니다. 그리고 나는 한 시간도 채 안되어 타워 주변에서 사진 촬영을 마쳤습니다. 거기에 많은 돈을 쓰지 않으려는 사람들을 위한 팁 - 타워까지 파워 워킹을 하고, 케이블카를 타지 마세요. :) 공원은 매우 잘 관리되고 있습니다. 야외전망대에서 바라보는 서울의 모습은 그야말로 장관이었다. 사랑의 자물쇠는 보기에 예쁘다. 레스토랑/카페/가판대와 기념품 가게가 있습니다. 유료로 타워에 있는 전망대를 방문할 수 있습니다. 결국 서울의 상징이기 때문에 방문할 가치가 있습니다."

I guess coming here at night would be much better, but I wanted to walk in Nansam Park to get to N Seoul Tower, so I have to do that when there were still light in the sky.  I have been to Tokyo tower and the tower in Shanghai, I am not a big fan of these towers, but I feel bad not visiting them as they are seen as such a big attraction. To me, all three of these towers feel the same. The view isn’t that spectacular either, just a typical city view. So I guess it is worth going if you enjoy the tower view, otherwise, I think it is ok just to take photos from the outside without going to the observatory deck.",777,much,"여름에 5~6시쯤 갔더니 하늘이 아직 밝았습니다. 밤에 오면 더 좋을 것 같지만 N서울타워에 가려면 난삼공원을 걷고 싶었기 때문에 아직 하늘이 밝을 때 걸어야 했다. 나는 도쿄 타워와 상하이의 타워에 가본 적이 있는데, 나는 이러한 타워의 열렬한 팬은 아니지만, 그렇게 큰 매력으로 여겨지기 때문에 그들을 방문하지 않는 것이 아쉽습니다. 나에게 이 3개의 타워는 모두 같은 느낌이다. 전망도 그렇게 화려하지 않고 그냥 전형적인 도시 전망입니다. 그래서 타워뷰가 좋다면 가볼만 하다고 생각하고, 그렇지 않다면 전망대에 가지 않고 그냥 밖에서 사진만 찍어도 괜찮을 것 같아요."
778,778,122,1425,"I was not intended to go to the Seoul Tower. I just made a dinner reversation for a restaurant at 5th floor of the Tower, so I visited the Tower. Before I went there, I read many reviews of other travellers here, and they said you should be ready for long queue for the cable car. So I reached the cable car entrance amost 2 hrs in advance of my dinner booking. Out of my surprise, I did not need to queue at all, I just went there, bought the ticket, then I could go up to the entrance. I waited only for a few minutes, the cable came.  I thought that the cable car would be kind of individual cabinet, but it is not. It is a big one, no seats, able to accomodate 20-25 persons standing inside.  Cable car should be the best way to go to the Tower. I saw many people coming with big tour bus, and they needed to climb up to the hill. Anyway, after I had arrived, I saw many visitors, most of them are mainland Chinese, not very crowded, but noisy.  There are several gift shops and chain restaurants, but nothing special not buy, nor nothing good to eat here. You could take a lot of pictures with the ""love locks"" if you come with your another half.  There, you could buy the ticket to the observatory which is on the 3rd floor. I do not recommend it, though the elevator is interesting. Nothing much to see in the obvservatory. There are very few souvneirs shops, but trust me, the commodities are not interesting to buy though I was ready to, and intended to buy something.  But still, you could have a lunch / dinner at the korean restaurant.  There is also a chained coffee shop, called TWOSOME+, do not go. There is only one staff, so he is always busy and impatient. He might not be good at English, and when I ordered a drink in English, he misunderstood, and gave me another thing, I requested him to exchange, he became even more impatient and the atitudes were bad !  There is a wish pool right next to the coffee shop. I could hardly see something there. Who will throw money into such ""fake"" pool??????  After spending 1 hr on this boring 3rd floor, I went to the destination of this ride - 5th floor - N Grill (french restaurant), which was perfect in service and environment and food.  The view there is wonderful.  I recommend not to go up to this tower, unless you want to spend most time at N Grill. And if you go, it is better to be dinner time. The night view is fantastics.

TWOSOME+라는 체인 커피숍도 있으니 가지마세요. 직원이 한 명뿐이어서 항상 바쁘고 초조합니다. 영어를 잘 못해서 제가 영어로 술을 주문했을 때 잘못 이해해서 다른 걸 줬더니 교환해달라고 했더니 더 초조해 지고 태도가 나빴어요! 커피숍 바로 옆에 위시풀이 있습니다. 나는 거기에서 거의 아무것도 볼 수 없었다. 누가 그런 ""가짜"" 풀에 돈을 던질까요???? 이 지루한 3층에서 1시간을 보낸 후 나는 서비스와 환경, 음식 모두 완벽한 이 놀이기구의 목적지인 5층 N그릴(프랑스 레스토랑)에 갔다. 그곳의 전망은 훌륭합니다. N Grill에서 대부분의 시간을 보내고 싶지 않다면 이 타워에 올라가지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 그리고 가신다면 저녁시간에 드시는게 좋습니다. 야경은 환상적입니다. 그리고 출발하면 낮보다 더 아름다운 밤에 서울타워가 보입니다."

It's a pretty cool attraction, granted, there isn't much to do here (the time we went - early Jan) but the view is nice.  The cable car ride up is fun, and the elevator up to the viewing platform is well thought of - the graphics and concept is a great idea.  There are a few restaurants and cafés around, with a neat little souvenir shop - be sure to purchase a tile, and be part of the tile wall. Also - buy a padlock and join the hundreds of others to lock your love on the gate surrounding the building.  The snow covered city below was an awesome sight, even though it was bitterly cold outside when we were there - it was completely worth it!!  Definitely worth checking out if you're in Seoul.",779,much,우리는 밤에 서울의 불빛을 확인하기 위해 이곳으로 향했는데 실망시키지 않았습니다. 그것은 꽤 멋진 매력입니다. 당연히 여기에서 할 일이 많지 않습니다(우리가 갔던 시간 - 1월 초). 그러나 보기는 좋습니다. 케이블카를 타는 것은 재미있고 전망대까지 올라가는 엘리베이터는 잘 생각되어 있습니다. 그래픽과 개념은 좋은 아이디어입니다. 주변에 식당과 카페가 몇 군데 있으며 깔끔하고 작은 기념품 가게도 있습니다. 타일을 구입하고 타일 벽의 일부가 되어야 합니다. 또한 - 자물쇠를 구입하고 수백 명의 다른 사람들과 함께 건물 주변의 문에 당신의 사랑을 잠그십시오. 우리가 거기에 있었을 때 밖이 몹시 추웠음에도 불구하고 아래의 눈 덮인 도시는 굉장한 광경이었습니다. 그것은 그만한 가치가 있었습니다!! 서울에 있다면 꼭 확인해볼 가치가 있습니다.
780,780,124,1433,"We reached N Seoul Tower by cable car, which happened to be the most exciting part of the visit to the top. It's definitely not the best/coolest tower I've been too, as CN Tower (Toronto, CAN) still ranks in my top 3. I describe it more as a short tower on a big hill. As well, we couldn't see jack from the view as it was extremely hazy.  There were plenty of activities on the plaza as it was kind of touristy. As we were about to leave the first time, they started setting up for a martial show which turned out to be pretty cool. Other than that, I was ready go. Not much to see, overcrowded, and hazy.

So if really go up the Tower also might not be able to see much. Another disappointment is the Teddy Bear Museum is closed during winter. T....T  Tips: remember to bring a marker and padlock for leaving the padlock there with your love wishes. :),784,much,일기 예보를 확인하는 것을 잊었습니다. 명동에서 케이블카 정류장까지 걸어갔다. 정상에 여행 후. 흐린 날임을 알려드립니다. 그래서 정말 타워에 올라가면 많이 볼 수 없을 수도 있습니다. 또 다른 실망은 테디베어 박물관이 겨울에 문을 닫는다는 것입니다.

Restaurants are expensive and even the souvenirs. But what we enjoyed more is the area where people leave locks spreading messages of love especially couples feeling so romantic. You'll see them seated in benches whispering sweet nothings to each other. It was cold and windy that night in September, 2013. Really a good time for couples in love. Another attraction we visited was the Teddy Bear Museum. It was awesome seeing them in all sizes, in different costumes, various themes and some, in action. You really would spend time taking photos not only of these cute bears but photos with them. It was fun. When we were about to leave, there was this light show of the tower itself.

786,786,130,1475,"The North Seoul tower is an excellent way to get good views of the city. We first travelled to Myeong-dong station (line 4 light blue) & exited on #3 which by luck put us right at the transfer bus ( free) up to the cable car ride to the tower. You just have to wait untill the bus is full before it goes. It runs every half our, so just wait if you think you have missed it. It is a green & yellow mini bus. The cable car is one big car that takes about 20-30 people (which is well legal) & it's KRW8000 for a return trip each adult. Once you arrive at the top of the cable car ride it's a reasonable climb ( a million steps according to my missus) to the tower. By going this way there is no disabled access but you can access the Tower by the Seoul City Tour bus if you are getting around in a wheel chair. Once at the Tower there is a variety of things to look at even if you don't want to go up into the viewing platform. There were performers of different sorts, viewing platform, & shaded trees to sit under. The entrance fee to the top of the tower is KRW9000 each for an adult. I thought it was KRW20000 each but when i bought the tickets it was only KRW18000 for both of us-bargain!!!. The ride to the top of the tower is quick & there is a corny video to watch to take your mind of the ride. The view form the tower is quite good but i would suggest being there on a smog free day or you won't have much to look at. Even when we went it was a very nice day but visibility was about 5-10KM. Plenty of trinkets to buy & there is the usual super imposed photo in front of the tower. Quite easy to dodge that one as we didn't speak Korean.You can spend as much time as you like up there & the ride down is as quick as going up. When you're at the bottom of the tower, check out the padlocks of all the gestures of love. Quite impressive really.",786,much,"북쪽 서울 타워는 도시의 좋은 전망을 얻을 수 있는 훌륭한 방법입니다. 우리는 먼저 명동역(4호선 하늘색)으로 이동했고 운 좋게도 타워까지 케이블카를 타고 가는 환승 버스(무료)에서 바로 우리를 3번 출구로 나왔습니다. 버스가 가득 찰 때까지 기다리기만 하면 됩니다. 그것은 우리의 절반마다 실행되므로 놓쳤다고 생각되면 기다리십시오. 초록색 & 노란색 미니버스입니다. 케이블카는 20~30명 정도 탈 수 있는 대형차로(합법적임) 성인 1인당 왕복 8,000원입니다. 케이블카를 타고 정상에 도착하면 타워까지 가는 합리적인 오르막입니다(나의 부인에 따르면 백만 단계). 이쪽으로 가시면 장애인은 없으나 휠체어를 타고 이동하시면 서울시티투어버스를 타고 타워에 오실 수 있습니다. 타워에 도착하면 전망대에 올라가고 싶지 않더라도 다양한 볼거리가 있습니다. 다양한 종류의 공연자, ​​전망대 및 그늘진 나무 아래에 앉을 수 있습니다. 타워 정상 입장료는 성인 1인당 9,000원입니다. 개당 20000원인줄 알았는데 표를 샀을 때 우리 둘 다 18000원에 흥정!!!. 타워 꼭대기까지의 타는 것은 빠르며 타는 것에 대해 마음을 사로잡을 수 있는 진부한 비디오가 있습니다. 타워의 전망은 꽤 좋지만 스모그가없는 날에 거기에있는 것이 좋습니다. 그렇지 않으면 볼 것이별로 없습니다. 우리가 갔을 때도 날씨가 아주 좋은 날이었지만 시야는 5~10KM 정도였다. 구입할 장신구가 많고 타워 앞에서 일반적인 슈퍼 부과 사진이 있습니다. 우리가 한국어를 말하지 않았기 때문에 그것을 피하기가 매우 쉽습니다. 당신은 거기에서 원하는만큼 많은 시간을 보낼 수 있으며 타는 것은 올라가는 것만 큼 빠릅니다. 탑의 바닥에 있을 때 사랑의 모든 제스처의 자물쇠를 확인하십시오. 정말 인상적입니다."
787,787,131,1487,"Come here in the afternoon just before the sunset the views are amazing and the city comes to life! Watch out if the weather is bad you cannot see that much also on Sunday most offices are closed so the city is not as lit up with the buildings as during the week. Its considered to be a romantic spot so you will see a lot of locals having a romantic stroll around the tower. There are also a lot of restaurants around so you can have a diner and watch the city. Two ways getting there: a cable-cart ride which takes about 4-5 minutes or a walk up, which many locals prefer as its free and healthier rather then the cable-cart.

788,788,132,1490,Locks left by lovers hoping to lock their relationship forever filled the railings of N Seoul Tower. Beautiful sight with benches that are bended in the middle. Great place for photo taking. We took the cable car up and visited the teddy bear museum inside as well. Very cute and informative about the history of Korea during the Joseon and Silla era. We were there during Summer and Korea kind of conserves energy a lot so the place is rather stuffy without much air condition and it's really hot and humid. Try to go when it isn't that cloudy. We went all the way up but it was too cloudy to have a good view of the entire city. Beautiful nonetheless. :),788,much,N서울타워의 난간을 영원히 채우고 싶은 연인들이 남긴 자물쇠. 중간에 구부러진 벤치가있는 아름다운 광경. 사진 찍기 좋은 곳. 케이블카를 타고 올라가 안에 있는 테디베어 박물관도 구경했습니다. 조선과 신라 시대의 한국 역사에 대해 매우 귀엽고 유익합니다. 우리는 여름에 거기에 있었고 한국은 에너지를 많이 절약하기 때문에 공기 조건이 많지 않은 곳은 다소 답답하고 정말 덥고 습합니다. 그렇게 흐리지 않을 때 가십시오. 우리는 모든 길을 갔지만 너무 흐려서 도시 전체를 잘 볼 수 없었습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 아름답습니다. :)

The entire location is based around love and romance so really I recommend couples to go here. If its cloudy its not recommended to go atop the tower, as the clouds often hit the top of the tower but not as much the base.

We had lunch first in Myeongdong then walked up going to the cable car. The cable car ride costs KRW6000 for a one-way ticket and KRW8000 for a return ticket. We purchased the one way ticket so we can experience the trail going down the mountain. There was still a bit of a climb going up but there were areas that you can rest, take pictures, buy snacks and enjoy the view.  A major to-do in this site especially for couples is to leave a lock with a love message. You can choose to leave the message in the fence or in metal trees. There really is no rule on how to leave your message -- we saw a lot of curious things attached to the fences such as cellphone cases, lunchboxes, keychains, etc. I already brought a used metal padlock from Manila, but we needed to buy a permanent marker and chose a waterproof bagtag from the souvenir shop to write our message. If you don't have a lock, the souvenir shop sells different colored locks (surely more expensive had you purchased it at your local hardware store).  We bought the bundle package tickets to the Observatory and the Teddy Bear museum (KRW14000/adult). The Teddy Bear museum was a cute way to learn about Seoul's history and the Observatory gives you probably the best panoramic view of Seoul. Near the ticketing area, there's a traditional Korea martial arts demonstration that happens every 3pm. Quite cool to watch.  Going down was a very light hike. This was the same trail you'd take if you will not take the cable car, but judging from the facial expressions of those going up they looked very exhausted halfway up.  The whole experience took about 4 hours to complete, but I'd think some people would probably take much longer if they will choose to eat in the restaurant there.",793,much,"우리는 밤의 불빛이 놀라운 광경이라고 들었지만 우리는 도시의 세부 사항을보기 위해 점심 후에 거기에 가기로 결정했습니다. 우리는 명동에서 먼저 점심을 먹고 케이블카를 타기 위해 걸어 올라갔습니다. 케이블카 이용요금은 편도 6000원, 왕복 8000원입니다. 우리는 산을 내려가는 길을 경험할 수 있도록 편도 티켓을 구입했습니다. 아직 약간의 오르막이 있었지만 쉬고, 사진을 찍고, 간식을 사고, 경치를 즐길 수있는 공간이있었습니다. 이 사이트에서 특히 커플을 위한 주요 할 일은 사랑 메시지가 담긴 자물쇠를 남겨두는 것입니다. 울타리 또는 금속 나무에 메시지를 남기도록 선택할 수 있습니다. 메시지를 남기는 방법에 대한 규칙은 없습니다. 휴대폰 케이스, 도시락 상자, 열쇠 고리 등 울타리에 붙어 있는 신기한 물건을 많이 보았습니다. 마닐라에서 이미 중고 금속 자물쇠를 가져왔지만 우리는 구입해야 했습니다. 영구 마커를 선택하고 기념품 가게에서 방수 가방 태그를 선택하여 메시지를 작성했습니다. 자물쇠가 없으면 기념품 가게에서 다양한 색상의 자물쇠를 판매합니다(현지 철물점에서 구입했다면 확실히 더 비쌌습니다). 우리는 전망대와 테디베어뮤지엄 입장권을 묶음상품권(성인 14000원)으로 구매했다. 테디베어 박물관은 서울의 역사에 대해 배울 수 있는 귀여운 방법이었고 전망대는 아마도 서울 최고의 전경을 제공할 것입니다. 매표소 근처에서 오후 3시마다 열리는 한국 전통 무술 시연이 있습니다. 보기에 아주 시원합니다. 내려가는 것은 매우 가벼운 하이킹이었습니다. 케이블카를 타지 않으면 걷게 될 길과 같았지만, 올라가는 사람들의 표정으로 보아 중도에 지친 모습이었다. 전체 경험은 완료하는 데 약 4시간이 걸렸지만 일부 사람들은 그곳 레스토랑에서 식사를 하기로 선택했다면 훨씬 더 오래 걸릴 것이라고 생각합니다."

800,800,144,1596,"Having been to Tokyo Tower, the N Seoul Tower did not give me the ""wow"" experience when I went up to admire the night scenery. It could be because there wasn't much to look out for when at the top. The view at every angle seemed the same to me. Perhaps it could be better if there was a guide pointing out the landmarks to spot when viewing from a certain part of the tower. The only prominent feature I could identify was probably the Han River.  There are also hourly light shows that will be beamed on the tower itself, starting from 8 pm. But honestly, you can skip it and head straight for the tower. It is nothing fanciful.  The place, like every tourist attraction, is full of people, and waiting time to get up to the viewing gallery can span up to 30 minutes (and that was when I visited on a weekday), so I suggest that you avoid weekends or public holidays, which in my opinion, will take even longer.  TIP: Tower admission fees are 9000 won for adults, but you can enjoy a 10% discount if you use the coupon provided when you purchase a Seoul City Pass Plus (their public transport card, but specially for foreigners) card.

Other than that I do have one more recommendation: Do not miss out on the view from the washroom.

If in Seoul, one could consider going to tick off the list but this one's quite average.",811,much,줄이 너무 많습니다. 간판이 없습니다. 유리가 반사되어 도시의 전망이 명확하지 않았습니다. 근처 시그널서울에서 보는 뷰가 훨씬 좋았습니다. 서울에 있다면 목록을 체크 표시하는 것을 고려할 수 있지만 이것은 평균입니다.
812,812,156,1716,"Well, you gotta do it when in Seoul, right? Trouble is, everyone else had the same idea, so it was 'rammed' at the top.  Terrific view, though, as you'd expect, although the glare from the gift shops reflects a bit too much on the windows at night-time, spoiling photos a little.  I'm glad we went; but it was just ok, and didn't 'wow'-me.",812,much,"글쎄, 당신은 서울에있을 때 그것을해야, 그렇지? 문제는 다른 모든 사람들이 같은 생각을 했기 때문에 맨 위에 '충격을 주었다'는 것입니다. 예상대로 멋진 전망이지만 선물 가게의 눈부신 빛이 야간에 창문에 너무 많이 반사되어 사진을 약간 망칠 수 있습니다. 우리가 가서 기쁩니다. 그러나 그것은 단지 ok이었다. 그리고 나는 '와우'하지 않았다."

815,815,159,1761,"If it is your first time in Seoul and would like to enjoy an aerial view of the city, this is the place to go. I would recommend going there late in the afternoon so you can enjoy the view when there is light until after dark so you get to see the city both during the day and at night. There are several restaurants should you feel hungry and want to eat. There is a convenience store for your basic needs. If you are travelling with very small children and elderly, it may be a challenge walking up the steep hill leading to the tower. There is a portion there where there are trees where you can attach your lock as a remembrance until the next time you visit the tower. The best way to reach the top is by car, if not, bus. Taxi's are not allowed so it's a longer walk by cab. If you go up there during the colder months of the year, bring a jacket, the cold is felt very much at that height.",815,much,서울에 처음 가보고 도시의 공중 전망을 즐기고 싶다면 이곳을 방문하십시오. 낮과 밤 모두 도시를 볼 수 있도록 해가 진 후 어두워질 때까지 경치를 즐길 수 있도록 오후 늦게 가는 것을 추천합니다. 배고프고 먹고 싶은 식당이 몇 군데 있습니다. 기본적인 필요를 위한 편의점이 있습니다. 아주 어린 아이와 노인과 함께 여행하는 경우 타워로 이어지는 가파른 언덕을 걷는 것이 어려울 수 있습니다. 다음에 타워를 방문할 때까지 기념으로 자물쇠를 걸어둘 수 있는 나무가 있는 부분이 있습니다. 정상에 도달하는 가장 좋은 방법은 자동차가 아니라면 버스를 이용하는 것입니다. 택시는 허용되지 않으므로 택시로 더 오래 걸어야 합니다. 일년 중 추운 계절에 거기에 가려면 재킷을 가져 오십시오. 그 높이에서 추위를 매우 많이 느낍니다.

817,817,161,1765,"Went here because I skipped it my past 2 visits to Seoul. It was quite a hike from Myeongdong to the cable car station to bring us up the tower (I forgot how much but around 9000 won roundtrip), but it’s manageable. After getting off the cable car, you can already see colorful “love locks” all over; you can place your own. (If you don’t have a lock they sell it there.) You can also take photos of the Tower from that area. Then there is an option to pay to get up the N tower itself. Since we didn’t want to eat another buffet meal, we only got the tickets with pizza and pasta meal for 2 (not at the top of the tower though), but the pizza especially was superb. At the tower itself, we didn’t need to stay long; 15-20 minutes was more than enough. It was fun to play the interactive booth game though, where you can say hi to people at the Busan tower. :)",817,much,지난 2번의 서울 방문을 건너뛰었기 때문에 여기에 갔습니다. 명동에서 케이블카 정류장까지 타워까지 올라가는 길이 꽤 길었지만(얼마인지는 기억나지 않지만 왕복 9000원 정도) 관리할 만하다. 케이블카에서 내리면 이미 형형색색의 사랑의 자물쇠가 곳곳에 보입니다. 당신은 당신의 자신을 배치 할 수 있습니다. (자물쇠가 없으면 그곳에서 판매합니다.) 그 지역에서 타워의 사진을 찍을 수도 있습니다. 그런 다음 N 타워 자체를 올라가기 위해 지불하는 옵션이 있습니다. 우리는 다른 뷔페 식사를 먹고 싶지 않았기 때문에 2 인분의 피자와 파스타 식사가 포함 된 티켓 만 얻었지만 (타워 꼭대기는 아니지만) 피자는 특히 훌륭했습니다. 타워 자체에서 우리는 오래 머물 필요가 없었습니다. 15~20분이면 충분했다. 그래도 부산타워에서 사람들과 인사를 나눌 수 있는 인터랙티브 부스 게임은 재미있었습니다. :)

However one needs to be careful before going up, since if it is foggy then its a waste as you wont be able to see much. Interesting fact - the tower itself uses lights to indicate whether the visibility is clear or not, so its a good practice to watch for the lights and then make your way there. You can get to the base of the tower for free, which itself is good enough to get a splendid view. But if you want to spend money, you can pay more and make your way up the tower which as a restaurant with a better 360 view. There are two ways to get there - you can trek your way up a nice path or take the bus. The only downside is that it is super crowded, and you need to jostle for space to get a decent view.",818,much,서울 타워는 다른 어떤 곳과도 비교할 수 없는 가장 놀랍고 완벽한 도시의 전경을 제공합니다. 그러나 안개가 자욱하면 많은 것을 볼 수 없으므로 낭비이므로 오르기 전에 조심해야합니다. 흥미로운 사실 ​​- 타워 자체는 가시성이 있는지 여부를 표시하기 위해 조명을 사용하므로 조명을 관찰한 다음 그곳으로 가는 것이 좋습니다. 타워 기슭까지 무료로 갈 수 있어 그 자체로도 멋진 전망을 즐길 수 있습니다. 그러나 돈을 쓰고 싶다면 더 많은 돈을 지불하고 더 나은 360도 전망을 갖춘 레스토랑으로 타워까지 올라갈 수 있습니다. 거기에 가는 방법은 두 가지가 있습니다. 좋은 길을 트레킹하거나 버스를 타는 것입니다. 유일한 단점은 매우 혼잡하고 적절한 전망을 얻으려면 공간을 확보해야한다는 것입니다.
819,819,163,1818,"I've been here twice, once in the evening and once in the day. From the entrance to the tower, you can appreciate the cityscape of Seoul and it's a great view. It doesn't cost much to go up the tower (only 10000 KRW per person, plus there is a bundle of 2 popcorns + 2 beers for 26000 KRW which we availed of). The top of the tower itself was quite small, in terms of circumference. Only housing a candy store and a souvenir shop were located at the main viewing deck, with a non-advertised coffee shop at the lower floor which we would've gone to and stayed at if we had only known (they're the only accessible non-restaurant establishment with seats). It was a great experience but it's more than enough to go up the tower once, no need to do it again and again.",819,much,"나는 저녁에 한 번, 낮에 한 번, 두 번 여기에 왔습니다. 타워 입구에서 서울의 도시 경관을 감상할 수 있으며 멋진 전망을 제공합니다. 타워를 올라가는 데 비용이 많이 들지 않습니다(1인당 10000원에다가 팝콘 2묶음 + 맥주 2병이 우리가 사용한 26000원). 탑 자체의 꼭대기는 둘레가 상당히 작았습니다. 주 전망대에는 사탕 가게와 기념품 가게만 있었고, 지하층에는 광고가 없는 커피숍이 있었고 우리가 알았더라면 갔을 텐데 머물렀을 것입니다. 좌석이 있는 비 레스토랑 시설). 그것은 훌륭한 경험이었습니다. 그러나 타워를 한 번만 올라가도 충분하고 반복해서 할 필요가 없습니다."

Ticket is a little on the pricier side as well, but, the hike up to the N tower was worth it, the view of Seoul from above is just breathtaking",820,much,그토록 기대했지만 결국 너무 실망한 곳 중 하나. 내 기대만큼 매력적이고 멋져 보이지는 않았다. 티켓도 조금 비싼 편이지만 N 타워까지의 하이킹은 그만한 가치가있었습니다. 위에서 내려다 보는 서울의 전망은 아슬 아슬합니다.

Because it was freezing so we gave up walking up the hill all the way to the tower.. we took the cable car instead. The view was spectacular especially during the winter. We brought our own keypad lock because they’re selling for much a higher price at the tower. Overall, the experience was great and we enjoyed it.",821,much,N 서울 타워에 좋은 여행을했습니다. 우리는 신세계몰까지 걸어가다가 좌회전해서 5분정도 걸어가다가 제공된 엘리베이터를 탔습니다. 날씨가 추워서 타워까지 언덕을 걸어가는 것을 포기했습니다.. 대신 케이블카를 탔습니다. 특히 겨울에는 경치가 장관이었습니다. 타워에서 훨씬 더 높은 가격에 판매되고 있기 때문에 우리는 자체 키패드 잠금 장치를 가져 왔습니다. 전반적으로 경험은 훌륭했고 우리는 즐겼습니다.
822,822,166,1889,This area is walking distance from the Myeong-dong area (about 15-20 mins). You then have the option to ride a cable car up or to walk up to the Tower. The cable car is just a few minute ride so we opted to walk. It takes about 30 minutes to walk up (much longer for us as we kept stopping to take pictures of the view!).  We did not enter the tower itself (there is a fee) but we enjoyed the scenery at the top. There are some restaurants at the bottom of the tower.,822,much,이 지역은 명동 지역에서 도보 거리에 있습니다(약 15-20분). 그런 다음 케이블카를 타거나 타워까지 걸어 갈 수있는 옵션이 있습니다. 케이블카는 걸어서 몇 분 거리에 있으므로 걸어서 가기로 했습니다. 걸어서 올라가는 데 약 30분이 걸립니다(우리가 계속해서 멈춰서 경치를 사진에 담기 때문에 훨씬 더 오래 걸립니다!). 우리는 타워 자체에 들어가지 않았지만 (유료) 정상의 경치를 즐겼습니다. 타워 아래에는 레스토랑이 있습니다.
823,823,167,1891,"We booked the tickets to the observatory tower at N Seoul Tower through Klook as its cost around SGD6.50/pax, much cheaper when compared to purchase onsite. If travelling by taxis, you have to stop at the cable car ticket booth and travelled up by cable car or by bus. Its better to reach around 10am to avoid crowd as the queue for cable car can be long. After getting off the cable car, please proceed to B1 of observatory tower to print your ticket using Klook barcode issued to you. We spent less than 30 mins at Observatory Tower as its very small and crowded. I feels this can give a miss. The love-locked area is good enough for you to walk around and take some decent photos of the views.",823,much,우리는 Klook을 통해 N 서울 타워 전망대 티켓을 현장 구매보다 훨씬 저렴한 SGD6.50 / 인으로 예약했습니다. 택시로 오실 경우에는 케이블카 매표소에서 하차하신 후 케이블카나 버스를 이용하여 올라오셔야 합니다. 케이블카의 대기열이 길 수 있으므로 군중을 피하기 위해 오전 10 시경에 도착하는 것이 좋습니다. 케이블카 하차 후 전망대 지하 1층으로 이동하여 발급받은 클룩 바코드로 티켓을 출력하세요. 우리는 매우 작고 혼잡하기 때문에 전망대에서 30 분 미만을 보냈습니다. 나는 이것이 놓칠 수 있다고 느낀다. 사랑의 자물쇠가 있는 지역은 주변을 산책하고 멋진 전망의 사진을 찍기에 충분합니다.
824,824,168,1897,"This tower is pretty much the same as any tower you find throughout your travels. The unique thing about it is around it. Leading up to the tower are hundreds of locks with couples names on them that are locked on the guard railings. There are some restrictions for those putting theirs up and if you don't follow their rules, your lock will be removed at the end of the night. Good view from the tower of the City but like every other tourist stop, a bit over priced. Entrance fee is separate from the cable car ride getting there.",824,much,이 타워는 여행을 하는 동안 찾을 수 있는 타워와 거의 동일합니다. 독특한 점은 주변에 있습니다. 타워까지 이어지는 수백 개의 자물쇠에는 가드 난간에 잠겨 있는 커플 이름이 적힌 수백 개의 자물쇠가 있습니다. 잠그는 사람들에게는 몇 가지 제한 사항이 있으며 규칙을 따르지 않으면 밤이 끝날 때 자물쇠가 제거됩니다. 도시의 타워에서 좋은 전망이지만 다른 모든 관광 명소와 마찬가지로 가격이 조금 비쌉니다. 입장료는 케이블카를 타고 가는 것과 별개입니다.

826,826,170,1925,"Spent the day hiking and visiting the N Seoul Tower.  GETTING THERE Yes, there is a cable car. But the hike is very easy - it's reasonably flat and you get pretty good views all the way up. Once at the tower, you need to buy a ticket to go to the observation deck. There is a shopping mall below, so choose to visit that either before or after the observation deck. Then you join the queue, get your photo taken (optional), and then take the lift to the top. Once at the top, there are three different floors full of restaurants and shops.  Tip: If you have Lonely Planet, they have an excellent self-guided walking tour that's very easy to do. It includes a visit to the Old City Wall.  CROWDS It's *so* crowded. Be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes in queues for food, shops, and finding a spot to take photos.  VIEWS Incredible!  Tip: Want to get good views but be away from crowds? We went to the Hancook restaurant where it was VERY quiet. We then sat there, ate slowly, and watched the sunset from our own table in our own space. It's much better then nudging people out of the way on the main floors.  FOOD First we got beer + chips from a coffee shop, and the chips were laughably bad. Then we went and hid in the Hancook restaurant, which was a little overpriced but nice and quiet. We got our own table overlooking the city.  SOUVENIR SHOPPING Some of the best souvenirs I've seen in Seoul! Did all my shopping there.",826,much,"하이킹과 N 서울 타워를 방문하는 하루를 보냈습니다. 찾아가기 예, 케이블카가 있습니다. 그러나 하이킹은 매우 쉽습니다. 상당히 평평하고 올라가는 내내 꽤 좋은 전망을 볼 수 있습니다. 타워에 도착하면 전망대로 가기 위해서는 표를 사야 합니다. 아래에 쇼핑몰이 있으니 전망대 전후에 쇼핑몰을 선택하세요. 그런 다음 대기열에 합류하여 사진을 찍은 다음(선택 사항) 리프트를 타고 정상으로 올라갑니다. 꼭대기에 오르면 레스토랑과 상점으로 가득 찬 3개의 다른 층이 있습니다. 팁: Lonely Planet이 있다면 아주 쉽게 할 수 있는 훌륭한 셀프 가이드 도보 여행이 있습니다. 구시가지 성벽 방문이 포함되어 있습니다.

Having explored the surroundings under the tower first, I then bought my 10.000 Won ticket and rode the fast lift to the observation deck. The young lady in the lift asked us all to look up to the ceiling of the lift as we started to ascend and the film then took us on a journey much higher than to the top of the Tower - we continued to climb up beyond the earth's atmosphere and into space. Very clever...  At the top I enjoyed stupendous 360° views over the complete city and way beyond. The sky was beautifully clear and you could see for miles and miles. I liked the fact that at one level you could orientate yourself to your home city/country and one level below you could spot the local sights.  The gift shop at the top was well stocked. I really appreciated the chance to buy a postcard or two with the postage stamps already inserted in the envelope. I just needed to buy an extra stamp to cover the postage back to Europe.

The night view was kind of a shame to be honest because it was very foggy so we weren't able to see much of Seoul's skyline. However, the day view was really amazing. Also, Namsan Tower had a lot to offer. I went to the observatory and had the 360 degree view of Seoul. The love locks were great, considering the number of locks that were in there. It was such a shame that I was alone when I came to visit. They also have the hanbok experience which I greatly enjoyed. It's definitely one of the must visit when you're in Seoul.",836,much,"6월 마지막 주에 남산타워에 두 번 갔다. 야경과 낮풍경을 감상하기 위해 야간과 다음날 오후에 방문했습니다. 야경은 안개가 많이 껴서 서울의 스카이라인을 많이 볼 수 없었기 때문에 솔직히 좀 아쉬웠습니다. 그러나, 낮 보기는 정말로 훌륭했다. 남산타워도 볼거리가 많았다. 나는 전망대에 올라 서울을 360도 조망했다. 거기에있는 자물쇠의 수를 고려할 때 사랑의 자물쇠는 훌륭했습니다. 방문할 때 혼자였다는 것이 너무 아쉬웠습니다. 그들은 또한 내가 크게 즐겼던 한복 경험을 가지고 있습니다. 서울에 오면 꼭 방문해야 하는 곳 중 하나입니다."

After Lotte Tower was built, this Tower became even less attractive. If you are really interested, you can go one time. But it is not in the top 20 things to do in Seoul. To make it interesting, do the trekking from Botanical Garden or Dongguk University up the hill to the Tower.  Also crowded on weekends like everything else in Seoul.",837,much,나에게는 너무 많은 사람들이 있습니다. 정상에 올라 그 높은 곳에서 서울을 바라보는 것은 다소 흥미롭다. 그러나 거기에는 할 일이별로 없습니다. 롯데타워가 지어진 후 이 타워의 매력은 더 떨어졌다. 정말 관심 있으신 분들은 한 번쯤 가보시면 좋을 것 같습니다. 하지만 서울에서 해야 할 일 20위 안에는 들지 않습니다. 흥미롭게 하려면 식물원이나 동국대학교에서 언덕을 올라 타워까지 트레킹을 해보세요. 서울의 다른 모든 곳과 마찬가지로 주말에도 붐빕니다.
838,838,182,2116,"I went on a Thursday night on a bus (not many people using the bus which was good) around 8 pm. The evening was humid with some light rain. When I got to the bus terminus by the tower, the sky was still clear enough for some good night view of Seoul. By the time I got up the observation deck of the tower, it was very noisy and crowded with people, with loud music playing in the background, and bright light inside which cast strong reflections on the glass. All these kind of ruined the night view and made the visit very unatmospheric. Then mist set in and everything was shrouded. I stayed for a short time and left. I have visited quite a number of high towers in different cities and many offer great views day and night. This is probably the worst experience I have had so far. I guess it would be much better if I go during the day on a weekday when the weather is fine.",838,much,"나는 목요일 밤에 버스 (좋은 버스를 사용하는 사람이 많지 않음)를 오후 8 시경에갔습니다. 저녁은 약간의 비와 함께 습했습니다. 타워 옆 버스 터미널에 도착했을 때 하늘은 여전히 ​​​​맑아서 서울의 야경이 좋았습니다. 내가 타워의 전망대에 올라섰을 때, 그것은 매우 시끄럽고 사람들로 붐볐고, 배경에는 시끄러운 음악이 흘러나오고, 내부는 유리에 강한 반사를 던지는 밝은 빛이 있었습니다. 이러한 모든 종류의 야경은 망쳐 놓았고 방문을 매우 분위기있게 만들었습니다. 그런 다음 안개가 끼고 모든 것이 가려졌습니다. 잠시 머물다 떠났다. 나는 여러 도시에서 꽤 많은 고층 타워를 방문했으며 많은 타워에서 밤낮으로 멋진 전망을 제공합니다. 이것은 아마도 내가 지금까지 경험한 최악의 경험일 것입니다. 날씨가 좋은 평일 낮에 가면 훨씬 좋을 것 같아요."

The surrounding views are great on their own and doesn’t get that much better that it is worth the money. Besides up top is just a massive tourist trap. There are some shops and stuff at the base of the tower that are neat and a Starbucks for your caffeine fix. So overall would make the trip to it again to see the surrounding area but not the top of the tower.",839,much,타워 주변의 모든 곳에서 보는 전망은 훌륭하고 더 나은 것을 요구할 수 없지만 실제로 타워에 올라갈 필요는 없습니다. 주변 전망은 그 자체로 훌륭하며 돈 가치가 있는 만큼 나아지지 않습니다. 게다가 정상은 거대한 관광객 함정입니다. 타워 바닥에는 깔끔한 상점과 물건이 있으며 카페인을 고칠 수 있는 스타벅스가 있습니다. 따라서 전반적으로 주변 지역을보기 위해 다시 여행을 할 것이지만 타워 꼭대기는 볼 수 없습니다.

Not only do you get amazing views of the city, but you can send postcards all over the world! They provide the postage. Make sure you have enough memory free on your phone - you will be taking a lot of pictures. Also, right before the elevator to the top of the tower, the staff take a picture of you that you can purchase later. Very expensive and not worth it. I saw signs that said no pictures, but everyone was. They sell popcorn like you are going to the movies, like this is an EVENT. Inside the elevator they play a short clip that you watch on the ceiling. At first I didn't understand why, but it makes sense. How awkward would it be to be crammed in a silent elevator with 10 other people trying not to make eye contact? Great for the whole family. Tons of food options too. Also, if you are with your boo, you can leave a lock on the railings like the French used to do on the Pont des Arts bridge in Paris.

But as a tourist, heading up to the tower is just some novelty.",843,much,너무 붐비지 않고 대기열이 길다면 타워 위로 올라갈 가치가 있습니다. 그곳의 도시 풍경은 밤에 좋습니다. 실제로 유리창 없이 아래 공원에서 도시 사진을 찍는 것이 훨씬 더 좋고 선명합니다. 그러나 관광객으로서 타워로 향하는 것은 약간의 진기함에 불과합니다.

We were travelling with my mum who can't walk much. According to multiple taxi drivers, they were not permitted by law to take passengers up. This meant that Mum had to slowly hike up the hill, and mind you it wasn't the easiest of hills to walk up to.  2. Again, mum couldn't walk much. There was no direct access to the top of the tower. Once we reached the hill and boarded the slanted elevator, there were still a series of stairs to climb to finally make it to the entrance of the tower. It was rather handicap-unfriendly.  3. You'd think that after all that climb, the view would be spectacular but it was pretty average. The entrance free to the viewing deck cost KRW10,000 per person and it was indoor. Perhaps I am biased but I thought The Peak in HK was a lot better, must it was outdoor and far more breath-taking.  4. Getting back down was another challenge as you can imagine.

863,863,207,2454,"Suggested time to go up by around 4pm. then go straight on the love lock area and witness the sunset. After the sunset you can go to the park beside the tower and theres a show you can watch... its ideal to go up the tower by around 7pm so you can see the beautiful lights of seoul. Dont forget to buy pop corn and drinks on the ground level (before riding the elevator to tower) its much enjoyable you see the view while eating and chatting with friends. once you are at the top of the tower, dont worry theres a lot of space you can sit on :) Enjoy!!!",863,much,오후 4시쯤 올라가는 것이 좋습니다. 그런 다음 사랑의 자물쇠 지역으로 직진하여 일몰을 목격하십시오. 일몰 후에는 타워 옆에 있는 공원으로 이동하여 쇼를 관람할 수 있습니다. 서울의 아름다운 불빛을 보려면 저녁 7시쯤 타워에 올라가는 것이 가장 좋습니다. 1층에서 팝콘과 음료를 사는 것을 잊지 마세요(엘리베이터를 타고 타워로 가기 전). 식사를 하고 친구들과 담소를 나누면서 경치를 보는 것이 훨씬 즐겁습니다. 타워 꼭대기에 오르면 앉을 수 있는 공간이 많이 있으니 걱정하지 마세요 :) 즐기세요!!!
864,864,208,2460,We go on the night time due to our flight arrived in the afternoon. Plan to catch the sunset but spend too much time looking for our hostel but the view on the night time also stunning. Try the cable car for fast access to the top and video recording along the trip up.,864,much,우리는 비행기가 오후에 도착했기 때문에 밤 시간에 간다. 일몰을 잡을 계획이지만 우리 호스텔을 찾는 데 너무 많은 시간을 할애하지만 밤 시간의 전망도 훌륭합니다. 케이블카를 이용하여 정상에 빠르게 오르고 올라가는 길을 따라 동영상을 촬영해 보세요.
865,865,209,2468,"Seoul tower is a must go tower for tourists because it has a magnificent views of the buildings, places, points of interests and mountains. Went to check it out in Oct, it was great because the weather was good and sunny. We walked slowly up the hill to get on an elevator lift to the tower (free). Then reached mid upper hill had to buy a return ticket (or single one way up or down - can hike up or down the hill) cable ride to the tower. Negative was the staff will filled up the cable car (packed sardines :/) with enough tourists then start the ride. Enjoyed the great views but not really while in the cable car because can't move around to take pictures. When reached the hill top, there were steps to walk up. There was a lock place, where lovers can buy locks to write their wishes and locked it around the fences which was so romantic and a vending machine to sell flowers. After had to walk up few more steps up and there was a Korean dressed up guard standing there and behind 2 more guards were marching each side of the huge big vases (those were for guards to lit those big vases when enemies entered their provinces -old time). Because it was mid autumn festival, there was a stall that let visitors to put on Korean traditional costumes (free) then took pics with the guards. At the tower, visitors able to buy just visit the tower platform, or tickets that include hello kitty museum and comic characters museum. Both museums are small but kids loved them so much. Up to the viewing plateform, the views were magnificent and spent long time to see how Seoul formed. Seoul was surrounded by mountains, palaces were along those mountains, buildings were not tall and able to see the new develop areas and old areas. Slight dissapointed - did not have places to sit and no much service facilities if compared with Lotte world tower (from namsan world tower you can see the Lotte world tower is right opposite to each other). The ladies toilets have glass all the way down in the cubicles but abit smelly and not clean. Overall it was great experience.",865,much,"서울 타워는 건물, 장소, 관심 지점 및 산의 멋진 전망을 가지고 있기 때문에 관광객에게 꼭 가야하는 타워입니다. 10월에 가보니 날씨도 좋고 화창해서 너무 좋았어요. 우리는 타워 (무료)에 엘리베이터 리프트를 타기 위해 언덕을 천천히 걸어갔습니다. 그런 다음 중간 상단 언덕에 도달하면 타워까지 케이블을 타고 돌아 오는 티켓 (또는 위 또는 아래로 편도 - 언덕 위 또는 아래로 하이킹 할 수 있음)을 사야했습니다. 부정적인 점은 직원이 충분한 관광객으로 케이블카 (정어리 포장 :/)를 채운 다음 타기를 시작한다는 것입니다. 멋진 전망을 즐겼지만 사진을 찍기 위해 움직일 수 없기 때문에 케이블카에있는 동안 실제로는 아닙니다. 산꼭대기에 다다르자 올라가는 계단이 있었다. 연인들이 소원을 적을 수 있는 자물쇠를 사서 담을 수 있는 자물쇠 장소와 꽃을 파는 자판기 등 로맨틱한 울타리 주변에 자물쇠를 걸어두는 곳이 있었다. 몇 계단 더 올라가야 했고 거기에 한국인 복장을 한 경비원이 서 있었고 뒤에 두 명의 경비원이 더 큰 큰 화병의 양쪽으로 행진하고있었습니다 (그들은 적이 그들의 지방에 들어올 때 경비원이 그 큰 화병에 불을 붙이기위한 것입니다 -old 시각). 중추절이라 한복을 입고(무료) 경비원들과 사진을 찍을 수 있는 포장마차가 있었다. 타워에서 구입할 수 있는 방문자는 타워 플랫폼을 방문하거나 헬로키티 박물관과 만화 캐릭터 박물관이 포함된 티켓을 구입할 수 있습니다. 두 박물관 모두 작지만 아이들이 너무 좋아했습니다. 전망대까지 올라가는 전망은 웅장했고 서울이 어떻게 형성되었는지 보는 데 오랜 시간이 걸렸다. 서울은 산으로 둘러싸여 있고, 그 산을 따라 궁궐이 있고, 건물이 높지 않아 신개발 지역과 구 지역을 볼 수 있었다. 약간 실망 - 롯데 월드 타워와 비교할 때 앉을 곳이없고 서비스 시설이 많지 않습니다 (남산 월드 타워에서 롯데 월드 타워가 서로 맞은 편에 있음을 알 수 있습니다). 여성용 화장실에는 칸막이에 유리가 있지만 약간 냄새가나고 깨끗하지 않습니다. 전반적으로 훌륭한 경험이었습니다."
866,866,210,2474,"Personally I went at night, the weather was quite cold (October) at first but after walking up so many stairs, I don't feel the cold anymore. Prepare water as there are less water dispenser. Also there are not much place for visitors to rest while walking up the stairs, so brace yourself! It was also crowded when we were there, and we saw a very long line for those who are taking the cable car. But it has many stunning view and quite a number of observation areas we can enjoy while we are on our way to the top. The place with the love locks are beautiful but full of trash, so clean up after yourself after eating there. Wear comfortable shoes as you will climb alot of steep and uneven stairs.",866,much,"개인적으로 밤에 갔는데(10월) 처음에는 날씨가 꽤 추웠는데 계단을 많이 오르니 더 이상 춥지 않습니다. 정수기가 적으니 물을 준비하세요. 또한 계단을 오르면서 쉴 수 있는 공간이 많지 않으니 몸조심하세요! 우리가 갔을 때도 사람이 많았고, 케이블카를 타는 사람들을 위한 줄이 엄청 길었다. 그러나 그것은 우리가 정상에 가는 동안 즐길 수 있는 많은 멋진 전망과 꽤 많은 관찰 지역을 가지고 있습니다. 사랑의 자물쇠가 있는 곳은 아름답지만 쓰레기로 가득 차 있으므로 식사 후에는 스스로 치워야 합니다. 가파르고 고르지 않은 계단을 많이 오를 수 있으므로 편안한 신발을 착용하십시오."
867,867,211,2477,"We went to the N Seoul Tower in October. The line to enter and to buy your ticket is about 90 min, very long line. when you are in the line waiting, along the way you will find some people selling stuff like food and drinks which I think is a very good idea. when you get to the ticket centre the staff there speak English.And the way up is by elevator, before you go on the elevator they show you a short clip but they keep replaying the clip so it becomes boring. when you go up in the elevator when you come out of the elevator,the view comes and there is a candy shop on your right but tits really expensive. overall the view is nice but there isn't much to do other than take pictures. I recommend you going to the N Seoul Tower if you have never been to it, or Korea itself!",867,much,"우리는 10월에 N서울타워에 갔다. 입장하고 표를 사는 줄은 약 90분으로 매우 긴 줄입니다. 당신이 줄을 서서 기다릴 때 길을 따라 음식과 음료와 같은 물건을 파는 사람들을 찾을 수 있습니다. 이것은 아주 좋은 생각입니다. 매표소에 도착하면 직원들이 영어를 구사합니다. 그리고 올라가는 길은 엘리베이터로, 엘리베이터를 타기 전에 짧은 클립을 보여주지만 계속 재생해서 지루해집니다. 엘리베이터에서 내려서 엘리베이터를 타고 올라가면 뷰가 나오고 오른쪽에 사탕가게가 있는데 가슴은 정말 비쌉니다. 전반적으로 전망은 좋지만 사진을 찍는 것 외에는 할 일이별로 없습니다. 한 번도 가본 적 없는 N서울타워나 한국 자체를 추천합니다!"
868,868,212,2480,This tower is not very prominent in Seoul's skyline because of its small size. The actual experience was much better than expected because it makes up for this in views. It seemed like I could even see N. Korea from here. Be prepared for lots and lots of steps if you decide to walk. There are meal/ticket packages that make dining much more reasonable. Be sure to see the free cultural performance outside if you can.,868,much,이 타워는 작은 크기 때문에 서울의 스카이라인에서 그다지 눈에 띄지 않습니다. 실제 경험은 보기에서 이를 보완하기 때문에 예상보다 훨씬 좋았습니다. 이곳에서 북한도 보이는 것 같았다. 걷기로 결정했다면 많은 단계를 준비하십시오. 식사를 훨씬 더 합리적으로 만들어주는 식사/티켓 패키지가 있습니다. 가능하면 야외에서 무료 문화 공연을 관람하세요.
869,869,213,2495,"We visited during the cold season, so it was freezing up there. I've been here twice, but we only did the locks once. Tip: Bring your own locks, much cheaper. :)",869,much,우리는 추운 계절에 방문하여 거기가 꽁꽁 얼었습니다. 나는 여기에 두 번 왔지만 자물쇠는 한 번만했습니다. 팁: 훨씬 저렴하게 자물쇠를 가져오세요. :)
870,870,214,2512,"Not much to do in Seoul, so you can visit a big tower that is bathed in colorful light at night. Nice view from the cable car and from the hill the tower is on.",870,much,서울에서 할 일이 많지 않기 때문에 밤에는 알록달록한 빛으로 물드는 큰 탑을 방문할 수 있습니다. 케이블카와 타워가있는 언덕에서 멋진 전망.
871,871,215,2545,"Lovely Views from the tower at nighttime or evening, go around 7/8pm when the lights are coming on. It's much more romantic. We hung around for it to get dark which was a good choice to make. Would return :)",871,much,야간이나 저녁에 타워에서 아름다운 전망을 감상하고 조명이 켜지는 오후 7시/8시쯤에 가세요. 훨씬 더 낭만적입니다. 우리는 어두워지기 위해 주위를 어슬렁거렸는데 이는 좋은 선택이었습니다. 돌아올 것입니다 :)
872,872,216,2549,"The tower is located at the hill top. We chose to go up the hill by cable car. However, the cable car station is located at a place that not convenient for visitors.  The tower itself is not tall. The entrance fee is expensive as it does not offer much different from the sightseeing spots at the hill top. The day I visited did not have many visitors and made my visit very comfortable. I do not know if they do not have many visitors every day.  There are a lot of restaurants beneath the tower.",872,much,타워는 언덕 꼭대기에 있습니다. 우리는 케이블카를 타고 언덕을 오르기로 했다. 그러나 케이블카 정류장은 방문객에게 편리하지 않은 위치에 있습니다. 타워 자체는 높지 않습니다. 입장료는 언덕 꼭대기에 있는 관광지와 별반 다르지 않아 비싸다. 내가 방문한 날은 방문객이 많지 않아 매우 편안하게 방문했습니다. 매일 손님이 많지는 않은지 모르겠네요. 타워 아래에는 많은 레스토랑이 있습니다.
873,873,217,2562,"This is one of the main landmarks in Seoul, the waiting lines were dredful, line to the cable car, to the elevator ..etc The view to the tower is amazing cuz it's in Namsan park, but to tell the truth it wasn't really that much you can do up there haha",873,much,"이것은 서울의 주요 랜드마크 중 하나입니다. 대기 줄이 어마어마했습니다. 케이블카, 엘리베이터 줄 등 당신이 거기에서 할 수있는만큼 하하"
874,874,218,2563,"The tower its self is great. We much more enjoyed the 2nd level as it was less crowded and you got a nicer view, the 2nd level also had more information unlike the top that just seems to be about getting kids to ask their parents for lollies.  We took the cable car up. They PACK the people in so if you dont rush to a side of the cart you basically cant see anything. The cart ride isnt great so if i was to do it again i would just get the bus up.  Once you get to the base of the tower its then more money to get up. I understand they need to pay for everything but it really does feel like a tourist trap.  The view was great and Id recommend going at sunset so you can start to see Seoul light up and do its thing  Worth going but dont stress if you dont have time",874,much,타워 자체는 훌륭합니다. 덜 붐비고 당신이 더 좋은 보기를 얻었기 때문에 우리는 2층을 훨씬 더 즐겼습니다. 2층에는 또한 아이들이 부모에게 사탕을 달라고 요청하게 하는 것처럼 보이는 상단과 달리 더 많은 정보가 있었습니다. 우리는 케이블카를 타고 올라갔다. 그들은 사람들을 포장하므로 카트의 측면으로 서두르지 않으면 기본적으로 아무것도 볼 수 없습니다. 카트 타기는 좋지 않으므로 다시해야한다면 버스를 탈 것입니다. 일단 타워의 바닥에 도착하면 더 많은 돈을 벌 수 있습니다. 나는 그들이 모든 비용을 지불해야 한다는 것을 이해하지만 그것은 정말로 여행자의 함정처럼 느껴집니다. 보기는 좋았고 일몰에가는 것이 좋습니다. 그러면 서울이 밝아지고 그 일을 할 수 있습니다. 갈 가치가 있지만 시간이 없다면 스트레스를받지 마십시오.
875,875,219,2566,"This was my second attempt at checking out the tower. The first day it was too much smog so I decided not to go up to the top. At the end of the week I tried again and I was so glad that I did. I used the cable cars to gain access which offered great views. At the end of the cable car ride was a performance area, food bar and more views. Then I purchased a ticket to go up to the tower it was nice with more great views, picture opportunities and a gift shop.",875,much,"이것은 타워를 확인하는 두 번째 시도였습니다. 첫날은 스모그가 너무 심해 정상까지는 가지 않기로 했다. 주말에 다시 시도했는데 성공해서 너무 기뻤습니다. 나는 멋진 전망을 제공하는 액세스를 얻기 위해 케이블카를 사용했습니다. 케이블카 타기가 끝나면 공연장, 푸드 바 및 더 많은 전망이 있습니다. 그 다음 나는 더 멋진 전망, 사진 기회 및 선물 가게와 함께 멋졌던 타워에 가기 위해 표를 샀다."
876,876,220,2590,We've been in many towers around the globe and this one probably excited us the least. Though you can have a good view of the city and maybe the sunset timing in a clear sky day would make it much better. There is a free shuttle bus which can bring you there from the nearest subway station to avoid climbing the hill walking. Ask your hotel for information. The cable car cost 8500 and the tower ticket another 10000. Almost 20 USD/pers - maybe a bit too much... Enjoy!,876,much,우리는 전 세계의 많은 타워에 있었고 이것은 아마도 우리를 가장 흥분시켰을 것입니다. 당신은 도시의 좋은 전망을 가질 수 있지만 아마도 맑은 하늘 날의 일몰 시간은 훨씬 더 좋을 것입니다. 언덕을 오르는 것을 피하기 위해 가장 가까운 지하철역에서 무료 셔틀 버스가 있습니다. 정보는 호텔에 문의하십시오. 케이블카 비용은 8500이고 타워 티켓은 또 다른 10000입니다. 거의 20 USD/per - 어쩌면 조금 너무 많은... 즐기십시오!
877,877,221,2607,"I had read that the activities around the tower were fun, so we went up to the tower even though it was raining and overcast. Maybe the activities would be fun for a small child, but I was not entertained. The toy museum and the hello kitty museum just looked kind of pathetic from the outside, so we didn't pay to go in those. The arcade was sad, mostly claw machines (we had already experienced a claw machine arcade and lost several thousand won because the claw jolts too much).",877,much,타워 주변에서 하는 액티비티가 재미있다고 해서 비가 오고 흐려도 타워에 올라갔다. 활동이 어린 아이에게는 재미있을지 모르지만 나는 즐겁지 않았습니다. 장난감 박물관과 헬로키티 박물관은 겉에서 보기에 한심해 보였기 때문에 입장료를 내지 않았습니다. 아케이드는 대부분 클로머신이여서 아쉬웠습니다.
878,878,222,2617,"The view from the top of N Seoul Tower is amazing and the cable car ride up is also stunning! From Myeongdong station, it's not a long walk to the cable car station, though it is all uphill with a decent set of stairs at the end. There is also a shuttle bus from Myeongdong station to the cable car but we just walked. N Seoul Tower should definitely be done at night, when the tower is lit up and so is all of Seoul. One of the most amazing things about the tower is definitely the bathrooms, make sure you pay them a visit before you head back down! We didn't spent long at the top, it's actually a pretty small area, there is a small gift shop and lolly shop, however the gift shop at the base of the tower has a much better range.",878,much,"N서울타워 정상에서 바라보는 경치도 일품이고 케이블카를 타고 올라가는 모습도 멋집니다! 명동역에서 케이블카 정류장까지는 그리 오래 걸리지 않지만 끝에는 괜찮은 계단이 있는 오르막길입니다. 명동역에서 케이블카로 가는 셔틀버스도 있지만 우리는 그냥 걸어갔다. N서울타워는 당연히 밤에 해야 하고, 타워에 불이 켜지면 서울 전체도 마찬가지입니다. 타워에 대한 가장 놀라운 점 중 하나는 확실히 욕실입니다. 다시 내려가기 전에 반드시 화장실을 방문하세요! 우리는 정상에서 오래 시간을 보내지 않았습니다. 실제로 꽤 작은 지역입니다. 작은 선물 가게와 사탕 가게가 있지만 타워 아래에 있는 선물 가게는 훨씬 더 좋은 범위를 가지고 있습니다."
879,879,223,2634,"Our hotel has a shuttle that dropped us off at the cable car so we decided to take that up to the tower. Also because some family members did not wear appropriate shoes... It was earlier in the morning so no line at all. The cable car ride only took about 10 minutes. You're in between trees so the view is just ok. I would have preferred to walk up and recommend it for anyone who is capable and willing.  Walking around underneath the tower, there were some areas with ok views. Unfortunately it was a little smoggy that day so you can't see very clearly for long. We got a couple ice cream cones and sat in the back with tables and panoramic glass window looking towards Gangnam. Unfortunately the would be relaxing experience was many times ruined by people dragging chairs across the concrete that creates the most horrific high pitched sound.  Given the less than ideal visibility, we didn't pay additional to go up to the top of the tower. I think if the weather was better, especially if you have a clear night, that would have been much nicer.",879,much,"우리 호텔에는 케이블카에서 우리를 내려주는 셔틀이 있으므로 우리는 그것을 타워까지 가져 가기로 결정했습니다. 그리고 몇몇 가족들이 신발을 제대로 신지 않아서.. 이른 아침이라 줄은 전혀 서지 않았다. 케이블카를 타는 데 걸리는 시간은 10분 남짓. 당신은 나무 사이에 있으므로보기는 괜찮습니다. 나는 걸어가서 능력과 의지가 있는 사람에게 그것을 추천하는 것을 선호했을 것입니다. 타워 아래를 돌아 다니며 괜찮은 전망을 가진 일부 지역이있었습니다. 불행히도 그날은 약간 스모그가 있어서 오랫동안 선명하게 볼 수 없었습니다. 우리는 몇 개의 아이스크림 콘을 가지고 테이블과 강남을 바라보는 탁 트인 유리창이 있는 뒤쪽에 앉았습니다. 불행히도 가장 끔찍한 고음 소리를 생성하는 콘크리트를 가로 질러 의자를 끄는 사람들로 인해 편안한 경험이 여러 번 망쳤습니다. 시야가 이상적이지 않다는 점을 감안할 때 우리는 타워 꼭대기까지 올라가기 위해 추가 비용을 지불하지 않았습니다. 날씨가 더 좋았더라면, 특히 밤이 맑았더라면 훨씬 더 멋졌을 것 같아요."
880,880,224,2640,I decided to walk up and even tho I was lost 1 hour b4 I found the right path I do not regret this site! I walked from my hotel and it was worth the walk. There is lots of stairs up to where the tower is. You can definitely walk. I am not that athletic but it was ok to walk up. I rested few times. There was a place to take pictures half way up....good place to rest your tired legs. Don't forget to bring water!! When I was up there the tower is....i decided NOT to go up on the tower. Bcuz the wiew was so awesome at where I was that the tower it self was not needed. Ofc for those that want to go up to the tower....its worth it I am sure....but I just sat there on til of that mountain...under the tower and watched ppl and the wiew. That was one of my best moments in Seoul...so lovely! I drank coffee at the cafe and the wiew was like a dream! I warmly recommend this experience! I walked down the mountain too....it was much easier to go down 😊,880,much,나는 걸어가기로 결정했고 1시간 동안 길을 잃었지만 b4 나는 올바른 길을 찾았습니다. 이 사이트를 후회하지 않습니다! 나는 나의 호텔에서 걸었다. 그리고 그것은 걸을 가치가 있었다. 타워가 있는 곳까지 계단이 많이 있습니다. 당신은 확실히 걸을 수 있습니다. 운동을 잘하는 편은 아니지만 걸어서 올라가도 괜찮았어요. 나는 몇 번 쉬었다. 중간에 사진찍을 수 있는 곳이 있었는데....피곤한 다리를 쉴 수 있는 좋은 곳. 물 가져오는거 잊지마세요!! 내가 거기에 있었을 때 타워는 .... 타워에 올라가지 않기로 결정했습니다. Bcuz는 타워 자체가 필요하지 않을 정도로 내가 있었던 곳에서 너무 굉장했습니다. 타워에 올라가고 싶은 사람들을 위한 Ofc....그만한 가치가 있다고 확신합니다....하지만 저는 그냥 그 산까지 거기에 앉아서...타워 아래에서 ppl과 wiew를 보았습니다. 그것은 서울에서 최고의 순간 중 하나였습니다...너무 사랑스럽습니다! 카페에서 커피를 마셨는데 꿈만 같았어요! 나는이 경험을 따뜻하게 추천합니다! 저도 산을 내려왔는데.... 내려오기가 훨씬 수월했어요 😊
881,881,225,2650,"My wife and I went to the Tower in the evening for 2 reasons - eat at the N Grill restaurant on the top floor and see the views. Luckily we had a sunny evening so we were treated to stunning views of the sunset over Seoul. You are very high up and so the views are amazing. I thought the Observatory Deck was pretty much the only attraction but I was really surprised to see that there is actually quite a bit to see and do there with a lot of shops on each floor. So I recommend you allow for about 2 hours of time there. Getting there is very easy, cable car or a bus. If by bus, take the number 2 bus from Chungmuro Station (outside the cinema) and it takes about 20 minutes to the Tower stop. From there it's a five minute walk uphill to the Tower.",881,much,"아내와 나는 두 가지 이유로 저녁에 타워에갔습니다. 최상층에있는 N Grill 레스토랑에서 식사를하고 전망을 봅니다. 운 좋게도 우리는 화창한 저녁을 보냈기 때문에 서울의 일몰의 멋진 전망을 볼 수 있었습니다. 당신은 매우 높아서 전망이 훌륭합니다. 전망대가 거의 유일한 어트랙션인 줄 알았는데, 층마다 정말 볼거리, 즐길거리가 꽤 많고 가게도 많다는 사실에 정말 놀랐습니다. 따라서 약 2시간 정도의 시간을 허용하는 것이 좋습니다. 가는 방법은 케이블카나 버스로 매우 쉽습니다. 버스의 경우 충무로역(영화관 밖)에서 2번 버스를 타고 타워 정류장까지 약 20분 소요됩니다. 거기에서 타워까지 오르막길로 5분이 소요됩니다."

On the way back our guide took us to the park below the tower. They have hundreds of colorful locks with names on them (professing eternal love). And of course we left one (we are told they are periodically removed). A few steps away, we dressed up on the traditional Korean costumes....overall, a very nice experience.",886,much,우리는 아침에 거기에 갔고 맑았음에도 불구하고 약간 흐릿했습니다. .. 그럼에도 불구하고 우리는 전망 (360도)을 매우 즐겼습니다. 돌아오는 길에 가이드는 우리를 타워 아래의 공원으로 데려갔습니다. 그들은 이름이 새겨진 수백 개의 다채로운 자물쇠를 가지고 있습니다(영원한 사랑을 고백함). 그리고 물론 우리는 하나를 남겼습니다(우리는 그것들이 주기적으로 제거된다고 들었습니다). 몇 걸음 떨어져서 우리는 한국의 전통 의상을 입었습니다....전반적으로 아주 좋은 경험이었습니다.

890,890,234,2739,The tower provide a stunning view of Seoul.  But I personally think that it is unnecessary to enter the observation area. You have to pay like KRW 8000 for the entrance. And the view is pretty much the same with view you can get on lower level.,890,much,타워는 서울의 멋진 전망을 제공합니다. 하지만 개인적으로 전망대에 들어갈 필요는 없다고 생각합니다. 입장료는 8000원 정도 내야 합니다. 그리고 보기는 낮은 수준에서 얻을 수 있는 보기와 거의 동일합니다.
891,891,235,2743,"We enjoyed the walk up to the base of the tower. Once at the base, we enjoyed the limited views (due to pollution) and felt that we wouldn't gain much by going up the tower. The entrance fee is overpriced if the view is limited. We got great views a few days earlier from a mountain in bukhansan park. Walk up only took 20 mins.",891,much,우리는 타워 기슭까지의 산책을 즐겼습니다. 일단 기지에 도착했을 때 우리는 제한된 전망(오염으로 인해)을 즐겼고 탑을 올라가도 많은 것을 얻지 못할 것이라고 느꼈습니다. 전망이 제한된 경우 입장료가 비쌉니다. 우리는 며칠 전에 북한산 공원의 산에서 멋진 전망을 얻었습니다. 올라가는데만 20분이 걸렸다.
892,892,236,2748,"This tower beckons us to visit when we sight it from afar in and around Seoul. And visit we did. There is so much to see and do at this tower and its surrounds. We took bus No 5 from Myeongdong. Cars and taxis are no longer allowed past a certain point. So the recourse is to go by bus or cable car. I'm glad we didn't take the cable car for the queue going back down was insanely long. The bus brings you right up to the base of the tower. This tower should be nicknamed Seoul's or Namsan's Love Lock Tower. The variety of, the shapes they form and the insane number of love locks stretch along different walkways are supported by zones - Heart Lock zone, Shiny Love zone, love seats etc. And if you are lucky, you might catch the filming of a love scene like we did!",892,much,"이 타워는 서울 안팎에서 멀리서 보면 꼭 가보고 싶게끔 손짓합니다. 그리고 우리가 한 방문. 이 타워와 그 주변에는 볼 것과 할 것이 너무 많습니다. 우리는 명동에서 5번 버스를 탔다. 자동차와 택시는 더 이상 특정 지점을 지나갈 수 없습니다. 따라서 수단은 버스 또는 케이블카로 이동하는 것입니다. 다시 내려가는 줄이 엄청나게 길기 때문에 케이블카를 타지 않은 것이 기쁩니다. 버스는 당신을 타워의 바닥까지 데려다줍니다. 이 타워는 서울의 또는 남산의 사랑의 자물쇠 타워라는 별명이 있어야합니다. 하트락존, 샤이니러브존, 러브시트 등 다양한 산책로를 따라 펼쳐지는 다양한 모양과 수많은 사랑의 자물쇠는 운이 좋으면 사랑의 촬영 장면을 포착할 수도 있습니다. 우리와 같은 장면!"

The tower in itself is very much typical for these sort of attractions. The first level (5F) is very nice with a good view , some restaurants and shops and plenty of opportunities to take pictures. You will need to pay 10000 KEW to go to the top. It is recommended as there is a nice view. A little expensive for teh offereing. Worth going",894,much,걸어서 케이블카를 타고 내려갔다. 나는 이 길을 추천합니다. 공원에서 멋진 산책을 할 수 있을 것입니다. 특별하지는 않지만 가치가 있습니다. 타워 자체는 이러한 종류의 관광 명소에 매우 일반적입니다. 1층(5F)은 전망이 매우 좋고 레스토랑과 상점이 있으며 사진을 찍을 기회가 많습니다. 정상에 오르려면 10000KEW를 지불해야 합니다. 전망이 좋아서 추천합니다. teh 제공을 위해 조금 비싸다. 갈 가치

It is advisable to go very early during the day if you want to head up to the N Seoul Tower as it can be very crowded. We walked to the ticket office, and the walk up isn't too bad. Waiting time for a ticket is about 30 minutes. Then another 30-45 minutes to the cable car. If you are super fit you can walk up to the N Seoul Tower, otherwise the walk up is not for the faint hearted. When we arrived at the ticket box there was an ambulance collecting someone that had collapsed from the walk. Once you get up to the tower there is a lot to do- shops, eateries, children's activities, marital arts demonstrations and much more. We stayed here for about 3 hours and then walked down. It was about 20 minutes walk down, but you felt sorry for the people walking up, as it is a long walk. This is a must see when in Seoul.",896,much,"이것은 인기있는 관광 명소이므로 사전 계획을 적극 권장합니다. N서울타워에 가려면 매우 혼잡할 수 있으므로 낮에 매우 일찍 가는 것이 좋습니다. 우리는 매표소까지 걸어갔고, 올라가는 것도 나쁘지 않았습니다. 티켓을 기다리는 시간은 약 30분입니다. 그런 다음 케이블카까지 30-45분 더 이동합니다. 당신이 매우 건강하다면 N 서울 타워까지 걸어 갈 수 있습니다. 그렇지 않으면 걸어 올라가는 것은 약한 마음을위한 것이 아닙니다. 매표소에 도착했을 때 구급차가 산보에서 쓰러진 사람을 태우고 있었습니다. 타워에 올라가면 상점, 식당, 어린이 활동, 무술 시연 등이 많이 있습니다. 우리는 약 3 시간 동안 여기에 머물렀다가 내려갔습니다. 걸어서 20분 정도 걸어가야 하는데, 걸어가는 길이 너무 길어서 걸어가는 사람들에게 미안한 마음이 들었다. 이것은 서울에있을 때 꼭보아야합니다."

I went there alone yet still enjoyed myself very much.  Buy ticket to go up to the observatory deck of the N Seoul tower at the base. The staff will guide you through.

898,898,242,2782,"As a tourist my friend and I were told we had to go here and I'm glad we did! The tower offers a variety of attractions and although we never made it inside it just shows how much there is to do. We got to the tower by taking the subway to Seoul station and left through exit 9. We then walked a short distance forward and the shuttle bus stand was there where we took a shuttle bus straight to the park. Other ways include the subway to Myeongdong and a cable car. You can't take a taxi or a car there as they are trying to reduce the pollution to protect the area.  Once at the location you walk up a HILL to get to the actual tower. Wear good shoes guys! There is lots to do there before even paying to get in the tower (which happened to us because of time constraints). There were different dances and sword fighting displays with a running commentary of South Koreas historical background. This is offered in both Korean and English. They include the audience quite a lot which is great fun! I found myself laughing at the comedic side of it!  There is lots to eat ranging from lunch to dessert and snacks so you won't go hungry.  The iconic love locks are also there. For 8000 won you can buy one or 12000 won you can buy a set of two locks, both come with a free marker pen. You then go to write whatever you want and lock it up on the tower forever! Its an amazing thing to do as it feels like you're leaving a part of yourself in Seoul.  This was all done without paying an entrance fee to get into the tower. Unfortunately we never made it inside due to time constraints but that shows there's a lot of fun stuff to do! Definitely visit there, just give yourself a good amount of time.",898,much,"관광객으로서 내 친구와 나는 우리가 여기에 가야한다고 들었고 우리가 해서 기쁩니다! 타워는 다양한 볼거리를 제공하며 우리는 내부에 들어가보지는 않았지만 해야 할 일이 얼마나 많은지 보여줍니다. 서울역에서 지하철을 타고 타워에 도착한 후 9번 출구로 나와 조금 걸어가니 셔틀버스 정류장이 있어서 바로 공원까지 셔틀버스를 탔습니다. 다른 방법으로는 명동행 지하철과 케이블카가 있습니다. 그 지역을 보호하기 위해 오염을 줄이려고 하기 때문에 택시나 자동차를 탈 수 없습니다. 위치에 도착하면 실제 타워에 도착하기 위해 언덕을 올라갑니다. 좋은 신발 신으세요 여러분! 타워에 들어가기 위해 비용을 지불하기 전에 할 일이 많이 있습니다 (시간 제약으로 인해 우리에게 일어났습니다). 한국의 역사적 배경에 대한 해설과 함께 다양한 춤과 칼 싸움이있었습니다. 한국어와 영어로 제공됩니다. 그들은 청중을 상당히 많이 포함하여 큰 재미를 선사합니다! 코믹한 면에서 웃음이 나는 저를 발견했습니다! 점심부터 디저트, 안주까지 먹을거리가 많아 배고프지 않습니다. 상징적인 사랑의 자물쇠도 있습니다. 8000원에 1개를 살 수 있고 12000원에 2개 세트를 살 수 있으며 둘 다 무료 마커 펜과 함께 제공됩니다. 그런 다음 원하는 것을 작성하고 타워에 영원히 가두십시오! 서울에서 자신의 일부를 떠나는 것처럼 느끼기 때문에 놀라운 일입니다. 이 모든 것은 타워에 들어가기 위해 입장료를 내지 않고 이루어졌습니다. 불행히도 우리는 시간 제약으로 인해 내부에 들어가지 못했지만 할 일이 많다는 것을 보여줍니다! 확실히 거기를 방문하십시오. 충분한 시간을 가지십시오."

There's convenience store, some restaurants, popcorn, candies, and well the view. There's garden below or use the cable car to reach the top. Pay some money again for the tower and on the top is kinda small. Comparing with Tokyo skytree or Tokyo tower, they seem to have more to offer.

903,903,247,2855,"I went there with my kids around December 2016. We took the bus there and it was quite tedious to walk up the slope during cold weather. We had a cup of coffee to warm ourselves up before going to the top point of the tower. There are several shops and restaurants there but unfortunately, one of the store owners (located on the first floor) selling accessories and souvenirs was not friendly. Nevertheless, we didn't let this affect our mood. The scenery at the top is so beautiful. It was nice and we bought quite a few souvenirs from the store there. We also visited the Hello Kitty Island located on the first floor which is so adorable. We all love Hello Kitty & Friends. We spent about an hour there taking pictures. My kids enjoy it so much and have been sharing with their daddy (who missed it) since then lol...he is so jealous about it. We will be going there again (and with daddy this time of course)!",903,much,2016년 12월쯤에 아이들과 함께 다녀왔습니다. 버스를 타고 갔는데 추운 날씨에 오르막길을 오르는 것이 상당히 지루했습니다. 우리는 탑의 꼭대기에 가기 전에 몸을 녹이기 위해 커피 한 잔을 마셨습니다. 여러 상점과 레스토랑이 있지만 불행히도 액세서리와 기념품을 판매하는 상점 주인(1층에 위치) 중 한 명이 친절하지 않았습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 우리는 이것이 우리의 기분에 영향을 미치지 않도록 했습니다. 정상에서 바라보는 풍경이 너무 아름답습니다. 그것은 멋졌다. 그리고 우리는 거기의 가게에서 꽤 많은 기념품을 샀다. 너무 사랑스러운 1층에 위치한 헬로키티 아일랜드도 방문했습니다. 우리 모두는 Hello Kitty & Friends를 사랑합니다. 우리는 사진을 찍는 데 약 1 시간을 보냈습니다. 내 아이들은 그것을 너무 즐기고 그 이후로 아빠와 공유하고 있습니다. 우리는 다시 거기에 갈 것입니다 (물론 이번에는 아빠와 함께)!
904,904,248,2866,The tower is easily accessible. If you don't like to walk the cabs and buses can drop you in frunt of cable car. Otherwise there is a scenic walking path. The scenic beauty is due to cherry blossom trees planted all around the tower. I visited in March. Cherry blossom bloom around april. Unfortunately there was not much to see. If you are visiting in winters . Give the place a miss. View is worth it during spring.,904,much,타워에 쉽게 접근할 수 있습니다. 택시와 버스를 걷는 것을 좋아하지 않는다면 케이블카 앞에서 내려줄 수 있습니다. 그렇지 않으면 경치 좋은 산책로가 있습니다. 아름다운 경치는 타워 주변에 심어진 벚나무 때문입니다. 3월에 방문했습니다. 벚꽃은 4월경 만개합니다. 불행히도 볼 것이 많지 않았습니다. 당신이 겨울에 방문하는 경우. 장소를 놓치지 마세요. 봄에는 볼 가치가 있습니다.

Even though the cable car service was quite organized, there was a long line and we had to wait for about half an hour before we could go up. The way up was nice and I got a lot of cool videos and pictures.  We didn't have time to explore the ground floor of the tower (I did see a hello kitty store tho) but Im pretty sure there were a couple of restaurants or cafes down there. We quickly discovered that you also had to pay to actually go up in the tower which was annoying (since we had already payed for the cable car) but it didn't cost that much. We also had to wait in line to get to the elevator, maybe 15 minutes or so. The view is very pretty once you actually get up. You can see the whole city!! Everybody was taking pictures but the windows till didn't get too crowded. There was a candy store and a souvenir shop on the inner side, I didn't buy anything but there was a wide range of different goods. Overall the trip was fun. I've been to Burj Khalifa so it wasn't that mind-blowing for me but you got a cool view :) We decided to walk down but you can obviously also take the cable car. I think our experience would have been much nicer in the summer, when it's warm and the plants are green. I do recommend coming to the tower... but maybe not in the winter.  *visited with my dad*",906,much,케이블카를 타거나 도보로 타워에 올라갈 수 있습니다. 걸어가려고 했는데 마땅한 길을 찾지 못해 케이블카를 탔다. 케이블카 서비스가 꽤 조직적이었음에도 불구하고 줄이 길어서 30분 정도 기다려야 올라갈 수 있었습니다. 올라가는 길은 좋았고 멋진 비디오와 사진을 많이 얻었습니다. 우리는 타워의 1 층을 탐험 할 시간이 없었지만 (나는 헬로 키티 가게를 보았지만) 아래에 두 개의 레스토랑이나 카페가 있다고 확신합니다. 우리는 성가신 (우리가 이미 케이블카 비용을 지불했기 때문에) 타워에 실제로 올라가기 위해 비용을 지불해야했지만 그렇게 많이 들지 않는다는 것을 빨리 발견했습니다. 우리는 또한 엘리베이터에 도착하기 위해 줄을 서서 기다려야 했습니다. 아마도 15분 정도였습니다. 실제로 일어나면 뷰가 너무 예뻐요. 도시 전체를 볼 수 있습니다!! 모두가 사진을 찍고 있었지만 창문이 너무 혼잡하지 않을 때까지. 안쪽에는 사탕가게와 기념품가게가 있었는데 아무것도 사지 않았지만 다양한 상품들이 있었습니다. 전반적으로 여행은 재미있었습니다. 나는 부르즈 칼리파에 가본 적이 있어서 그렇게 인상적이지는 않았지만 멋진 경치를 볼 수 있었습니다. :) 우리는 걸어서 내려가기로 했지만 분명히 케이블카를 탈 수도 있습니다. 나는 우리의 경험이 따뜻하고 식물이 녹색인 여름에 훨씬 더 좋았을 것이라고 생각합니다. 나는 타워에 오는 것을 추천하지만 아마도 겨울에는 아닐 것입니다. *아빠와 함께 방문했습니다*

Second time my friend and I went there during noon time on a weekend so we waited for as long as 2 hours to get to the cable car and everything. Make sure you plan well and avoid the weekends as much as possible if you're planning to visit Namsan Tower. However, day time visit offers a different view and better overall experience so it really depends on what you're looking for.

925,925,269,3160,"Perhaps it was my poor experience at the buffet restaurant (HanCook), the long wait at the Namsan cable car station, or getting ripped off by taxi drivers at the Namsan cable car station taxi stop - that led me to such a poor rating.  N Seoul Tower is one of your typical observation towers among its brethren - e.g. Space Needle, CN Tower, Calgary Tower, etc. And like these other observation towers, they do provide nice views of the city (probably the best time to arrive to these towers is a little before sunset) at a steep cost.  My first annoyance was the shuttle that they provide from Myeondong (line 1) is very confusing. I waited at the stop and the Namsan Cable Car station shuttle came by. My original intention was to take the bus directly to the tower as it was cheaper than the cable car and I heard not so positive reviews of the cable car. The bus driver, who was clearly English deficient or purposely deceitful, told me I was in the correct bus - then promptly dropped me off at the cable car station. I have to imagine that this is a scam, as you then have no other alternative to get to the tower other than using the cable car. The cable car cost is approximately $7.50 USD vs app. $2 USD for the bus ride. So I relented to buy tickets, only to have to wait around 30-45 minutes for a chance to ride the cable car up (be aware of the Disney-like lines which hide the true wait time).  The cable car itself was standing room only. The views going up were a bit disappointing and IMHO not worth the extra $5.50 USD. You can see a nice view of Myeongdong, but you don't get that super wide panoramic view of the other parts of Seoul. The ride is short as well - app. 3 minutes!  I arrived a little after sunset, so that may have tempered my opinion of the place as the views were much more limited at that time. You do have views of various areas of Seoul, as well as an area where people chained these love locks to a fence (similar to a bridge in Seattle), various restaurants, souvenir shops, etc. I didn't realize the Alive Museum is there (I went to the one in Jeju and wasn't too impressed).  We decided to purchase dinner for HanCook restaurant, the buffet restaurant at the tower for approximately $88 USD for two. The only nice thing about this is that the price includes a trip to the top of the tower. I have a separate review of the restaurant, but I can easily summarize the restaurant as terrible. I was able to walk around the tower after dinner - there isn't too much unique to see in the tower itself. We then took a walk around the area at the base of the tower - and again, there isn't much unique to see in terms of shops or restaurant.  We took the cable car back down - the wait was much less. The trip down was uneventful. However, I arrived back at the cable car station base a little after 8:30 PM and unfortunately, the last bus to Myeongdong departs at 8:30 PM! Obviously, the cable car station ticket office doesn't warn you about this. Accordingly, you are left to the wolves - in this case, the taxi drivers. I didn't want to walk back to Myeongdong so I approached a taxi driver for a ride back to Myeongdong. The taxi driver immediately indicated it would cost me a 20000 won rate up front, $17 USD for essentially driving less than a few miles (and actually, Myeongdong is literally only a mile or two away from the Namsan cable car station)! I should have called an UberBlack car at that time instead of taking the taxi... But the lesson is - beware of the Seoul taxi drivers!  Anyway, N Seoul Tower should probably low on your priority list of Seoul attractions as there are many other worthwhile attractions to go to.",925,much,"아마도 뷔페 레스토랑(한쿡)에서의 형편없는 경험, 남산 케이블카 정류장에서의 오랜 기다림, 또는 남산 케이블카 정류장 택시 정류장에서 택시 기사들에게 속아서 - 그것이 나를 그렇게 나쁜 평가로 이끌었습니다. N 서울 타워는 형제들 사이에서 전형적인 전망대 중 하나입니다. 스페이스 니들, CN 타워, 캘거리 타워 등. 그리고 이러한 다른 전망대와 마찬가지로, 그들은 비싼 비용으로 도시의 멋진 전망을 제공합니다(이 타워에 도착하는 가장 좋은 시간은 일몰 전일 것 같습니다). 내 첫 번째 성가심은 명동 (1 호선)에서 제공하는 셔틀이 매우 혼란 스럽습니다. 정류장에서 기다리니 남산케이블카 정류장 셔틀이 왔다. 원래 의도는 버스가 케이블카보다 저렴해서 타워까지 직행하는 것이었고 케이블카에 대한 긍정적 인 리뷰를 듣지 못했습니다. 분명히 영어가 부족하거나 의도적으로 기만적인 버스 기사는 내가 올바른 버스를 탄 것이라고 말한 다음 즉시 케이블카 정류장에서 나를 내려주었습니다. 케이블카를 사용하는 것 외에 타워에 도착할 수 있는 다른 대안이 없기 때문에 이것이 사기라고 생각해야 합니다. 케이블카 비용은 앱에 비해 약 $7.50 USD입니다. 버스를 탈 때 $2 USD. 그래서 나는 표를 사기로 결심했고 케이블카를 탈 기회를 얻기 위해 약 30-45분을 기다려야만 했습니다. 케이블카 자체는 스탠딩 룸이었습니다. 올라가는 전망은 약간 실망스러웠고 IMHO는 추가 $5.50 USD의 가치가 없습니다. 명동의 멋진 전망은 볼 수 있지만 서울의 다른 지역은 그렇게 넓은 파노라마를 볼 수 없습니다. 이동 시간도 짧습니다 - 앱. 3 분! 나는 일몰 후에 조금 도착했는데, 그 당시에는 보기가 훨씬 제한적이었으므로 장소에 대한 나의 의견을 누그러뜨렸을 수 있습니다. 서울의 다양한 지역뿐만 아니라 사람들이 이 사랑의 자물쇠를 울타리에 묶은 지역(시애틀의 다리와 유사), 다양한 레스토랑, 기념품 가게 등을 볼 수 있습니다. 박물관은 살아있다는 것을 깨닫지 못했습니다. (제주에 갔는데 별로 감흥이 없었습니다.) 우리는 타워에 있는 뷔페 레스토랑인 HanCook 레스토랑의 저녁 식사를 2인 기준 약 $88 USD에 구입하기로 결정했습니다. 이것에 대한 유일한 좋은 점은 가격에 타워 꼭대기까지의 여행이 포함되어 있다는 것입니다. 식당에 대한 리뷰가 따로 있지만, 그 식당을 끔찍하다고 쉽게 요약할 수 있습니다. 나는 저녁 식사 후 타워 주변을 걸을 수 있었습니다. 타워 자체에서 볼 수 있는 독특한 것은 많지 않습니다. 그 다음 우리는 타워 기슭에 있는 지역을 산책했습니다. 다시 말하지만 상점이나 레스토랑 측면에서 볼 수 있는 독특한 것은 많지 않습니다. 우리는 케이블카를 다시 탔습니다. 기다림이 훨씬 적었습니다. 아래로의 여행은 사건이 없었습니다. 하지만 8시 30분 조금 넘어서 다시 케이블카 정류장에 도착했는데 아쉽게도 명동행 막차는 8시 30분에 출발! 분명히, 케이블카 역 매표소에서는 이에 대해 경고하지 않습니다. 따라서 당신은 늑대에게 맡겨집니다. 이 경우에는 택시 운전사입니다. 나는 명동으로 돌아가고 싶지 않아 택시 기사에게 가서 명동으로 돌아갔습니다. 택시 기사는 즉시 20000원의 요금이 부과될 것이라고 말했습니다. 본질적으로 몇 마일 미만을 운전하는 데 $17 USD입니다(실제로 명동은 남산 케이블카 역에서 문자 그대로 불과 1-2마일 거리에 있습니다)! 그 때 택시를 타지 않고 UberBlack 차를 불렀어야 했는데... 하지만 교훈은 - 서울 택시 기사들을 조심하세요! 여하튼, N 서울 타워는 가볼 만한 다른 명소가 많기 때문에 서울 명소의 우선 순위 목록에서 낮아야 합니다."
926,926,270,3188,"The N Seoul Tower was an interesting site in that it seemed to offer different people different things. There was an element of fun mixed in to the back drop of the great views of the city plus the trees and nature that is the Namsan Park.  I didn't go up to the observation deck itself. I chose to stick to the viewing platforms around the tower which provided multi level views of different sides of the city.  One of the striking elements would be the love locks that are pretty much every where. A lot of couples come up here and the sheer number of locks is a testament to that. Whilst I came here during the day time you can imagine during sunset and the evening that this would be site for many couples seeking a romantic respite from the city below.  Around the tower itself, aside from the park, are restaurants and cafes that give you the opportunity to just relax and enjoy the environment. For families aside from letting the kids run around for a bit there are fun characters to take photos with.  Whilst I wouldn't necessarily say it's a must see I'd suggest choosing a time of day that meets the objectives of your visit whether it be as a group, family, couple or Individual and just enjoy chill out and enjoy yourself.  Note: I took the cable car up and a bus down. The walk from the metro station to the cable car station is very steep so take it slow walking up or consider getting a taxi if you're with people less mobile.",926,much,"N서울타워는 다양한 사람들에게 다른 것을 제공하는 것처럼 보인다는 점에서 흥미로운 사이트였습니다. 남산공원이라는 나무와 자연과 도시의 멋진 전망을 배경으로 재미의 요소가 뒤섞여 있었습니다. 전망대 자체에는 올라가지 않았습니다. 나는 도시의 다른 면을 다층적으로 볼 수 있는 타워 주변의 전망대를 선택했습니다. 눈에 띄는 요소 중 하나는 거의 모든 곳에서 사랑의 자물쇠가 될 것입니다. 많은 커플이 여기에 오고 수많은 자물쇠가 그 증거입니다. 낮에 이곳에 왔지만 일몰과 저녁에는 이곳이 아래 도시에서 낭만적인 휴식을 원하는 많은 커플을 위한 장소가 될 것이라고 상상할 수 있습니다. 타워 주변에는 공원을 제외하고 주변 환경을 즐기며 휴식을 취할 수 있는 레스토랑과 카페가 있습니다. 아이들이 잠시 뛰어 놀게하는 것 외에도 가족을 위해 사진을 찍을 재미있는 캐릭터가 있습니다. 꼭 보아야 할 곳이라고 말할 수는 없지만 그룹, 가족, 커플 또는 개인으로 방문 목적에 맞는 시간을 선택하고 휴식을 취하고 자신을 즐기십시오. 참고: 나는 케이블카를 타고 내려갔다. 지하철 역에서 케이블카 역까지의 도보는 매우 가파르므로 천천히 걸어 올라가거나 이동성이 적은 사람들과 함께라면 택시를 타는 것을 고려하십시오."

929,929,273,3202,"For a first time visit to Seoul, it would be good to consider the N Seoul Tower as one of your destinations. Of course, there are other similar places such as 63 Building for instance, but N Seoul Tower would be the easiest for a first time visitor.  To get up to N Seoul Tower, you would have to get to the Namsan Cable Car first. The cable car itself is about 15 minutes walk from Myeongdong Station. The cable car will get you up to the top of Namsan Park in about less than 5 minutes. However, be prepared for a wait of about 30 minutes at least during peak hours. Of course, there is the walking option from the bottom if you do not wish to wait that long.  If you wish to take a good shot at sunset or at night, I would say that it is actually better to take it from Namsan Park right outside the N Seoul Tower, rather than at N Seoul Tower itself. As we went during sunset time, it was quite crowded even outside N Seoul Tower itself, but the views are quite amazing even then. I would advise coming early to get a good view.  We went up to N Seoul Tower and found that the views are great, but there is not really too much difference from the views outside N Seoul Tower though. Because of the glass panels at the observation deck, it can be a little difficult to take photos without having reflection in it. It is better to go during the daytime if you wish to go up to the N Seoul Tower in my opinion.  There are a few restaurants serving those who are hungry for a reasonable price, along with a good view of the Seoul skyline as well. Overall, I would say N Seoul Tower would be good to visit once, but there are probably other better places to view the Seoul skyline, perhaps even for free too without the crowds.",929,much,"서울을 처음 방문한다면 N서울타워를 목적지 중 하나로 고려하는 것이 좋을 것입니다. 물론 예를 들어 63빌딩과 같은 다른 유사한 장소도 있지만 처음 방문하는 사람들에게는 N서울타워가 가장 쉬울 것입니다. N서울타워에 가려면 남산케이블카를 먼저 타야 한다. 케이블카 자체는 명동역에서 도보로 약 15분 거리에 있습니다. 케이블카를 타면 약 5분 이내에 남산공원 정상까지 올라갈 수 있습니다. 그러나 최소 피크 시간에는 약 30분 정도 기다려야 합니다. 물론 오래 기다리지 않으려면 바닥에서 걷는 옵션이 있습니다. 해질녘이나 밤에 사진을 잘 찍고 싶다면 N서울타워 자체보다는 N서울타워 바로 바깥 남산공원에서 찍는 것이 오히려 낫다고 말하고 싶다. 일몰 시간에 갔기 때문에 N서울타워 외부에도 사람이 꽤 많았는데, 그때도 뷰는 정말 끝내줬습니다. 좋은 전망을 보려면 일찍 오는 것이 좋습니다. N서울타워에 올라갔더니 전망이 정말 좋은데, N서울타워 밖과 별반 차이가 없다. 전망대의 유리 패널 때문에 반사가 없으면 사진을 찍기가 조금 어려울 수 있습니다. 내 생각에 N서울타워에 오르고 싶다면 낮에 가는 것이 좋다. 서울 스카이라인이 잘 보이는 곳에 합리적인 가격으로 배고픈 사람들을 위한 레스토랑이 몇 군데 있습니다. 전반적으로 N 서울 타워는 한 번 방문하는 것이 좋지만 서울 스카이라인을 보기에 더 좋은 다른 장소가 있을 것입니다. 아마도 군중 없이 무료로라도 마찬가지일 것입니다."
930,930,274,3217,"We are residents in Seoul since 4 years and we went every year more as twice up to the tower. It was a nice green place within a busy town. I remember 3 years ago it was a relaxing walk up and down and also the tower area was quite peaceful. Somehow I have the feeling it is worsening year by year. The operator has started to renovate and offer now several floors with shops, restaurants and whatsoever. Some of them opened and just closed again. LOL. Why? Because probably not many people will spend a penny there. There are mainly interested in making selfies. That's it. And who shall buy all these things you really don't need? We went there and left every time at least 50k for tower entrance and a beer, coffee or ice cream. There were a few shops totally enough to serve visitors. And usually you climb up to have a nice few and not to drink and eat whole day long. Anyway this time is over for us spending any coin there. This year every time we visited the place it was totally over crowded. If you want to visit tower's upper floor you shall wait at least an hour or even more. Especially on the weekends. Same way down. I can be wrong but since 2015 it changed dramatically. We usually walking either up or down along the small road. I remember the time when we saw many people using the bike to go up. Time is over. Now every minute some old diesel engine is rushing uphill to unload and to come back to collect again. Some of them are driving fast and reckless. If you have kids you are mainly busy with watching them because you are afraid that something happened. I really wonder why Seoul citizens are not doing much about it. Did they gave up already? Do they like how it is? This place becomes really disgusting. It has nothing to do anymore with a nice, beautiful, quiet, green, park and place. It just became a polluted place of commerce. We will not visit again. We are done with this tower. Have fun.",930,much,"우리는 4년 동안 서울에 거주하고 있으며 매년 두 번 이상 타워에 올랐습니다. 번화한 도시 안에 있는 멋진 녹지였습니다. 3년 전만 해도 위아래로 한가로운 산책이었고 타워 주변도 꽤 평화로웠던 걸로 기억합니다. 어쩐지 해가 갈수록 심해지는 느낌이 든다. 운영자는 개조를 시작했으며 현재 상점, 레스토랑 등이 있는 여러 층을 제공합니다. 그들 중 일부는 열렸다가 다시 닫혔습니다. ㅋㅋㅋ. 왜요? 아마 많은 사람들이 거기에 한 푼도 쓰지 않을 것이기 때문입니다. 주로 셀카를 만드는 데 관심이 있습니다. 그게 다야 그리고 당신이 정말로 필요로 하지 않는 이 모든 것을 누가 사겠습니까? 우리는 거기에 가서 타워 입구와 맥주, 커피 또는 아이스크림을 위해 매번 최소 50k를 떠났습니다. 손님을 응대하기에 충분한 상점이 몇 개있었습니다. 그리고 보통 당신은 술을 마시지 않고 하루 종일 먹지 않기 위해 올라갑니다. 어쨌든 이 시간은 우리가 거기에서 어떤 코인이라도 쓰는 것입니다. 올해 우리가 방문할 때마다 그곳은 완전히 붐볐습니다. 타워의 고층을 방문하려면 최소 1시간 이상을 기다려야 합니다. 특히 주말에. 같은 방법으로 아래로. 내가 틀릴 수 있지만 2015년 이후로 극적으로 바뀌었습니다. 우리는 보통 작은 길을 따라 오르거나 내려갑니다. 많은 사람들이 자전거를 타고 올라가는 것을 보았을 때를 기억합니다. 시간이 끝났습니다. 이제 매분 오래된 디젤 엔진이 내리막길을 오르막으로 돌진하고 있습니다. 그들 중 일부는 빠르고 무모하게 운전합니다. 자녀가 있는 경우에는 무슨 일이 일어날까 두려우므로 주로 자녀를 지켜보느라 바쁩니다. 왜 서울 시민들은 그것에 대해 별로 하지 않는지 정말 궁금합니다. 그들은 이미 포기 했습니까? 그들은 어떻게 그것을 좋아합니까? 이 곳은 정말 역겨워집니다. 그것은 더 이상 멋지고, 아름답고, 조용하고, 푸르고, 공원과 장소와 아무 관련이 없습니다. 오염된 상가가 되었습니다. 우리는 다시 방문하지 않을 것입니다. 우리는 이 타워를 끝냈습니다. 즐거운 시간 보내세요."
931,931,275,3218,"Useful for getting a feel of the layout of the city, but not much more than that as a foreign visitor. There aren't really any landmarks I was particularly interested in seeing. And it's not even in the top 5 of the tallest towers in the world. The smoggy haze also limited what would be seen.  The best part was seeing Hello Kitty World with my daughter. We were the only ones in there at the time and had a blast being silly, and taking a ton of silly pictures. Coming from the US, Hello Kitty World is a novelty item for us.",931,much,"도시의 레이아웃을 느끼기에 유용하지만 외국인 방문객으로서 그 이상은 아닙니다. 특별히 보고 싶었던 랜드마크는 없었습니다. 그리고 세계에서 가장 높은 탑 5위 안에도 들지 않습니다. 스모그 안개도 보이는 것을 제한했습니다. 가장 좋았던 점은 딸아이와 함께 헬로키티월드를 보는 것이었습니다. 우리는 그 당시에 거기에 있는 유일한 사람이었고, 어리석게 굴고, 어리석은 사진의 톤을 찍는 폭발을 가지고 있었다. 미국에서 온 Hello Kitty World는 우리에게 참신한 아이템입니다."
932,932,276,3221,"We rode the bus to the top...but many people were huffing and puffing their way up the steep and winding road. Once on top, you can walk around a bit to get your bearings, and head over to the ticket counter to buy tickets to the observation deck. The elevator takes you to the top and you can spend as much time as you like taking in the view of a very, very crowded city of skyscrapers. It is hard to believe the amount of people (10 million) who live in the city until you see the vast spread of high rise living. Next, go down a level, that I think is actually better than the top level. Go down to the bottom and spend time looking at all the love locks.....they are EVERYWHERE. We rode the cable car down ..just for the fun of it. Otherwise you can use the steps to get back down to street level or catch the bus.",932,much,"우리는 정상까지 버스를 탔다. ..그러나 많은 사람들이 킁킁거리며 가파르고 구불구불한 길을 오르고 있었다. 정상에 오르면 조금 돌아서 방향을 잡고 매표소로 가서 전망대 티켓을 구입하세요. 엘리베이터를 타고 꼭대기까지 올라가면 매우 혼잡한 고층 빌딩의 도시를 바라보며 원하는 만큼 많은 시간을 보낼 수 있습니다. 고층 생활의 광대 한 확산을보기 전까지는 도시에 살고있는 인구 (천만)의 수를 믿기 어렵습니다. 다음으로, 상위 레벨보다 실제로 더 낫다고 생각되는 레벨로 이동합니다. 바닥으로 내려가서 모든 사랑의 자물쇠를 바라보며 시간을 보내십시오.....그들은 어디에나 있습니다. 우리는 케이블카를 ..그것의 재미를 위해 탔습니다. 그렇지 않으면 계단을 사용하여 거리 수준으로 다시 내려가거나 버스를 탈 수 있습니다."

Beware on return there were some cab drivers who demanded 20000 won because these are the waiting cabs. Don't give in, just wait for those that drop off passengers to this spot. It is a bit much to walk up in the dark narrow road. So take the cable car. Be sure to stand at the windows of the cable car to see the view going or coming down. You have to pay a separate entrance fee to go up the Seoul Tower. The sight up there is just ok, but I guess as a one time visitor you ought to try. The souvenir shop at the top and the lighting inside distract the view towards outside at night. While there, do not miss the locks of love at the foot of the tower. Now that the famous love locks at the bridge in Paris near Notre Dame cathedral had been cut and removed, you should visit this one.",933,much,밤에 스카이라인을 보기 위해 이곳에 왔습니다. 명동에서 케이블카 정류장까지 택시비는 약 4800원이다. 돌아오는 길에는 대기택시라 20000원을 요구하는 기사도 있으니 주의하세요. 포기하지 말고 이 자리에 승객을 내려주는 사람들을 기다리세요. 어둡고 좁은 길을 걸어가기에는 조금 무리가 있습니다. 그러니 케이블카를 타세요. 케이블카 창가에 서서 아래로 내려가는 모습을 확인하세요. 서울타워를 오르기 위해서는 별도의 입장료를 내야 한다. 그곳의 광경은 괜찮지 만 한 번 방문자로 시도해야한다고 생각합니다. 꼭대기에 있는 기념품 가게와 내부의 조명은 밤이 되면 밖을 바라보는 시선을 분산시킨다. 그곳에 있는 동안 탑 기슭에 있는 사랑의 자물쇠를 놓치지 마세요. 노트르담 대성당 근처 파리의 다리에서 유명한 사랑의 자물쇠가 잘려 제거되었으므로 이제 이곳을 방문해야 합니다.
934,934,278,3294,"I went to the Tower and did not expect there to be so much at the top! There were great picture opportunities, many restaurants, and nice places to sit and take in the view.  I made the mistake of not doing my research and going on a Korean national holiday, so it was really crowded. I waited an hour and a half to get to the top, and when I got there the NBurger restaurant had run out of burgers. So, if you can, make sure to go on a weekday when there isn't a holiday.  It was well worth the trip up.",934,much,"나는 타워에 갔고 정상에 이렇게 많은 것이있을 것이라고 기대하지 않았습니다! 멋진 사진을 찍을 수 있는 기회, 많은 레스토랑, 앉아서 경치를 감상할 수 있는 멋진 장소가 있었습니다. 제가 조사를 안하고 한국 공휴일에 가는 실수를 해서 정말 붐볐습니다. 정상에 오르기까지 1시간 30분을 기다렸는데 거기에 도착했을 때 NBurger 레스토랑에는 햄버거가 다 떨어졌습니다. 따라서 가능하면 휴일이 없는 평일에 가십시오. 여행의 가치가 충분했습니다."
935,935,279,3307,This tower gives a great view of seoul but its not much more than that. Take the cable car up to the tower. the plaza surrounding the tower is probably more interesting since they sometimes have shows going on there,935,much,이 타워는 서울의 멋진 전망을 제공하지만 그 이상은 아닙니다. 케이블카를 타고 타워까지 올라갑니다. 타워를 둘러싼 광장은 때때로 거기에서 쇼가 진행되기 때문에 아마도 더 흥미로울 것입니다.
936,936,280,3325,"Take the trolley. You may have to wait but, the walk is brutal. Very nice view you won't get anywhere else. We didn't go up in the tower itself (extra) but, I don't think we missed much.",936,much,트롤리를 가져 가라. 기다려야 할 수도 있지만 걷는 것은 잔인합니다. 다른 곳에서는 볼 수 없는 아주 멋진 전망. 우리는 타워 자체 (추가)에 올라가지 않았지만 많이 놓친 것 같지 않습니다.
937,937,281,3337,Go here at night because the light from the city is splendid. The only thing bringing my rate down from a 5 is that the fact that there is to much background light in the tower which is ruining the photos if you don't press your camera against the window. It would have been nice with an open air platform without a window.,937,much,도시의 빛이 훌륭하기 때문에 밤에 여기로 가십시오. 내 비율을 5에서 낮추는 유일한 것은 타워에 배경 조명이 너무 많아서 카메라를 창문에 대고 누르지 않으면 사진을 망치고 있다는 사실입니다. 창문이 없는 야외 플랫폼이 있으면 좋았을 것입니다.
938,938,282,3340,"Well, we have visited many Sky Towers in different cities in our walk around the world and every time when we come across a new one, we would not hesitate to visit it because the view on the city will be different and will gain unique and wonderful experience.  So in our recent Seoul trip, we decided to visit the N Seoul Tower. It was about past 4.00pm when we arrived and the place was still crowded with visitors mostly foreigners. The viewing point on the ground floor was already awesome and it was built on top on the hill. Along the way, we saw trees with ""LOVE LOCKS"" besides the the mental railings that also have such locks too! It was so colourful and impressive! Unlike the love lock bridges in European cities, mostly located above a river where one would throw the keys into the river after locking it, right here, there is no river but one can throw the keys down the hill! Haha. (you can actually buy a lock in the souvenir shop)  Upon entering the tower via the main entrance, we immediately saw a souvenir and gift shop with a lovely Hello Kitty display at its entrance and no one could withstand the temptation for not taking a photo with it.  Our fullday city tour guide had gone to the ticketing booth to get us the ticket to the top while we were busy taking photos with the Hello Kitty!  Then we took the elevator to the top (according to our guide, the tower was about 250m tall, about 80 storeys if I didn't remember wrongly). While most elevators in other Towers are standard and quite ""boring"" while moving upwards, the ceiling of the elevator here has astonishing moving animations (that depicted moving into the space galaxy) and it was indeed impressive. So everyone in the elevator were kept occupied and so focused on it and forgot the ""time spent"" in getting up there. (anyway, it was quite fast too, think less than a minute)  When we arrived at the top, wow! The view here was spectacular! We walked around 360 degree and really have had a great bird eye's view on Seoul, could see the Gangnam area (South of the Han River), Myeongdong etc. As the sky was still bright, the view was cleared! We really enjoyed the view so much!  There is also a souvenir and gift store right well where you could grab some candies, t-shirts, postcards etc here. Though the place is touristy but they had some promotions and so the items we grabbed here were still reasonable in price.  After our visit here, we took the elevator down to the 1st storey where we had to walk through a ""tunnel"" with LED TVs on both sides featuring Seoul in different times and development phases via computer graphics and animations (on the other side, they also have TV screens that show the history of the country as one walks around). It was very interesting and fascinating and no doubt why Korea is so advance in IT and technology!  Well, if you like heights and good city view from the top of the world, this place will be relevant and good for you. As mentioned earlier, each sky tower is different and offer different and unique views on the city and so it's unfair to compare with one to another. Visit with an open mind and with the feeling to see and experience new and different things, your visit here will be fun, interesting and wonderful!",938,much,"글쎄요, 우리는 전 세계를 걸으면서 여러 도시에 있는 많은 스카이 타워를 방문했으며, 매번 새로운 스카이 타워를 발견할 때마다 주저하지 않고 방문합니다. 경험. 그래서 우리는 최근 서울 여행에서 N 서울 타워를 방문하기로 결정했습니다. 우리가 도착한 시간은 오후 4시가 조금 넘은 시간이었는데도 대부분 외국인 관광객들로 붐볐다. 1층의 전망대는 이미 굉장했고 언덕 꼭대기에 지어졌습니다. 길을 따라 우리는 ""LOVE LOCKS""가 있는 나무를 보았습니다. 정신 난간에도 이러한 잠금 장치가 있습니다! 너무 색다르고 인상적이었어요! 열쇠를 잠그고 강물에 던져 넣는 유럽 도시의 사랑의 자물쇠 다리와 달리 여기 강은 없지만 언덕 아래로 열쇠를 던질 수 있습니다! ㅋ. (실제로는 기념품 가게에서 자물쇠를 살 수 있습니다) 정문을 통해 타워에 들어서자마자 입구에 귀여운 헬로키티가 전시된 기념품과 선물 가게가 있었고 아무도 사진을 찍지 않으려는 유혹을 참을 수 없었습니다. 그것으로. 우리가 헬로키티와 사진을 찍느라 바빴던 동안 우리의 하루 종일 시티 투어 가이드가 매표소로 가서 정상에 오르는 티켓을 얻었습니다! 그런 다음 우리는 엘리베이터를 타고 정상으로 올라갔습니다(우리 가이드에 따르면 타워는 높이가 약 250m, 기억이 잘못되지 않으면 약 80층이었습니다). 다른 타워에 있는 대부분의 엘리베이터는 표준적이고 위로 이동하는 동안 상당히 ""지루""하지만, 여기의 엘리베이터 천장에는 놀라운 움직이는 애니메이션(우주 은하계로 이동하는 것을 묘사함)이 있으며 실제로 인상적이었습니다. 그래서 엘리베이터에 있는 모든 사람들은 계속 바빠서 그것에 집중했고 거기에 올라가는 데 ""소요한 시간""을 잊어버렸습니다. (어쨌든 속도도 꽤 빨라서 1분도 안걸려) 정상에 도착했을 때 우와! 여기의 보기는 훌륭했다! 우리는 360도를 돌아 다니며 서울의 멋진 조감도를 보았습니다. 강남 지역 (한강 남쪽), 명동 등을 볼 수있었습니다. 하늘이 여전히 밝았 기 때문에보기가 맑았습니다! 우리는 보기를 정말로 즐겼다! 사탕, 티셔츠, 엽서 등을 구입할 수 있는 기념품 및 선물 가게도 있습니다. 장소는 touristy지만 그들은 약간의 판촉을 가지고 있었고 그래서 우리가 여기에서 잡았던 품목은 가격면에서 아직도 합리적이었다. 이곳을 방문한 후 우리는 엘리베이터를 타고 1층으로 내려갔고, 양쪽에 LED TV가 있는 ""터널""을 지나 컴퓨터 그래픽과 애니메이션을 통해 다른 시대와 개발 단계의 서울을 보여야 했습니다. 또한 걸어 다닐 때 국가의 역사를 보여주는 TV 화면이 있습니다). 매우 흥미롭고 매혹적이었고 한국이 IT와 기술에서 왜 그렇게 발전했는지 의심의 여지가 없습니다! 글쎄, 당신이 세계 정상에서 높은 곳과 좋은 도시 전망을 좋아한다면, 이곳은 당신과 관련이 있고 좋을 것입니다. 앞서 언급했듯이 스카이 타워마다 도시의 모습이 다르고 독특한 전망을 제공하므로 서로 비교하는 것은 불공평합니다. 열린 마음으로 방문하고 새롭고 다른 것을보고 경험하는 느낌으로 여기를 방문하면 재미있고 흥미롭고 훌륭할 것입니다!"
939,939,283,3355,We prefer night visit as the tower looks amazing with its colourful lightings. There isn't much to see inside the tower except admiring the city of Seoul in 360 deg. Of course you can leave without noticing the Love locks everywhere.,939,much,타워가 화려한 조명으로 멋지게 보이기 때문에 야간 방문을 선호합니다. 타워 내부는 360도 서울 시내를 감상하는 것 외에는 볼 것이 별로 없습니다. 물론 당신은 사랑의 자물쇠를 눈치채지 못한 채 떠날 수 있습니다.
940,940,284,3357,"Going up any tower like this will provide the best views of the city. You can walk up but is a hard climb. Alternatively you can get the cable car up. The prices are moderate, but you can't miss this. There are tours which also take you up, this cost much more.",940,much,이와 같은 타워를 올라가면 도시의 최고의 전망을 제공할 것입니다. 걸을 수는 있지만 오르기 힘들다. 또는 케이블카를 탈 수 있습니다. 가격은 보통이지만 이것을 놓칠 수 없습니다. 당신을 데려가는 여행도 있습니다. 이것은 훨씬 더 비쌉니다.

Not a very fascinating tower with a lot of people fighting to take picture at the window, so not much peaceful place for you to get a peaceful high view from top. Which I believe is the same in most part of the towel in the world. If you do not want to buy a ticket, just walk around the towel at the place where the tourist hang the lock. Is another nice place also, but free. Oh, the towel has transparent toilet....",941,much,"입장권 2개, 맥주 2개, 팝콘이 포함된 26,000원의 입장권을 받았습니다. 그것은 내가 가진 최악의 팝콘이었습니다! 하지만 나머지는 좋았습니다. 많은 사람들이 창가에서 사진을 찍기 위해 싸우는 매우 매혹적인 타워가 아니므로 위에서 평화로운 높은 전망을 얻을 수있는 평화로운 곳이별로 없습니다. 내가 믿는 것은 세계의 대부분의 수건에서 동일합니다. 표를 사지 않으려면 관광객이 자물쇠를 걸어 놓은 곳에서 수건 주위를 걸어 다니십시오. 또 다른 좋은 장소이지만 무료입니다. 아 수건에 변기가 투명하다...."
942,942,286,3377,"Fascinating place to visit. So much more than just the view, which would be worth the visit on it's own. The walk through the park was very peaceful, but very steep in parts. If that is a concern the cable car is a less strenuous way of getting to the top.",942,much,방문하기에 매혹적인 장소. 그 자체로 방문할 가치가 있는 전망 그 이상입니다. 공원을 통한 산책은 매우 평화롭지만 부분적으로는 매우 가파르다. 그것이 우려되는 경우 케이블카는 정상에 도달하는 덜 힘든 방법입니다.
943,943,287,3393,"It is a nice view even from the decks without going up the tower. You can have a beautiful view of Seoul especially when the weather is bright and clear. When we were up there, there was also a performance and also the opportunity to wear Hanbok (traditional Korean attire) for those who are interested. Namsan is the place where people would put their lock of love and leave it there. If you forgot to buy one prior to your visit, there is a souvenir shop which sells those locks and gifts too.I would say you can buy cheaper locks before you get up but I guess the locks up there are fancier. My family and I decided to not go up the tower since it was foggy the day we visit. We figured it wouldn't be worth a visit as we couldn't see much, either. I would strongly recommended to go either at night or on a clear day so that you can get the most out of your visit. A foggy day isn't exactly they best but if that is the only choice you have, just staying at the deck would be enough.",943,much,타워를 오르지 않고 데크에서 바라보는 뷰도 좋다. 특히 날씨가 화창하고 맑은 날에는 서울의 아름다운 전경을 감상할 수 있습니다. 우리가 거기에있을 때 공연도 있었고 관심있는 사람들을 위해 한복을 입을 기회도있었습니다. 남산은 사람들이 사랑의 자물쇠를 넣고 그곳에 두는 곳입니다. 방문하기 전에 하나 사는 것을 잊었다면 그 자물쇠와 선물도 판매하는 기념품 가게가 있습니다. 일어나기 전에 더 저렴한 자물쇠를 살 수 있다고 말하고 싶지만 거기 자물쇠가 더 멋진 것 같아요. 우리 가족은 우리가 방문하는 날 안개가 껴서 타워에 가지 않기로 결정했습니다. 우리도 많이 볼 수 없었기 때문에 방문할 가치가 없다고 생각했습니다. 나는 당신이 당신의 방문을 최대한 활용할 수 있도록 밤이나 맑은 날에 갈 것을 강력히 추천합니다. 안개가 낀 날이 가장 좋은 것은 아니지만 그것이 유일한 선택이라면 갑판에 머무르는 것만으로도 충분할 것입니다.
944,944,288,3394,View is great! Do not expect much in the observatory. Two ways to get to the tower: 1. ride the cable car which is very expensive because you'll be standing with 49 other people 2. use stairs via Namsan Park,944,much,보기는 훌륭합니다! 전망대에서 많은 것을 기대하지 마십시오. 타워에 가는 두 가지 방법: 1. 49명과 함께 서야 하기 때문에 매우 비싼 케이블카를 타십시오. 2. 남산 공원을 통해 계단을 이용

957,957,301,3625,"The N Tower is fun to visit - you can see the panorama of Seoul and even put a little lock with your name on the ""tree-lock"". The way up to the lift is long, windy and arduous - hence, use the inclining lift cabin on the main road - it's much more fun, unless you're into hiking!  There is a shop at the bottom of the cabin which offers all kind of merchandise - don't be tempted, as prices are atrocious and you can get things twice as cheap in the town.  Purchase a return ticket - don't be tempted to purchase a ticket with a meal- and off you go.  There is a lift that could take you up the 5 flights of stairs, but only if you're very old or very pregnant :) - we braved the lift anyway and were told that we have to be ""punished"" by waiting 10 min for such ""disobedience"". The visitors are lined up in a very ""military"" / ""communist regime"" style - you do what you told! - but this is all part of the experience!  Up the top, there are more steps to conquer - then, you're (almost) at the top. The views are great, and there are plenty of opportunities for the photographs and selfies.  There is a concert available on a daily basis , - worth watching for a bit, and there are plants of eateries up the top, although the prices are higher that in downtown Seoul.  In the way back, try to take you place on the bottom right corner of the cable car - that's where you can have the best view as the car descends to the ground.",957,much,"N 타워는 방문하는 것이 재미있습니다. 서울의 파노라마를 볼 수 있고 ""나무 자물쇠""에 자신의 이름이 적힌 작은 자물쇠도 걸 수 있습니다. 리프트까지 가는 길은 길고 바람이 많이 불고 험난합니다. 따라서 주요 도로에서 경사진 리프트 캐빈을 사용하세요. 하이킹을 하지 않는 한 훨씬 더 재미있습니다! 선실 맨 아래에는 모든 종류의 상품을 제공하는 상점이 있습니다. 가격이 끔찍하고 마을에서 두 배나 저렴하게 구입할 수 있으므로 유혹하지 마십시오. 왕복 티켓을 구매하세요 - 식사와 함께 티켓을 구매하려고 하지 마세요. 계단을 5개나 올라갈 수 있는 엘리베이터가 있지만 매우 늙거나 임신한 경우에만 가능합니다. 그러한 ""불순종"". 방문객들은 매우 ""군사적"" / ""공산주의 정권"" 스타일로 줄을 섭니다. 당신이 말한 대로 하십시오! - 그러나 이것은 모두 경험의 일부입니다! 정상에는 정복해야 할 단계가 더 있습니다. 그러면 (거의) 정상에 도달한 것입니다. 전망이 훌륭하고 사진과 셀카를 찍을 기회가 많이 있습니다. 매일 열리는 콘서트가 있으니 한 번 쯤은 볼만한 가치가 있는 곳입니다. 가격은 서울 시내보다 비싸긴 하지만 정상에는 식물을 파는 식당이 있습니다. 돌아오는 길에 케이블카의 오른쪽 하단에 자리를 잡으십시오. 차가 지상으로 내려갈 때 가장 잘 보이는 곳입니다."

I took the Namsan cable car to the tower and the view is beautiful; best time to go is on the afternoon to watch the sunset. This is a place where many couples go to, you would find locks representing their love before going into the tower. They have gift shops and restaurant/cafe inside the tower. Ticket was about $10.00 or 10,000 won per person. There's not much to do unless you are with company and are going to eat in there.",958,much,"나는 집에서 같은 것을 할 수 없기 때문에 경험이 독특하기 때문에 이것은 매우 놀라운 장소입니다. 남산 케이블카를 타고 타워까지 가봤는데 전망이 너무 좋습니다. 가장 좋은 시간은 오후에 일몰을 감상하는 것입니다. 이곳은 많은 커플들이 가는 곳으로 탑에 오르기 전에 사랑을 나타내는 자물쇠를 발견할 수 있습니다. 그들은 타워 내부에 선물 가게와 레스토랑/카페가 있습니다. 티켓은 1인당 약 $10.00 또는 10,000원이었습니다. 당신이 회사와 함께 거기에서 식사를 하려고 하지 않는 한 할 일이 별로 없습니다."

I recommend coming 1 hour before the sun sets so you can see the day and night view at once. Don't come on raining/cloudy days or you won't see much.",959,much,멀리서 보면 여기가 서울타워라는 것을 알 수 있다. 어쩌면 나는 놀라운 전망을 기대했지만 이것은 단지 평균적인 전망입니다. 시간이 없으시다면 많은 것을 놓치신 것이 아닙니다. 이것은 내가 경험을 위해 한 번 올 것이지만 두 번째로 오지 않을 것입니다. 낮과 밤의 경치를 한 번에 볼 수 있도록 해가 지기 1시간 전에 오시는 것을 추천합니다. 비가 오거나 흐린 날에는 오지 마십시오. 그렇지 않으면 많이 볼 수 없습니다.
960,960,304,3698,"Wasn't expecting to catch the cherry blossoms so late in the season. Was 2 week of April. There were at least 7-10 bus loads worth of tourists near the foot of the tower. We had wandered away from the crowds, looking for a good photo opportunity along roads less travelled and threaded upon. Was first our stop in Seoul, was a lovely start to our trip. Seoul little time..... Seoul much to do!!!",960,much,벚꽃이 이렇게 늦게 만개할 줄은 몰랐습니다. 4월 2주였습니다. 타워의 기슭 근처에 관광객의 적어도 7-10개의 버스 로드 가치가 있었다. 우리는 사람들이 덜 다니고 꿰매어진 길을 따라 좋은 사진을 찍을 기회를 찾기 위해 군중을 피해 방황했습니다. 서울에서의 첫 번째 정류장은 우리 여행의 멋진 시작이었습니다. 서울 조금.... 할게 많은 서울!!!
961,961,305,3734,"The view from the Tower is not so different from the base of the tower in my opinion. The glass at the top is not as transparent/too much glare so you can only see when you are right up to the window (whereas I have been to other towers and it's completely clear from wherever you stand). Having said that it's pretty economical to go up (10,000 per person, 21,000 for two people plus a huge popcorn and two drinks!)  Popular couples spot but fun for families and solo travellers as well :)",961,much,"타워에서 바라보는 뷰는 타워의 바닥과 별반 다르지 않다고 생각합니다. 상단의 유리는 투명하지 않거나 눈부심이 너무 커서 창 바로 앞에 있을 때만 볼 수 있습니다. 올라가는 것이 꽤 경제적이라고 합니다(1인 10,000, 2인 21,000 + 대용량 팝콘과 음료수 2잔!)"
962,962,306,3764,Beautiful at night. We did not go up the tower but only went up to the platform to do our locks of love. Even that scenery is nice... much less the one at the top! Go at night for a better view!,962,much,밤에 아름답습니다. 우리는 탑에 올라가지 않고 사랑의 자물쇠를 채우기 위해 플랫폼까지 올라갔습니다. 그 풍경조차 멋지다. .. 정상에 있는 것은 훨씬 덜하다! 더 나은 전망을 위해 밤에 가십시오!

968,968,312,3822,Very long climb and not much to do from the top except take photos and get a nice view of Seoul.  Because of the long climb you can easily spend 3 hours in the area which is better spent elsewhere.  The viewing area is enclosed so not very romantic. The locks area is cool for couples though!  Would just visit this once but there are better places to go.,968,much,매우 긴 등반과 사진을 찍고 서울의 멋진 전망을 얻는 것 외에는 정상에서 할 일이별로 없습니다. 긴 등반 때문에 다른 곳에서 보내는 것이 더 나은 지역에서 쉽게 3시간을 보낼 수 있습니다. 관람 구역이 폐쇄되어 그다지 낭만적이지 않습니다. 잠금 장치 영역은 커플에게 시원합니다! 한 번만 방문하면 더 좋은 곳이 있습니다.

Tower was just fine as there was nothing much to do. View from the top was good and that's all. Get some pictures clicked with a background view and you are done. You can also purchase souvenirs for yourself. We carried out our own lunch so dont have much idea about the food services there. After having our lunch, we visited the alive museum which was right next to the Seoul tower. I would highly recommend you to visit Alive museum if you want to have super fun and planning to visit Seoul tower. Otherwise, visiting seoul tower alone is a complete waste of time in my opinion. Good luck!!! :)",969,much,저는 7월에 서울타워를 방문했습니다. 제 생일이라 서울타워 구경할 때 좋은 할인을 받았어요. 그들은 또한 많은 외국인과 커플 할인을 제공합니다. 타워는 할 일이 별로 없어서 괜찮았습니다. 정상에서의 전망은 좋았고 그게 전부였습니다. 배경 보기로 몇 장의 사진을 클릭하면 완료됩니다. 자신을 위한 기념품을 구입할 수도 있습니다. 우리는 우리 자신의 점심을 먹었으므로 거기의 음식 서비스에 대해 잘 모릅니다. 점심을 먹고 서울타워 바로 옆에 있는 살아있는 박물관을 찾았다. 매우 재미 있고 서울 타워를 방문 할 계획이라면 살아있는 박물관을 방문하는 것이 좋습니다. 그렇지 않으면 혼자 서울 타워를 방문하는 것은 내 생각에 완전히 시간 낭비입니다. 행운을 빕니다!!! :)

It was even difficult to get on a bus from somewhere near Myeongdong to N Seoul Tower. If it were a different day, it would have been better :) That aside, I think NSeoulTower area is an entertaining place, with food places, Bear museum, good view of Seoul and a good place to walk around (be prepared if you want to walk uphill though).",970,much,"우리는 N 서울 타워를 방문하는 시간이 잘못되어 (예정된 불꽃 놀이가 있었기 때문에 장소가 높고 전망이 좋은 곳이 사람들로 가득 찼습니다) 많이 즐기지 못했습니다. 명동 근처에서 N서울타워까지 버스를 타는 것조차 힘들었다. 다른 날이었다면 더 좋았을 텐데 :) 그건 그렇고 NSeoulTower 주변은 먹거리, 곰박물관, 서울 전경, 산책하기 좋은 곳이 있는 재미있는 곳인 것 같아요. 오르막길을 걷는다)."
971,971,315,3841,I was stupid enough to want to walk there. DON'T. The road takes you round and round around the tower instead of straight to it. Just take the bus there it's much easier. You can take the bus to the Tower from meongdong. The tower itself was very expensive. Too expensive. So I didn't bother going up there even though it took me an hour and a half to walk there. The view from the bottom of the tower was already nice so I didn't want to pay 22000 won to go further up for apparently nothing.,971,much,"나는 거기까지 걷고 싶을 정도로 어리석었다. 하지 않다. 길은 당신을 타워로 곧장 가는 대신 빙글빙글 돕게 합니다. 거기에서 버스를 타면 훨씬 쉽습니다. 명동에서 타워까지 버스를 탈 수 있습니다. 타워 자체는 매우 비쌌습니다. 너무 비싼. 그래서 1시간 30분을 걸어가는데도 굳이 올라가지 않았습니다. 타워 아래에서 내려다보는 뷰가 이미 멋있어서 22,000원을 내고 더 올라가고 싶지는 않은 것 같다."
972,972,316,3844,"Well, nothing much to talk about this place..but the scenery was amazing esp at night. I went in Feb this year, decided not to take the cable car and climb up to the top with my own foot(worst decision ever..), i wish someone would carry me, unfortunately..not be able to find one. I don't spend too much time here, 1hr is enough because its too crowded..people everywhere, really hard to find a good spot for me to take a picture(sighed). But still worth a visit.",972,much,"글쎄,이 장소에 대해별로 이야기 할 것이 없습니다. 그러나 밤에는 경치가 훌륭했습니다. 나는 올해 2 월에 갔고 케이블카를 타지 않고 내 발로 정상에 오르기로 결정했습니다 (최악의 결정 ..). 누군가가 나를 데려 갔으면 좋겠다. 불행히도 .. 하나를 찾을 수 없습니다. 나는 여기에서 너무 많은 시간을 보내지 않습니다. 너무 혼잡하기 때문에 1 시간이면 충분합니다. .. 사람들이 도처에 있고 사진을 찍을 좋은 장소를 찾기가 정말 어렵습니다 (한숨). 그러나 여전히 방문할 가치가 있습니다."
973,973,317,3845,"I've been wanting to come here ever since I first saw that cable car scene from My Lovely Sam Soon and was not disappointed! We planned to arrive during sunset and the hotel I was staying is pretty nearby, so we decided to walk on over. The walk up to the cable car station wasn't bad at all, probably because there is this elevator/ramp hybrid thing that helps you up this last steep portion. The cable cars were really cool to ride in although they do kind of pack you in since there are a lot of people.  Once you get to the top you have to climb a few more flights of stairs, which isn't bad, but may be for those with mobility issues. Once you get close to the top you can start to see all the locks of love. There were quite a few vendors selling locks so those looking to lock their love last minute don't have to worry. The view below the tower is really gorgeous although it was a bit windy when we went. There are quite a few restaurants/shops around the bottom of the tower for those who are hungry from the climb.  The tower costs an additional extra to go up to and we bought the package deal in which popcorn/drinks are included. It's funny how they play this scene that you're blasting off to space as you ascend in the elevator. Once you get to the top of the tower, it's pretty much a 360 degree view of Seoul with souvenir shops in the middle. I like how on each window it tells you how far you are from a major city in the world and it's nice to sit down and chill next to a pretty view .  There's not a wholeee lot to do here besides admiring the scenery, but the entire experience was definitely worth it and fun!",973,much,"내 이름은 삼순이에서 케이블카 장면을 처음 본 이후로 여기오고 싶었고 실망하지 않았습니다! 우리는 일몰 시간에 도착할 예정이었고 내가 머물렀던 호텔이 꽤 가까워서 걸어서 가기로 결정했습니다. 케이블카 역까지의 도보는 전혀 나쁘지 않았습니다. 아마도 이 마지막 가파른 부분을 올라가는 데 도움이 되는 이 엘리베이터/램프 하이브리드가 있기 때문일 것입니다. 케이블카는 사람들이 많기 때문에 일종의 포장을하지만 타기에 정말 시원했습니다. 정상에 오르면 몇 층 더 계단을 올라야 하는데, 나쁘지는 않지만 거동이 불편한 사람들을 위한 것일 수 있습니다. 정상에 가까워지면 사랑의 자물쇠가 모두 보이기 시작할 수 있습니다. 자물쇠를 판매하는 상인이 꽤 많았으므로 마지막 순간에 사랑을 잠그려는 사람들은 걱정할 필요가 없습니다. 우리가 갔을 때 바람이 조금 불었지만 타워 아래의 전망은 정말 화려합니다. 등반에서 배고픈 사람들을 위해 타워 바닥 주위에 꽤 많은 레스토랑/상점이 있습니다. 타워는 올라가는 데 추가 비용이 들며 우리는 팝콘/음료가 포함된 패키지 거래를 샀습니다. 엘리베이터를 타고 올라갈 때 우주로 날아가는 이 장면을 그들이 어떻게 연기하는지 재미있습니다. 타워 꼭대기에 오르면 중간에 기념품 가게가 있는 서울의 거의 360도 전망을 볼 수 있습니다. 나는 각 창에서 당신이 세계의 주요 도시에서 얼마나 멀리 떨어져 있는지 알려주는 방식을 좋아하고 아름다운 전망 옆에 앉아서 차가워지는 것이 좋습니다. 경치를 감상하는 것 외에는 여기에서 할 일이 많지 않지만 전체 경험은 확실히 가치 있고 재미있었습니다!"
974,974,318,3847,"Twice I've been there during winter. I love walking up the slope and looking at the scenery and how the trees cast shadows on the path. I'm not sure how it'll feel for summer though. The wind can be a little too much for winter and high altitude. I think u have to go up the tower itself so that you won't get blown away. Same, I think scenery up the tower is best when you go just before sunset so that you can enjoy 2 different feel.",974,much,나는 겨울 동안 두 번 거기에 갔다. 나는 비탈길을 걷고 풍경과 나무들이 길에 그림자를 드리우는 것을 보는 것을 좋아합니다. 여름엔 어떨지 모르겠지만. 바람은 겨울과 높은 고도에 약간 너무 많을 수 있습니다. 나는 당신이 날아 가지 않도록 타워 자체로 올라가야한다고 생각합니다. 마찬가지로 타워에 오르는 풍경은 해가지기 직전에 갈 때가 가장 좋은 것 같아서 두 가지 다른 느낌을 즐길 수 있습니다.
975,975,319,3855,"Hit the cable car walk round the summit once then bail.  Amazing views, inexpensive with a sweet cable ride in & out.  Highlights: views Lowlights: not much education as to why it exists.",975,much,"케이블카를 타고 정상 주변을 한 번 돌았다가 탈출하세요. 놀라운 전망, 저렴한 케이블 인 & 아웃으로 저렴합니다. 하이라이트: 보기 낮은 것: 그것이 존재하는 이유에 대한 교육이 많지 않습니다."
976,976,320,3873,This attraction isn't the cheapest in Seoul but it's definitely good if you want great views of Seoul. The first time I went it was foggy and I couldn't really see much so they give me a ticket to go back. This was good for me because I was in Korea for a year but not so good if you are only there for a short period of time. So it's definitely worth checking the weather before going. I've been both day and night time. During the day it's a nice walk through Namsan Park up to the tower and there was different games and activities going on outside of the tower. On the night time the tower is lit up and the views from the top were amazing! So it really just depends what you want to see. I've walked up and took the cable car. The walk was nice but can take a while so again it depends if you like the walk or just want to see the tower. The restaurant in the tower is nice and you can get a combo ticket for a meal and entry but it is also very expensive. There's a gift shop in the tower also.,976,much,이 명소는 서울에서 가장 저렴하지는 않지만 서울의 멋진 전망을 원한다면 확실히 좋습니다. 처음 갔을 땐 안개가 자욱해서 잘 보이지 않아서 다시 갈 수 있는 티켓을 주셨어요. 1년 동안 한국에 있었기 때문에 이것은 나에게 좋았지만 짧은 기간 동안만 거기에 있다면 그다지 좋지 않았습니다. 따라서 가기 전에 날씨를 확인하는 것이 좋습니다. 저는 낮과 밤을 모두 보냈습니다. 낮에는 남산 공원을 지나 타워까지 걸어가는 것이 좋으며 타워 밖에서 다양한 게임과 활동이 진행되고 있습니다. 밤 시간에는 타워에 조명이 켜지고 정상에서 보는 전망은 훌륭했습니다! 그래서 그것은 당신이보고 싶은 것에 달려 있습니다. 걸어서 올라가서 케이블카를 탔습니다. 산책은 좋았지 만 시간이 걸릴 수 있으므로 산책을 좋아하는지 아니면 타워를보고 싶은지에 따라 다릅니다. 타워의 레스토랑은 훌륭하고 식사와 입장을 위한 콤보 티켓을 얻을 수 있지만 또한 매우 비쌉니다. 타워에는 선물 가게도 있습니다.
977,977,321,3875,"Seoul tower was amazing! The views were great and there was so much to do inside the tower like take fun pictures, eat and of course shop! The hike to the tower was fun although tiring for those not in the best shape, but worth it!",977,much,"서울 타워는 훌륭했습니다! 보기는 훌륭했고 재미있는 사진을 찍고, 먹고, 물론 쇼핑하는 것과 같이 타워 내부에서 할 일이 너무 많았습니다! 탑까지의 하이킹은 비록 최상의 상태는 아니지만 그만한 가치가 있는 사람들에게는 피곤하지만 재미있었습니다!"
978,978,322,3879,We didn't feel much great here. Its like normal mountain where you can find city view. Its not unique things for sure. I think its suitable for couples.,978,much,우리는 여기에서 크게 느끼지 못했습니다. 도시 전망을 볼 수있는 일반 산과 같습니다. 확실히 독특한 것은 아닙니다. 커플들에게 딱인 것 같아요.
979,979,323,3885,"The views were good and the facilities - restrooms, eating/dining were good and there's a plaza that is currently being constructed. I enjoyed the view from the top - however it wasn't that much better than the view from the hill, so I'm not sure it justified the price tag!",979,much,"전망도 좋았고 시설 - 화장실, 식사 / 식사도 좋았고 현재 건설중인 광장이 있습니다. 나는 정상에서의 전망을 즐겼습니다 - 그러나 그것은 언덕에서 보는 것보다 훨씬 좋지 않았기 때문에 가격표를 정당화했는지 확실하지 않습니다!"
980,980,324,3892,I once visited this place with my father and siblings. Being here was so pleasant and fun. Me and my siblings had so much fun. This place reminds me of the time I had with my family.,980,much,나는 한때 아버지와 형제 자매와 함께 이곳을 방문했습니다. 여기에 있는 것이 너무 즐겁고 재미있었습니다. 나와 내 형제들은 너무 재미있었다. 이 곳은 내가 가족과 함께 했던 시간을 생각나게 합니다.
981,981,325,3908,"We decided to take the cable car up and walk down. This was indeed the correct decision. If you decide to walk up be prepared for a tough climb. There was a 30 minute queue for the cable car and we were jammed into the car like sardines, but still it got us up to the tower OK and without breaking a sweat.  At the tower we were a bit confused about which ticket to buy. There was the observation tower and a combined Tower and Pavilion ticket, but it was not clear what the Pavilion actually was. Finally we bought a beer package which was access to the observation tower for 2 persons and a beer each for 26,000 in total. Not bad considering the tower alone would have been 20,000. cheapest beer we had in Seoul ha ha. You need to collect your beer though before you take the elevator to the top.  The views are pretty average. Its not like the Eiffel tower where you are looking down on so many historic places. Here you pretty much just see a concrete jungle.  When we came down we bought a lock and wrote our message on it and hung it on the fence. Kind of quirky but we enjoyed it. Finally we walked down to the bottom which is very enjoyable and recommended.",981,much,"우리는 케이블카를 타고 내려오기로 했다. 이것은 참으로 올바른 결정이었습니다. 당신이 걷기로 결정했다면 힘든 등반을 준비하십시오. 케이블카는 30분 정도 줄을 서서 정어리처럼 차에 갇혔지만 그래도 땀을 흘리지 않고 타워까지 OK였습니다. 타워에서 우리는 어떤 표를 사야 할지 약간 혼란스러웠습니다. 전망대와 타워와 파빌리온을 합친 입장권이 있었지만, 실제로 파빌리온이 무엇인지는 알 수 없었다. 마지막으로 우리는 2인용 전망대 입장권과 맥주 각각 26,000원인 맥주 패키지를 샀습니다. 타워만 20,000이었을 거라고 생각하면 나쁘지 않습니다. 서울에서 가장 싼 맥주 ㅋㅋㅋㅋ 엘리베이터를 타고 꼭대기로 올라가기 전에 맥주를 모아야 합니다. 보기는 꽤 평균입니다. 그것은 당신이 많은 역사적인 장소를 내려다보고있는 에펠 탑과 다릅니다. 여기에서는 콘크리트 정글을 거의 볼 수 있습니다. 우리가 내려왔을 때 우리는 자물쇠를 사서 그 위에 우리의 메시지를 적고 그것을 울타리에 걸었습니다. 기발하지만 우리는 즐겼습니다. 마침내 우리는 매우 즐겁고 권장되는 바닥으로 걸어갔습니다."
982,982,326,3939,"It is easy to get to N Seoul Tower (travelled by train, forgot the station name, Tourist Information is very helpful if you ask them). It is a beautiful place, very scenic, I think everyone who visits Seoul should go to. Remember to have your camera. I recommend this for anyone however, for those with leg problem, they can only stay around Seoul Tower as the staircase is very very long to get to the top to look at the love lock. We had a great time there and took lots of pictures. My family and I enjoyed it very much (despite the bitter winter).",982,much,N서울타워에 쉽게 갈 수 있습니다. 서울을 방문하는 사람이라면 누구나 한번쯤은 가봐야 할 곳이라고 생각합니다. 카메라를 가지고 있어야 합니다. 나는 이것을 누구에게나 추천하지만 다리에 문제가있는 사람들은 사랑의 자물쇠를보기 위해 꼭대기까지 올라가는 계단이 매우 길기 때문에 서울 타워 주변에만 머물 수 있습니다. 우리는 그곳에서 즐거운 시간을 보냈고 많은 사진을 찍었습니다. 우리 가족과 나는 그것을 매우 즐겼습니다(혹독한 겨울에도 불구하고).
983,983,327,3955,Visited twice. 1st time went up with bus & 2nd time went up with cable car. The view is beautiful. Love this place so much.,983,much,"두 번 방문했습니다. 첫 번째는 버스로, 두 번째는 케이블카로 올라갔습니다. 보기가 아름답습니다. 이 장소를 너무 좋아합니다."
984,984,328,3966,"The views of the city are beautiful & there is some space for kids to roam around. We have visited in the daytime& it was foggy but we could still see well, and we have also visited at night, which offers its own beautiful view of Seoul. The gift shop has fun little souvenirs. Get directions on taking the bus here. It is much easier, especially when visiting with children. The tram is fun, but too much waiting & walking, so we prefer the bus .",984,much,도시의 전망이 아름답고 아이들이 돌아 다닐 수있는 공간이 있습니다. 우리는 낮에 방문했고 안개가 꼈지만 여전히 잘 볼 수 있었고 서울의 아름다운 전망을 제공하는 밤에도 방문했습니다. 선물 가게에는 재미있는 작은 기념품이 있습니다. 여기에서 버스를 타는 방법을 알아보세요. 특히 아이들과 함께 방문할 때 훨씬 쉽습니다. 트램은 재미있지만 기다림과 걷기가 너무 많아 버스를 선호합니다.
985,985,329,3970,"I've been to Seoul multiple times, but never made it up to the tower until this last visit. It was pretty much what I expected (def. not lacking on cheesy-tourist stands/tchotchkes), but I'm giving it 4 stars still because of the absolutely gorgeous views of Seoul. They even have little map lines on the windows so you can see what neighborhoods you're looking at... Plus you ""blast off"" to space in the elevator which is pretty hilarious and awesome.  Just for the views alone, I'd recommend everyone going at least once!",985,much,"나는 서울에 여러 번 갔지만 마지막 방문 때까지 타워에 올라가 본 적이 없습니다. 그것은 내가 예상했던 것과 거의 비슷했지만(치즈 관광 가판대/tchotchkes에 부족하지 않음), 서울의 절대적으로 멋진 전망 때문에 여전히 별 4개를 주고 있습니다. 심지어 창문에 작은 지도 선이 있어서 지금 보고 있는 동네를 볼 수 있습니다. 게다가 엘리베이터를 타고 우주로 ""출발""하는 것도 꽤 재미있고 굉장합니다. 보기만 해도 모두에게 한 번쯤은 가보시길 추천합니다!"
986,986,330,3977,We took the Cable Car up to the mountain then the elevator up to the observation deck. You are asked to look up in the elevator and watch a corny spectacle on a TV above you and are told that it takes 30 seconds to the top. Nice view. Best to go on a clear day when there is not much fog. Very people with a lot of people.,986,much,우리는 케이블카를 타고 산으로 올라간 다음 엘리베이터를 타고 전망대로 올라갔습니다. 엘리베이터에서 위를 올려다보고 위의 TV에서 진부한 광경을 시청하라는 요청을 받았으며 정상까지 30초가 걸린다고 합니다. 좋은 전망. 안개가 많지 않은 맑은 날에 가는 것이 가장 좋습니다. 많은 사람들과 함께 매우 사람들.
987,987,331,3981,We came here during cherry blossom - we took cable car and the view was lovely. Nothing much to see in N seoul tower though but it still attract both local and international tourist (like us). It famous with amongst korean drama fans (like me) so yes we take a visit there.,987,much,우리는 벚꽃이 만발하는 동안 여기에 왔습니다. 우리는 케이블카를 탔고 경치는 멋졌습니다. N 서울 타워에서 볼 것이 많지는 않지만 여전히 현지 및 국제 관광객 (우리와 같은)을 끌어들입니다. 한국 드라마 팬(저 같은) 사이에서 유명해서 우리는 그곳을 방문합니다.
988,988,332,3990,"We visited N Seoul Tower at the end of a gray day, so the views were compromised; however, we had a blast! The best fun was the ride up in the cable car. It started snowing and this was quite beautiful. As it was a bit dark out, the views weren't much and the tower itself pales a bit compared to Taipei 101 or the Tokyo Tower, but it is still fun, just a bit touristy. The coup was in walking down through the park. This was a joy and perhaps the most fun of the trip. The tower I could take or leave but the fun of wandering down from it was relaxing and fun.",988,much,"우리는 흐린 날 끝에 N 서울 타워를 방문하여 전망이 손상되었습니다. 그러나 우리는 폭발을 일으켰습니다! 최고의 재미는 케이블카를 타는 것입니다. 눈이 내리기 시작했고 이것은 꽤 아름다웠다. 밖이 조금 어두워서 전망이 좋지 않았고 타워 자체가 타이페이 101이나 도쿄 타워에 비해 약간 창백했지만 여전히 재미 있고 약간 관광객입니다. 쿠데타는 공원을 걷고 있었다. 이것은 여행의 기쁨이자 아마도 가장 재미있었을 것입니다. 탑은 내가 탈 수도 있고 탈 수도 있지만, 그 위에서 아래로 헤매는 재미는 편안하고 재미있었다."
989,989,333,3995,"We truly enjoy hiking to the top of Namsan to the tower. It is a good climb and we finish it off with a churro and ice cream or a burger. As you are climbing, cut off the main trail and onto the smaller trails through the trees. It is steeper, but much faster and more fun.",989,much,우리는 남산 정상에서 타워까지 하이킹을 정말 즐깁니다. 그것은 좋은 등반이며 우리는 츄로와 아이스크림 또는 버거로 마무리합니다. 등반할 때 주요 오솔길을 차단하고 나무 사이로 작은 오솔길로 들어갑니다. 더 가파르지만 훨씬 빠르고 재미있습니다.
990,990,334,4043,"My family and I decided to take the hike up to the N Seoul Tower rather than the cable cars since it had about a 2 hour wait. The hike can get steep and considering how out of shape I am, it was exhausting! You get great views with this hike, and many photo opportunities which I really enjoyed. Once we reached the top, I was just happy that I no longer had to walk! Hah. We purchased our tickets, ant it was about a 1 hour 15 minute walk. We ate at one of the restaurants that offered burgers and beers. All very delicious! We bought the ticket package that offered a free soda and popcorn. And man, that was a lot of popcorn! Completely not necessary. Once we got to the top, it was extremely crowded. The glass were extremely dirty so it was hard to get a good look out. The wait for the elevator ride back down took about 40 minutes. I am much more of a fan of the 63 City Tower.",990,much,"우리 가족은 약 2시간 정도 기다려야 해서 케이블카보다 N서울타워까지 하이킹을 하기로 했다. 하이킹은 가파르게 될 수 있고, 내가 얼마나 몸이 좋지 않은지를 고려하면, 그것은 지쳤습니다! 이 하이킹으로 멋진 전망과 내가 정말 즐겼던 많은 사진 기회를 얻을 수 있습니다. 정상에 오르자 더 이상 걸을 필요가 없어 기뻤습니다! 하. 우리는 우리 표를 샀다, 개미는 도보로 약 1시간 15분이었다. 우리는 햄버거와 맥주를 제공하는 레스토랑 중 한 곳에서 식사를 했습니다. 모두 매우 맛있습니다! 우리는 무료 탄산음료와 팝콘을 제공하는 티켓 패키지를 샀습니다. 그리고 팝콘이 정말 많았어요! 전혀 필요하지 않습니다. 정상에 오르니 엄청나게 붐볐다. 유리가 너무 더러워서 제대로 보기 힘들었습니다. 엘리베이터를 타고 다시 내려오는 데 40분 정도 소요되었습니다. 저는 63 City Tower의 팬입니다."
991,991,335,4080,Went to the N Seoul tower area at night time. It was not too crowded so made for a nicer viewing experience. It's not overly cheap for a ride to the top but it's a rather nice view. It's worth a visit if you want a nice view of the city. Can take as much or as little time as you like.,991,much,밤 시간에 N 서울 타워 지역에 갔다. 너무 붐비지 않아 더 좋은 관람 경험을 위해 만들었습니다. 정상까지 타는 비용이 너무 싼 것은 아니지만 전망은 꽤 좋습니다. 도시의 멋진 전망을 원한다면 방문할 가치가 있습니다. 원하는 만큼 시간이 소요될 수 있습니다.
992,992,336,4088,We walked uphill to reach the tower. It was good exercise and a much needed one too! The view from the top was breathtaking!,992,much,우리는 타워에 도달하기 위해 오르막길을 걸었습니다. 좋은 운동이었고 많이 필요한 운동이었습니다! 정상에서의 전망은 아슬 아슬했습니다!
993,993,337,4100,"The view of N Seoul Tower was so perfect for couples in love, with all the paddlocks they left behind to show how much they loved each other. The time I were there a feeling of loneliness suddenly set in. Becasuse I lost my husband 16 years ago. But after seeing lots of couples enjoyed taking pictures at that romantic place, I was relieved of the loneliness and feel very happy for them.",993,much,N 서울 타워의 전망은 사랑에 빠진 커플에게 너무 완벽했습니다. 그들이 서로를 얼마나 사랑하는지 보여주기 위해 모든 자물쇠가 남겨져있었습니다. 그곳에 있을 때 갑자기 외로움이 밀려왔습니다. 16년 전에 남편을 잃었기 때문입니다. 하지만 그 낭만적인 곳에서 많은 커플들이 사진을 찍고 즐거워하는 모습을 보니 외로움도 많이 풀렸고 그 모습이 너무 행복했습니다.
994,994,338,4101,"Came here in mid November and still had a great look of Autumn leaves. If going to the tower is your thing, it is 9000 won per person without any deals. I breezed through it as there is only so long you can look at city views. On the other hand, the base of the tower gives good enough views at all 360 degrees and there's restaurants and cafes to spend time there too. I highly recommend at least taking the 30 minutes walk down after you're done. You save some money and is a very pleasant walk. Lastly, choose a clear and sunny day, otherwise there's nothing much to see.",994,much,"11월 중순에 이곳에 왔는데 아직 가을 단풍이 멋졌습니다. 타워에 가는 것이 당신의 일이라면 1인당 9,000원입니다. 당신이 도시 전망을 볼 수 있는 시간이 거기에 있기 때문에 나는 그것을 통해 바람을 피웠다. 한편 타워 기단은 360도 어느 곳에서나 충분히 조망할 수 있으며, 그곳에서 시간을 보낼 수 있는 레스토랑과 카페도 있습니다. 나는 당신이 끝난 후 적어도 30 분을 걷는 것을 강력히 추천합니다. 당신은 약간의 돈을 절약하고 매우 즐거운 산책입니다. 마지막으로, 맑고 화창한 날을 선택하십시오. 그렇지 않으면 볼 것이 별로 없습니다."
995,995,339,4110,The line up to the Observatory will take about 40minutes. Once at the the tower I was in awe seeing all the city lights. The view is awesome. But there isn't much activity so after a few photos taken we went back down. It takes more time to line up than staying on top of the tower for the view of Seoul City,995,much,전망대까지의 줄은 약 40분 정도 소요됩니다. 일단 타워에서 나는 모든 도시의 불빛을 보고 경외감에 빠졌습니다. 보기는 굉장합니다. 그러나 활동이 많지 않아 몇 장의 사진을 찍은 후 다시 내려갔습니다. 타워 꼭대기에 서서 서울 시내를 바라보는 것보다 줄을 서는 시간이 더 오래 걸린다.
996,996,340,4119,"We took the Seoul city tour bus up to the tower. You still have to go up an incline to get to the base of the tower. The place is quite crowded with many tourists. And it is a bit of wait to go up. It's extremely expensive. It is not much different from visiting the Empire State Building or the CN tower. When we were there, one of the women's toilet exploded. Quite gross, but not much you can do when someone overstuffed the thing.",996,much,우리는 타워까지 서울 시티 투어 버스를 탔다. 탑 기슭에 가려면 여전히 경사를 올라야 합니다. 많은 관광객들로 붐비는 곳입니다. 그리고 올라오려면 조금 기다려야 합니다. 그것은 매우 비싸다. 엠파이어 스테이트 빌딩이나 CN 타워를 방문하는 것과 크게 다르지 않습니다. 우리가 거기에 있었을 때 여자 ​​화장실 중 하나가 폭발했습니다. 꽤 끔찍하지만 누군가가 물건을 과도하게 채울 때 할 수 있는 일은 많지 않습니다.
997,997,341,4124,Went here yesterday and finally after 3 hours managed to get to the top of the n tower. Be prepared to wait. And be prepared to wait a long time!! We waited over an hour just to get on the cable car and then had to wait again to go up the tower. The cable car takes you up the steep hill to the base of the tower and then you need to take the elevator to the top. It is possible to walk to the base of the tower but it is quite a long steep walk. That may be preferable to waiting the 70 mins we waited for the cable car though  Views from the top are magnificent though. Make sure your going on a clear day as you'd be pretty annoyed to wait so long to get up to not see much,997,much,어제 여기에 갔고 마침내 3 시간 후에 n 타워의 꼭대기에 도착했습니다. 기다릴 준비를 하십시오. 그리고 오래 기다릴 각오!! 우리는 케이블카를 타기 위해 한 시간 이상을 기다렸다가 타워를 오르기 위해 다시 기다려야했습니다. 케이블카를 타고 가파른 언덕을 올라 타워 바닥까지 올라간 다음 엘리베이터를 타고 꼭대기까지 올라야 합니다. 타워 기슭까지 걸어갈 수는 있지만 꽤 길고 가파른 길입니다. 정상에서의 전망은 훌륭하지만 케이블카를 기다리는 70 분을 기다리는 것보다 낫습니다. 많이 보지 않기 위해 너무 오래 기다리면 짜증이 날 수 있으므로 맑은 날에 가십시오.
998,998,342,4146,"The N Seoul Tower was a serious touristy spot. The night we went was incredibly crowded - they had several busses of kids there touring the tower so our wait to even get up to the elevators was and hour or so long. Once we got to the top, the view was gorgeous. Seoul was a huge city! Our way down took almost just as long as it did to go up. There was a line that snaked around to wait for the two elevators to take us back to the cable car. You pay a few extra dollars, but it's worth it to take the cable car down to the ground floor. Overall, I'm not too much into crowded places so probably won't be back again. However, I am a believer of always trying things as least once!",998,much,N 서울 타워는 심각한 관광지였습니다. 우리가 갔던 밤은 엄청나게 붐볐습니다. 거기에는 타워를 여행하는 어린이 버스가 여러 대 있어서 엘리베이터까지 기다리는 시간도 한 시간 정도였습니다. 정상에 올라서니 뷰가 정말 멋졌습니다. 서울은 거대한 도시였다! 내려가는 길은 올라가는 데 거의 시간이 걸렸습니다. 2대의 엘리베이터가 우리를 케이블카로 데려다 줄 때까지 줄을 서 있었습니다. 몇 달러를 추가로 지불해야 하지만 케이블카를 타고 1층으로 내려가는 것은 그만한 가치가 있습니다. 전반적으로 나는 붐비는 장소를 너무 좋아하지 않으므로 아마도 다시 돌아 오지 않을 것입니다. 그러나 나는 항상 한 번은 시도하는 것을 믿습니다!
999,999,343,4148,"I enjoyed all the different view with the different cities (how far away each city is). The gift shop has so much to offer. I mailed postcards from the Tower. It is expensive to eat at the Tower. The day we went to Tower was raining and overcast, which made it appear very smog. Would go again anytime!",999,much,나는 다른 도시와 함께 모든 다른 보기를 즐겼습니다(각 도시가 얼마나 멀리 떨어져 있는지). 선물 가게에는 많은 것이 있습니다. 나는 타워에서 엽서를 보냈다. 타워에서 먹는 것은 비싸다. 우리가 타워에 갔던 날은 비가 오고 흐려서 스모그가 많이 보였다. 언제든지 다시 갈 것입니다!
1000,1000,344,4165,"If you've seen pictures of Seoul, chances are you've seen one with the N Seoul Tower. Korea doesn't have much in the way of architectural landmarks - at least, not as many as some other tourist hotspots - but this tower has always provided a focal point in the Seoul city skyline.  The surrounding area under the tower has a handful of souvenir stores, restaurants, and cafes while the tower itself provides some good eats married with good views of the city.  A meal at the N Seoul Tower at night proves to be a great activity... just remember to cross your fingers and hope that no fog nor smog ruin the views during your visit.",1000,much,"서울 사진을 본 적이 있다면 N서울타워가 있는 사진을 본 적이 있을 것입니다. 한국에는 건축물의 랜드마크가 별로 없습니다. 적어도 다른 관광 명소만큼 많지는 않습니다. 하지만 이 타워는 항상 서울 도시 스카이라인의 초점을 제공했습니다. 타워 아래의 주변 지역에는 기념품 가게, 레스토랑, 카페가 몇 군데 있으며 타워 자체에는 도시의 멋진 전망과 함께 맛있는 음식을 제공합니다. 밤에 N 서울 타워에서 식사하는 것은 훌륭한 활동임이 입증되었습니다... 방문하는 동안 안개나 스모그가 전망을 망치지 않기를 바랍니다."
1001,1001,345,4170,"I went in the late morning, sun was behind the tower, could not take photo.  Nothing much to see except if you are keen in the couple lock.  Night view is much nicer",1001,much,나는 늦은 아침에 갔고 태양은 타워 뒤에 있었고 사진을 찍을 수 없었습니다. 커플 잠금 장치에 열중하는 경우를 제외하고는 볼 것이 별로 없습니다. 야경이 훨씬 멋집니다
1002,1002,346,4171,"Not sure if it was just the day we got there but once up to the top, We couldn't see much as it was very smoggy. The ride to the top was one a minute. Small elevator but the line up was very short. It's interesting looking at the million of love locks.",1002,much,우리가 거기에 도착한 날인지 확실하지 않지만 한 번 정상에 올라서면 스모그가 많이 껴서 많이 볼 수 없었습니다. 정상까지의 소요 시간은 1분이었습니다. 작은 엘리베이터지만 줄은 매우 짧습니다. 수백만 개의 사랑의 자물쇠를 보는 것은 흥미 롭습니다.
1003,1003,347,4192,"Long queue up to Namsan Tower. Was advised that the best view is during sunset but missed it due to the long queue to the foothill of the tower.  Locals and tourists flock to this tourist spot for the love-locks which have become a lovers' haunt. Other than that, nothing much to do there.",1003,much,남산타워까지 길게 늘어선 줄. 가장 좋은 전망은 일몰 동안이라는 조언을 받았지만 타워의 산기슭까지 긴 대기열로 인해 놓쳤습니다. 연인들의 소굴이 된 사랑의 자물쇠를 찾기 위해 현지인과 관광객들이 이 관광지로 모여듭니다. 그 외에는 별로 할 것이 없습니다.
1004,1004,348,4194,"Its a good experience though. I recommend hiking rather than riding the cable car on the way to the top. Its good theres show during 4pm onwards outside the vicinity. The observatory is so so. You can see the buildings, and thats it hehe.. Nothing much special but its worth an experience though.",1004,much,그래도 좋은 경험입니다. 정상까지 가는 길은 케이블카보다는 등산을 추천합니다. 그 좋은 테레즈는 오후 4시에 인근 외부에서 계속됩니다. 전망대는 그렇네요. 당신은 건물을 볼 수 있습니다. 그리고 그것은 hehe..별로 특별한 것은 없지만 경험할만한 가치가 있습니다.
1005,1005,349,4195,"We bought tickets to go to the observatory, glad we used a discount coupon. It's like we bought entrance tickets to a souvenir shop to be honest. A short elevator ride and an even shorter walk around the observatory. Nothing much to see or do there.  The vicinity is nice, interesting to see all the locks and the night view of Seoul but no need to go up the observatory. I find that it's a waste of time and money (even if it was relatively cheap using coupons).",1005,much,우리는 전망대에 가기 위해 티켓을 샀고 할인 쿠폰을 사용해서 기뻤습니다. 솔직히 기념품 가게 입장권을 샀던 것 같다. 엘리베이터를 타고 조금만 더 가면 전망대 주변을 둘러볼 수 있습니다. 볼 것도 할 것도 별로 없습니다. 주변은 멋지고 모든 자물쇠와 서울의 야경을 볼 수 있지만 전망대에 올라갈 필요는 없습니다. (비교적 쿠폰을 사용하여 저렴하더라도) 시간과 돈의 낭비라는 것을 알게 되었습니다.
1006,1006,350,4203,"We took the Namsan cable car to get here, that was quite an experience on its own. Had lunch straight away upon arrival at Best Burger in Seoul (yum!). Great facilities and friendly staff at N Seoul Tower made us feel comfortable. We took the lift up to observation deck, had our souvenir photo taken, and very much enjoyed the birds eye view from the top.",1006,much,"우리는 남산 케이블카를 타고 여기까지 왔는데, 그 자체로 상당한 경험이었습니다. 서울 베스트 버거에 도착하자마자 점심을 먹었습니다 (yum!). N 서울 타워의 훌륭한 시설과 친절한 직원은 우리를 편안하게 만들었습니다. 전망대까지 리프트를 타고 올라가 기념사진도 찍고 정상에서 조감도를 즐겼습니다."
1007,1007,351,4216,"That is, if you've already visited other towers in the world much taller, newer viewing towers in other parts of the world. The copy cat Love Locks are a nice touch. And it does give a 360 degree view of Seoul skyline. There's a souvenir shop (not too pricy). And that's all there is to it. Go for it for a 'routine' part of the package tour.",1007,much,"즉, 이미 세계의 다른 타워를 방문한 적이 있는 경우 훨씬 더 높고 세계의 다른 지역에 있는 최신 전망대입니다. 복사 고양이 Love Locks는 좋은 터치입니다. 그리고 서울의 스카이라인을 360도로 보여줍니다. 기념품 가게가 있습니다(너무 비싸지 않음). 그리고 그게 전부입니다. 패키지 여행의 '일상적인' 부분으로 이동하십시오."
1008,1008,352,4222,"I have been here twice and the second time I went up to the viewing deck. It was cool to see Seoul from that height. We took the local bus to get there, which is so much cheaper than the cable car, but we did get stuck in traffic which was annoying. I imagine that the view from the top at night would be spectacular, we went in the afternoon and spent some time figuring out what we could see from the top.",1008,much,"나는 여기에 두 번 있었고 두 번째로 전망대에 올라갔습니다. 그 높이에서 서울을 바라보는 것이 멋졌다. 우리는 케이블카보다 훨씬 저렴한 시내 버스를 타고 거기에 도착했지만 우리는 성가신 교통 체증에 걸렸습니다. 나는 밤에 정상에서 보는 경치가 장관일 것이라고 상상하고, 우리는 오후에 가서 우리가 정상에서 무엇을 볼 수 있는지 알아내는 데 시간을 보냈습니다."
1009,1009,353,4225,"It seems like a mark of Seoul. When I went there in the daytime, not felt much special. There were some performances right outside the tower, seemed special.",1009,much,서울의 상징인 것 같습니다. 낮에 갔을 때는 그다지 특별하게 느껴지지 않았습니다. 타워 바로 바깥에서 일부 공연이 있었는데 특별해 보였습니다.
1010,1010,354,4247,went here at night time. the attraction is recommended for visit. bring your own couple padlock here to save money :p. the ticket to go up is quite expensive and nothing much at the top. should consider to go up when you are in tight budget.,1010,much,밤 시간에 여기에 갔다. 명소를 방문하는 것이 좋습니다. 돈을 절약하기 위해 여기에 자신의 커플 자물쇠를 가져 오십시오 :p. 올라가는 티켓은 꽤 비싸고 정상에는 많지 않습니다. 예산이 빠듯할 때 증가하는 것을 고려해야 합니다.
1011,1011,355,4248,"Buy a one way ticket up- the lines are long going up, and can be worse coming back down, but much easier to walk down (lots of steps) unless you don't mind spending the extra won and time waiting.",1011,much,편도 티켓을 구입하십시오. 줄이 길어지고 다시 내려 오는 것이 더 나빠질 수 있지만 여분의 원과 기다리는 시간을 보내는 데 신경 쓰지 않는 한 걷는 것이 훨씬 쉽습니다 (많은 단계).
1012,1012,356,4249,I was pleased to send postcards from such place.  The tower itself is only ~200m and it costs 6000w to get to the top. Bit too much considering how hard it is to get there by foot or 8500w cost of round trip in a cable car. Not recommended.,1012,much,그런 곳에서 엽서를 보내게 되어 기뻤습니다. 타워 자체는 ~200m에 불과하며 정상에 도달하는 데 6000w가 소요됩니다. 도보로 이동하는 것이 얼마나 어려운지 또는 케이블카에서 왕복 8500w의 비용을 고려하면 조금 너무합니다. 권장하지 않습니다.

1014,1014,358,4258,"The view is great. You can see Han river, some landmark buildings, hills. You can see various districts of Seoul, skyscrapers next to Yeouido Park, but there is not much more in it. Anyway, it's definitely worth the visit for the view.",1014,much,"보기는 훌륭합니다. 한강, 일부 랜드마크 건물, 언덕을 볼 수 있습니다. 서울의 여러 지역, 여의도 공원 옆에 고층 빌딩이 보이지만 그 이상은 없습니다. 어쨌든 전망을 위해 방문할 가치가 있습니다."
1015,1015,359,4266,"Very nice view overseeing the whole Seoul city from here. Just like Mandalay Hill, Myanmar, I admit that a bit more greener. Admission fees 9,000 Wan. A lot of people young couples and Korean family were her, not much tourist in August and weather please us and clear sky view.  What please me here, I see many lovers, couples, souvenir, Ice cream, sweets, coffee, a good panoramic view, you are not visiting Seoul, if your vacation planner omit this one, we had a good time with students from Myanmar. I miss our guide Ms. Jeinie!",1015,much,"여기에서 서울 전체를 내려다보는 아주 멋진 전망. 미얀마의 만달레이 힐과 마찬가지로 조금 더 푸르른 것을 인정합니다. 입장료 9,000원. 많은 젊은 커플과 한국 가족이 그녀였습니다. 8월의 관광객은 많지 않았고 날씨는 우리를 기쁘게 하고 맑은 하늘을 봅니다. 여기에서 나를 기쁘게하는 것은 많은 연인, 커플, 기념품, 아이스크림, 과자, 커피, 좋은 파노라마 전망, 당신은 서울에 가지 않을 것입니다. 당신의 휴가 계획자가 이것을 생략한다면 우리는 미얀마에서 온 학생들과 즐거운 시간을 보냈습니다. 우리 가이드 Ms. Jeinie가 그리워요!"
1016,1016,360,4305,Such a notable landmark so you really do need to do this at least once. Many nice places for photo opportunities. Seen in many dramas the site where all of the locks from couples are. We went late at night and didn't have much of a wait time. Night view was beautiful though probably day time view would have been better to see all the detail sections of Seoul. But we weren't really wanting to go so bad that we would stand in line for 2 hours as some of the reviews stated. Late night we waited about 10 minutes.,1016,much,이러한 주목할만한 랜드 마크이므로 적어도 한 번은해야합니다. 사진을 찍을 수 있는 좋은 장소가 많이 있습니다. 많은 드라마에서 본 커플들의 자물쇠가 다 있는 사이트. 저희는 밤늦게 갔더니 대기시간이 별로 없었어요. 야경은 아름다웠지만 서울의 모든 세부 구간을 보려면 낮에 보는 것이 더 나았을 것입니다. 그러나 우리는 일부 리뷰에서 언급했듯이 2시간 동안 줄을 서서 너무 나빠지고 싶지 않았습니다. 늦은 밤 우리는 약 10 분을 기다렸습니다.
1017,1017,361,4339,"We made the mistake of hiking up the hill to this tower, it was a nice but extremely steep walk up in killer humidity. There is a lift but we came at it from the wrong direction and never found it, so plan it out properly or you will be sorry like we were! The tower itself is nothing too special, the view is nice and the windows point you in the direction of other countries so that's kind of cool. You can send postcards from the top too. Don't feel too bad if you miss this. Other cities have much better towers.",1017,much,우리는 이 탑까지 언덕을 하이킹하는 실수를 저질렀습니다. 그것은 훌륭했지만 살인자 습도까지 매우 가파른 산보였습니다. 리프트가 있지만 잘못된 방향에서 와서 찾지 못했으므로 제대로 계획하지 않으면 우리처럼 죄송합니다! 타워 자체는 그다지 특별하지 않고 전망이 좋고 창문이 다른 나라의 방향을 가리키므로 일종의 시원합니다. 위에서도 엽서를 보낼 수 있습니다. 이것을 놓치더라도 너무 슬퍼하지 마십시오. 다른 도시에는 훨씬 더 나은 타워가 있습니다.
1018,1018,362,4342,"Our group of 4 walked from Myeongdong to the cable car station at Namsan Hill. Took us 25minutes. The queue for the cable car was relatively short, about 10 minutes as it was a Tuesday evening. Once out of the cable car, you still need to walk up many steps to get to the Seoul tower. There are interesting spots for photography. You have to pay a fee to get up to the observation deck. The night view was lovely. The lighted bridges along the Han River were specially awesome. The quip was that we couldn't take photos as the light from the shop in the tower casted too much reflection on the glass. You can send a postcard back home from there as the shop sells stamps, cards and has a post box! Overall, it was a memorable and fun visit.",1018,much,"우리 4인조는 명동에서 남산힐 케이블카 정류장까지 걸어갔다. 25분이 걸렸습니다. 케이블카의 대기줄은 화요일 저녁이라 10분 내외로 비교적 짧았다. 케이블카에서 내리면 서울타워까지는 여전히 많은 계단을 올라야 합니다. 재미있는 사진 촬영 장소가 있습니다. 전망대에 올라가려면 요금을 내야 합니다. 야경이 멋졌습니다. 특히 한강변의 조명이 켜진 다리는 정말 장관이었습니다. 단점은 타워에 있는 상점의 빛이 유리에 너무 많이 반사되어 사진을 찍을 수 없다는 것이었습니다. 가게에서 우표, 카드를 판매하고 우체통이 있기 때문에 거기에서 집으로 엽서를 보낼 수 있습니다! 전반적으로 기억에 남고 재미있는 방문이었습니다."
1019,1019,363,4349,"I feel like it's worth it. It IS expensive, though. I forget exactly how much, but around 20-30 won per person. But it's beautiful and if you can afford it, I would go.",1019,much,그만한 가치가 있는 것 같아요. 하지만 비싸다. 얼마인지는 정확히 기억나지 않지만 1인당 20~30원 정도. 그러나 그것은 아름답고 당신이 그것을 감당할 수 있다면 나는 갈 것입니다.
1020,1020,364,4360,"I really don't get the appeal of this place...yes, sure, the view is nice from the top, but the cable cars were terribly full and so was the location...there were just too many people to really immerse yourself in the experience. The tower itself is simply a tower which lights up in different colours, it's no architectural masterpiece. If you plan on walking up to the tower be prepared for a very steep ascent with many steps, so bring plenty of water. It's quite a hike to the top, but great exercise. I'd much rather go to one of the city's amazing art exhibitions than see this overcrowded attraction.",1020,much,"나는 정말로 장소의 매력을 이해하지 못했습니다 ... 예, 물론, 정상에서보기는 좋지만 케이블카는 끔찍하게 가득차 있었고 위치도 마찬가지였습니다 ... 너무 많은 사람들이 실제로 몰입 할 수 없었습니다. 경험에서 자신. 타워 자체는 단순히 다른 색상으로 빛나는 타워일 뿐이며 건축학적 걸작은 아닙니다. 타워까지 걸어갈 계획이라면 계단이 많이 있는 매우 가파른 오르막을 준비해야 하므로 충분한 물을 가져오세요. 정상까지 가는 것은 꽤 힘들지만 훌륭한 운동입니다. 나는 이 붐비는 명소를 보는 것보다 도시의 놀라운 예술 전시회에 가는 것이 훨씬 낫습니다."
1021,1021,365,4378,"Tower is pricier than we expected, and it was surprisingly poor visibility at the top. We thought views were equally as nice from Namsan park.  If you decide to go up,sunset is a beautiful it popular time - get there much earlier than you think is necessary, especially if by cable car ad the line backs up quickly.  Best to take the bus to the top, which runs frequently straight to the top since taxis can't go up. Bus stops running earlier though, so plan to walk or take cable car back down mountain if you'll be there later than 9.",1021,much,"타워는 우리가 예상했던 것보다 비싸고, 정상에서의 시야는 놀라울 정도로 좋지 않았습니다. 우리는 남산 공원의 전망이 똑같이 좋다고 생각했습니다. 올라가기로 결정했다면 일몰이 아름답고 인기 있는 시간입니다. 특히 케이블카 광고로 줄이 빠르게 백업되는 경우 필요하다고 생각하는 것보다 훨씬 일찍 도착하세요. 택시가 올라갈 수 없기 때문에 정상까지 자주 직진하는 버스를 타는 것이 가장 좋습니다. 그러나 버스는 더 일찍 정차하므로 9시 이후에 도착할 예정이라면 걷거나 케이블카를 타고 다시 산으로 내려오는 것을 계획하세요."
1022,1022,366,4381,"I was there in September 2014, even though I haven't been to the top of the tower yet but the atmosphere surrounding the tower was fabulous.  My friend and I took a bus from the station, I forgot the name already, and left the bus at the N-tower station. It is an up-hill street which you have to walk till you reach the tower.  I did not enjoy the view that much but the atmosphere was impressive. Families, couples and friends were enjoying their moment together at the tower.  So, I just fall in love with the atmosphere not the tower itself. But such a good place to go indeed.",1022,much,"나는 2014년 9월에 거기에 갔지만 아직 타워의 꼭대기에 가보지는 않았지만 타워를 둘러싼 분위기는 환상적이었습니다. 친구와 나는 역에서 버스를 탔는데 이미 이름을 잊어버리고 N타워 역에서 내렸다. 타워에 도달할 때까지 걸어야 하는 오르막 길입니다. 나는 전망을 그다지 즐기지 않았지만 분위기는 인상적이었습니다. 가족, 커플, 친구들이 타워에서 함께 시간을 즐기고 있었습니다. 그래서 나는 타워 자체가 아니라 분위기에 사랑에 빠졌습니다. 하지만 정말 가기 좋은 곳."
1023,1023,367,4389,"The Seoul Tower in Namsam park really does offer amazing views of the city. I didn't actually go up thought because you can get great views from the base, but Seoul was surprisingly a little smoggy.  The reason I don't give it a full 5 stars is because its very touristy, and there are much nicer places to get beautiful views of the city, of course they may require a bit of hiking, but I think its worth it.",1023,much,남삼공원에 있는 서울타워는 정말 도시의 멋진 전망을 제공합니다. 베이스에서 멋진 전망을 볼 수 있기 때문에 실제로 생각하지 않았지만 서울은 놀랍게도 약간 스모그였습니다. 별 5개 만점을 주지 않는 이유는 관광지가 매우 많고 도시의 아름다운 전망을 감상할 수 있는 더 멋진 장소가 있기 때문입니다. 물론 약간의 하이킹이 필요할 수도 있지만 그만한 가치가 있다고 생각합니다.
1024,1024,368,4392,I went two time nothin the morning and the view is great although I think the night scene on the top of the hill if Nam San should be very good too. Both taking cable car and bus are convenient to coming up but I felt taking bus is better for elderly and not much slop needed for going up to station,1024,much,"아침에 2번이나 갔는데 남산산 정상의 야경도 너무 좋았으면 하는 생각이 들지만 뷰는 정말 좋습니다. 케이블카와 버스 모두 오르기 편하지만, 노약자에게는 버스를 타는 것이 더 좋고 역까지 가는데 큰 불편이 없다는 생각이 들었습니다."
1025,1025,369,4405,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much as there is so many of these views and towers around the world. A friend of mine took me there in the evening and after a while of waiting to get up, the most spectacular view I've ever had in my life appeared. Seoul is an incredible metropolis and the experience of seeing all those lights from the top felt almost incredible. I think I will have this picture in front of my eyes forever! :)",1025,much,"솔직히 전 세계에 이런 전망과 타워가 너무 많아서 기대하지 않았습니다. 내 친구가 저녁에 그곳으로 나를 데려갔고, 일어나기 위해 잠시 기다린 후에 내 인생에서 본 것 중 가장 멋진 광경이 나타났습니다. 서울은 놀라운 대도시이며 꼭대기에서 모든 빛을 보는 경험은 거의 믿을 수 없을 정도로 느껴졌습니다. 이 사진은 평생 내 눈앞에 있을 것 같아요! :)"
1026,1026,370,4410,"You must not visit at night time, otherwise you will not be able to see the view as the glass reflects the interior light. So please visit during the day for a greater experience.  But still it has a great view however I was not able to enjoy much because the windows reflect and there were a lot tourists in a small area.",1026,much,야간에는 방문하지 마세요. 유리에 실내 조명이 반사되어 경치를 볼 수 없습니다. 따라서 더 큰 경험을 위해 낮에 방문하십시오. 그래도 뷰는 좋은데 창문에 반사가 되고 협소한 지역에 관광객이 많아서 많이 즐기지는 못했어요.
1027,1027,371,4411,"I booked a tour to do this so the bus drove us up to a certain point and we walked the other half up. The hill is very steep. You will get a great workout. I do not recommend doing this when it is extremely warm in Korea as the humidity is very high and if you not accustomed to it could cause you great harm.  I was looking forward to seeing the N. Seoul Tower from the minute of booking my trip to Seoul. I booked a nite trip with Koridoor (we stopped at other locations as well as the N.Seoul Tower). The elevator ride up was great. I LOVED the view from up there however trying to take photos were hard because of the glare off the glass so that ruined it for me because I couldn't get the great shots that I wanted to get. If taking pictures really isn't at the top of your list then YES, it is a must see other than that go in the day time and the glares from the indoor lights may not affect your pictures as much as the night time views.  Before going up on the tower there is some areas to sit around and some shops to purchase food/snacks such as Coldstone. They also have the love lock area. You can purchase a lock from inside the gift store and put a lock on there. The view from there reminds of looking out over any city at night. It was great but nothing like looking at it from the Tower itself.",1027,much,"나는 버스가 우리를 특정 지점까지 몰고 갔고 우리는 나머지 절반을 걸었을 정도로 이것을 하기 위해 여행을 예약했습니다. 언덕이 매우 가파르다. 당신은 훌륭한 운동을 얻을 것이다. 한국은 습도가 매우 높고, 적응하지 않으면 큰 피해를 입을 수 있기 때문에 한국에서 매우 더울 때는 하지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 서울 여행을 예약하는 순간부터 N.서울타워가 보고 싶었다. 나는 고리도어와 함께 야간 여행을 예약했습니다(우리는 N.Seoul Tower뿐만 아니라 다른 장소에서 멈췄습니다). 엘리베이터 타는 것은 훌륭했습니다. 나는 거기에서 보는 경치를 좋아했지만 사진을 찍으려고 애쓰는 것은 유리의 눈부심 때문에 어려웠습니다. 그래서 내가 얻고 싶은 멋진 사진을 얻을 수 없었기 때문에 그것을 망쳤습니다. 사진을 찍는 것이 목록의 맨 위에 있지 않다면 예, 낮에 가는 것 외에는 반드시 봐야 하며 실내 조명의 눈부심은 야경만큼 사진에 영향을 미치지 않을 수 있습니다. 타워에 올라가기 전에 앉을 수 있는 공간과 Coldstone과 같은 음식/간식을 구입할 수 있는 상점이 있습니다. 그들은 또한 사랑의 자물쇠 영역이 있습니다. 선물 가게 안에서 자물쇠를 사서 거기에 자물쇠를 걸 수 있습니다. 그곳에서 바라보는 경치는 밤에 어떤 도시를 내려다보는 것을 생각나게 합니다. 그것은 훌륭했지만 타워 자체에서 보는 것과 같은 것은 아닙니다."
1028,1028,372,4414,Great night scene and worth checking out if you are in Seoul. Great view but depends on the level of clouds / smog how much you can see.,1028,much,멋진 야경과 서울에 있다면 체크 아웃 할 가치가 있습니다. 멋진 전망이지만 구름 / 스모그의 수준에 따라 얼마나 많이 볼 수 있습니까?

Every visitor we've had we take to seoul tower and they love it just as much as we do! This last time we went we did the love lock and it was so fun to lock our love in seoul! They have many great restaurants and souvenir shops up there as well!,1029,much,나는 지금 서울 타워에 4 번 갔고 볼 때마다 점점 더 좋아합니다! 서울타워에서 바라보는 뷰가 정말 끝내줍니다! 우리가 가진 모든 방문자는 서울 타워에 데려갔고 그들은 우리만큼 그것을 좋아합니다! 우리가 지난번에 갔을 때 우리는 사랑의 자물쇠를했고 서울에서 우리의 사랑을 잠그는 것이 너무 재미있었습니다! 그들은 많은 훌륭한 레스토랑과 기념품 가게도 있습니다!
1030,1030,374,4435,"Everyone said n Seoul tower is a must-go spot in Seoul. However, when I got there, I felt it was just okay, especially the view from the tower. It is true that I could see the whole city from the tower, but there is seriously nothing much to see. Probably that was because I didn't visit at the right time. And the visit was quite short because the tower is not big either. But the view under the tower is pretty cool. I love the scenery under the tower a lot. And you can breath the fresh air there.",1030,much,"모두들 n서울타워는 서울에서 꼭 가봐야 할 곳이라고 했다. 그러나 내가 거기에 도착했을 때, 특히 타워에서 보는 전망이 괜찮다는 것을 느꼈습니다. 타워에서 도시 전체를 볼 수 있었던 것은 사실이지만 심각하게 볼 것이 별로 없습니다. 아마도 제 시간에 방문하지 않았기 때문일 것입니다. 그리고 타워도 크지 않아서 방문시간이 꽤 짧았습니다. 그러나 타워 아래의 전망은 꽤 시원합니다. 나는 타워 아래의 풍경을 아주 좋아합니다. 그리고 그곳에서 신선한 공기를 마실 수 있습니다."
1031,1031,375,4437,"Went during the spring, and was carrying high hopes (as many reviewers stated it is beautiful) that it may surprise me to capture its beauty. But was very disappointed, it was concealed and couldnt view much. We queued for more than 3hrs plus just to go up to the tower to find disappointments. (imo) not worth :)",1031,much,"봄에 갔고 (많은 리뷰어들이 아름답다고 말했듯이) 그 아름다움을 포착하는 것이 나를 놀라게 할 수 있다는 높은 희망을 가지고있었습니다. 그러나 그것은 매우 실망스러웠고, 그것은 숨겨져 많이 볼 수 없었습니다. 우리는 실망을 찾기 위해 타워에 올라가기 위해 3 시간 이상을 대기열에 추가했습니다.

1033,1033,377,4452,"Checked out the Tower on June 24th, 2015. Very easy to access using one of the tour buses. Its about 1300 won or $1.25 USD. Although pic a day that is clear, when we stayed forecast was Haze everyday but we went regardless. Its obviously a great view being up so high, once at the top of the there are plenty of picture opportunities, there also decent pictures to be taken at the base of the tower. Also the guys washroom is great because the urinals have the most amazing view you've ever had while reliving yourself. We went on a weekday i think its slightly cheaper than the weekend but really our currency is valued much higher than theirs so most everything is relatively inexpensive. There is also a tram that can take you up and down, we decided to take it down and it was an ok view, 6000 won one way per person.",1033,much,"2015년 6월 24일에 타워를 확인했습니다. 투어 버스 중 하나를 사용하여 매우 쉽게 접근할 수 있습니다. 약 1300원 또는 $1.25 USD입니다. 사진은 맑은 날이지만 우리가 머물렀을 때 일기예보는 매일 안개였지만 우리는 아무렇지도 않게 갔다. 분명히 멋진 전망이 너무 높아서 일단 정상에 오르면 많은 사진 기회가 있고, 타워 바닥에서도 괜찮은 사진을 찍을 수 있습니다. 또한 남자 화장실은 소변기가 자신을 재현하는 동안 본 것 중 가장 놀라운 전망을 가지고 있기 때문에 훌륭합니다. 우리는 평일에 갔고 주말보다 약간 저렴하다고 생각하지만 실제로 우리 통화는 그들의 통화보다 훨씬 높게 평가되어 대부분의 모든 것이 상대적으로 저렴합니다. 위아래로 탈 수 있는 트램도 있는데 우리는 내리기로 결정했고 1인당 편도 6000원으로 괜찮은 전망이었다."
1034,1034,378,4454,"I went with my mum on a cold night. Fog was everywhere, but decided to take the risk and head up. Caught the cable car to the tower. Only a 15 minute walk from our hotel (Nine Tree in Myeongdong). We waited about an hour for the fog to dissappear, then paid to go up. Again, waited a while inside for the fog to go. Only a restaurant and a few coffee bars inside. Not much else to do inside other than the gift shop. Saw a review on TripAdvisor that said the best view was from the ladies toilets. Strange thing to say, but so true !! The view from outside was just as impressive. The amount of love padlocks there was overwhelming; (being a k-drama fan made being there even more special!). The view of Seoul was stunning, and worth the cold wait !",1034,much,"나는 추운 밤에 엄마와 함께 갔다. 안개가 도처에 있었지만 위험을 감수하고 위로 가기로 결정했습니다. 타워로 가는 케이블카를 탔다. 저희 호텔(명동 나인트리)에서 도보로 단 15분 거리에 있습니다. 우리는 안개가 사라질 때까지 한 시간 정도 기다렸다가 돈을 지불하고 올라갔습니다. 다시, 안개가 갈 때까지 안에서 잠시 기다렸다. 레스토랑과 몇 개의 커피 바만 내부에 있습니다. 기념품 가게 외에는 내부에서 할 일이별로 없습니다. 최고의 전망은 여성용 화장실에서였다는 트립어드바이저 리뷰를 보았습니다. 말이 이상하지만 사실입니다!! 외부에서 보는 전망도 인상적이었습니다. 사랑의 자물쇠가 엄청나게 많았습니다. (K-드라마 팬이 되어 그곳에 있는 것이 더욱 특별해졌습니다!). 서울의 전망은 충격적이었고 추위를 기다릴 가치가있었습니다!"
1035,1035,379,4464,"I've been here once before so I knew what to expect. But I didn't get that. Maybe their budget was cut, or maybe it was MERS to blame, but...  The exhibition, one of those live art deals where you can be a part of the art, was quite lame. I guess it was exactly as described but the atmosphere was empty and there's just not much excitement to have when you can really only do the pose they show you, nothing unique about your experience.  Then there's a SECOND hall, which looked totally devoid of people and I can see why. One is enough.  Going up to the observatory and you get the good views. I've been up enough buildings to know this is your bog standard deal. I actually found the 63 building view to be far superior, because you're closer to stuff for viewing, not up a mountain. the 63 building is in a place where you can see all the traffic and detail, and it's such an unpopular tourist attraction nowadays it takes no time and you get to see all round. So maybe check that out instead.  When I left, I expected the scheduled lights display on the Seoul Tower, which, when I was there a few years back came with music and 3d laser stuff and animations on the floor. This time, I got what seemed to be 3 minutes of silent advertisement on the tower, and nothing else. What an incredible disappointment. I was building up to that moment the whole time. I can only hope it was a one-off thing due to MERS.  Getting back down is hugely inconvenient since there are no taxis or buses, so you have to get this weird elevator down a side cliff, onto the road and walk 15 minutes or so to the subway. And there were no directions or instructions on how to do that; I had to ask a car park ticket officer.",1035,much,"나는 전에 한 번 여기에 있었기 때문에 무엇을 기대해야하는지 알고있었습니다. 그러나 나는 그것을 이해하지 못했다. 예산이 줄었거나 메르스 탓이었을 수도 있지만... 예술의 일부가 될 수 있는 라이브 아트 거래 중 하나인 이번 전시회는 정말 형편없었습니다. 나는 그것이 정확히 설명된 대로라고 생각하지만 분위기는 텅 비어 있었고 그들이 보여주는 포즈만 할 수 있을 때 갖는 흥분은 별로 없고 경험에 대한 독특한 것은 없습니다. 그런 다음 완전히 사람이 없어 보이는 SECOND 홀이 있습니다. 그리고 나는 그 이유를 알 수 있습니다. 하나면 충분합니다. 전망대에 오르면 좋은 전망을 볼 수 있습니다. 나는 이것이 당신의 늪지 표준 거래라는 것을 알기에 충분히 건물을 올라갔습니다. 나는 실제로 63 빌딩 뷰가 훨씬 더 우수하다는 것을 알았습니다. 왜냐하면 산이 아니라 볼 수있는 물건에 더 가깝기 때문입니다. 63 빌딩은 모든 교통과 세부 사항을 볼 수있는 장소에 있으며 요즘에는 인기가없는 관광 명소로 시간이 걸리지 않고 모든 것을 볼 수 있습니다. 그러니 대신 확인해 보세요. 내가 떠날 때 나는 서울 타워에 예정된 조명이 표시되기를 기대했는데, 몇 년 전에 내가 거기에 있었을 때 바닥에 음악과 3D 레이저 물건과 애니메이션이 함께 제공되었습니다. 이번에는 타워에 3분 정도의 묵직한 광고처럼 보이는 것을 얻었고 그 외에는 아무 것도 없었습니다. 정말 놀라운 실망입니다. 나는 그 순간까지 내내 쌓아왔다. 메르스로 인한 일회성 이었길 바랄 뿐입니다. 다시 내려오는 것은 택시나 버스가 없어 매우 불편하기 때문에 이 기이한 엘리베이터를 타고 옆 절벽을 따라 도로 위로 올라가 지하철까지 15분 정도 걸어가야 합니다. 그리고 그렇게 하는 방법에 대한 지시나 지시도 없었습니다. 주차장 매표원에게 물어봐야 했다."
1036,1036,380,4512,"Absolutely love this hike with the kids (4 & 6 yr olds). We started off at the crossroads by Hilton Millennium Hotel and hiked up the stairs. The kids enjoyed themselves and the scenary. My husband who is not fit at all, didn't soo much mind the hike as well. Granted the air quality wasn't so great that day but it was good quality time. I've jogged up the never ending road a few times for a good cardio workout but if you're looking for a good leisurely hike to enjoy with the family highly recommend it.  Getting to the actual tower is a disappointment. Once at the top we couldn't really see much past the US Army base at the foot of the hill because the pollution was bad. We weren't too happy about the condition of the tourist area...looks like the cleaning crew from the night didn't do anything as trash was all over the place. It seemed very dirty in the seated viewing area. We were there at 8am, so perhaps they only do cleaning later in the morning...but for a place that attracts a lot of tourists highly recommend they have it presentable all the time.  Would have given it high rating if it was cleaner.

Go to the observatory tower only your travel budget allow because there's nothing much fun except that you can view the scenery in higher position.

1038,1038,382,4547,We went probably on the wrong day. Saturday evening there were far too many people. Buying the tickets took over 45 minutes and helpfully the lady at the counter told us that the trip to the tower would take another 90 minutes of waiting. And there are not much places to wait! About 2 hours later we were called to board the lift to the observation deck on the top floor. By this time it had started raining and the view was hindered by the water drops on the glass panes of the observatory. So not sure if it was worth the wait.,1038,much,우리는 아마도 잘못된 날에 갔을 것입니다. 토요일 저녁은 사람이 너무 많았다. 티켓을 사는 데 45분이 넘게 걸렸고 도움이 되는 카운터의 아주머니는 타워까지 가는 데 90분이 더 걸릴 것이라고 말했습니다. 그리고 대기할 곳이 별로 없어요! 약 2시간 후 우리는 최상층 전망대로 올라가는 리프트에 탑승하라는 부름을 받았습니다. 이때부터 비가 내리기 시작했고 전망대 유리창에 떨어지는 물방울로 인해 시야가 흐려졌습니다. 그래서 기다릴 가치가 있는지 확실하지 않습니다.

I would recommend that you take the public transportation (bus) and plan about 4 hours (includes the bus trip) for your trip to the tower. It was definitely more interesting than I thought it would be to see how densely populated and the number of high rise apartment and office buildings make up Seoul and with almost every flat piece of land having a high rise on it. I am glad I arrived early in the day (9:45am) as many more people were arriving when I left. This is great way to get your bearings and understand the layout of Seoul. Also important for you to know that they take everyones picture before you step in the elevators and sell them to you at the top at the observation deck. The park like setting on the walk up the hill is very nice. I was also surprised to see the many love locks connected to the fences and other areas at this site. This was made popular by a Korean soap opera and considered very romantic thing to do...which I agree is.  Tips -go early -bring a camera -bring two locks; one for you and your loved one, to add to the many already there...very romantic -purchase the ticket with the popcorn/drink --best deal -plan to eat lunch in downtown Seoul as the food choices are much better",1040,much,"우와! 이것은 서울을 방문하는 동안 모험을해야합니다. 대중교통(버스)을 타고 타워까지 가는데 약 4시간(버스 포함)을 계획하는 것을 추천합니다. 서울을 구성하는 인구 밀도와 고층 아파트 및 사무실 건물의 수와 거의 모든 평평한 땅에 고층 건물이 있는 것을 보는 것은 생각했던 것보다 확실히 더 흥미로웠습니다. 내가 떠났을 때 더 많은 사람들이 도착하고 있었기 때문에 이른 시간 (9:45am)에 도착한 것이 기쁩니다. 이것은 방향을 잡고 서울의 레이아웃을 이해하는 좋은 방법입니다. 또한 엘리베이터를 타기 전에 모두 사진을 찍어 전망대 꼭대기에서 판매한다는 것을 아는 것도 중요합니다. 언덕을 오르는 길에 조성된 공원은 매우 좋습니다. 나는 또한이 사이트의 울타리와 다른 영역에 연결된 많은 사랑의 자물쇠를보고 놀랐습니다. 이것은 한국 연속극에 의해 인기를 얻었고 매우 낭만적인 일이라고 여겨졌습니다... 저도 동의합니다. 팁 - 일찍 가세요 - 카메라를 가져오세요 - 자물쇠 두 개를 가져오세요. 당신과 당신의 사랑하는 사람을 위한 하나, 이미 거기에 있는 많은 것에 추가하기 위해...매우 낭만적인 - 팝콘/음료와 함께 티켓을 구입하십시오 - 최고의 거래 - 음식 선택이 훨씬 더 좋기 때문에 서울 시내에서 점심을 먹을 계획"

1043,1043,387,4596,I liked the visiting of the Tower very much. The way to it was spectacular. You can walk and relax. Once there you can enjoy the fontain which breezes you with almost invisible drops - lovely feeling. Than there is good choice of restaurants or bistros to eat. The tower itself is very difficult to observe if you are staying just underneath. And of course the funicular experience added a very nice atmosphere to that relaxed visit.,1043,much,나는 타워 방문을 매우 좋아했습니다. 가는 길은 장관이었다. 산책과 휴식을 취할 수 있습니다. 거기에 가면 거의 눈에 띄지 않는 물방울로 기분을 상쾌하게 만드는 퐁텐을 즐길 수 있습니다. 사랑스러운 느낌입니다. 먹을 수 있는 레스토랑이나 비스트로를 선택하는 것이 좋습니다. 타워 자체는 바로 아래에 있으면 관찰하기가 매우 어렵습니다. 그리고 물론 케이블카 체험은 그 편안한 방문에 아주 좋은 분위기를 더했습니다.

So all I can say is that on an overcast kinda day, I would just walk around the grounds and maybe do all the FREE things. Going all the way up to the top was nice, but we didn't really get a good view.

I suggest going at night because the view of Seoul is breath taking. It is amazing to see how much Seoul changed from my time as a kid in the '80s until now.

Very long line for the cable car but it's very quick.,1060,much,우리는 9월 밤에 N서울타워에 갔다. 이 지역은 매우 아름답습니다(사랑의 자물쇠와 모든 것). 그러나 나에게 그렇게 되기 때문에 올라가는 것은 추천하지 않습니다. 또 다른 전망대입니다. 그리 크지도 않습니다. 당신이 그런 종류의 일에 관심이 있다면 당신에게 놀라운 일이 될 것입니다. 도쿄 타워가 훨씬 낫습니다. 나는 올라가지 않고 그 지역을 산책하고 앉아있는 것이 더 낫다고 말하고 싶습니다. 케이블카의 줄이 매우 길지만 매우 빠릅니다.
1061,1061,405,4730,"I was told that it's better to visit the tower at night to view the night scenery and I wasn't disappointed. The Christmasy atmosphere was enhanced when it suddenly snowed. There was a steep climb on a slope and it was quite tiring for someone who does not exercise much. Reaching the top of the tower in an elevator within 26 seconds, there isn't much to do up there except view the night scene and visit the souvenir shop.",1061,much,야경을 보기 위해서는 밤에 타워를 방문하는 것이 좋다는 말을 듣고 실망하지 않았습니다. 갑자기 내린 눈이 크리스마스 분위기를 한층 고조시켰다. 경사가 급한 오르막이 있어 운동을 많이 하지 않는 사람에게는 상당히 피곤했습니다. 엘리베이터를 타고 26초 만에 탑 꼭대기에 도달하면 야경을 보고 기념품 가게를 방문하는 것 외에는 할 일이 별로 없습니다.
1062,1062,406,4749,"The tower can be planned as part of your visit if you have covered most of the places in Seoul since apart from the view from top there is nothing much. Since the top of the tower is closed with glass enclosure (unlike in say, Eiffel tower ) you feel a bit disconnected from the view.  To reach the tower you will have to walk around half KM from nearest bus stop and metro.  You can either walk all the way to the top, which can be bit taxing. Or take the option that I took, of taking cable car from mid way of the hill to the tower.  Do note that cable car entry may become crowded and will require you to wait for getting your turn.  Once in the tower complex you need to collect ticket for going to top of the tower in lift. View from is great, though you get a feeling that they have tried a bit to replicate Eiffel tower.  Best would be to visit in evening so that you can view the town before sun set and after dark.",1062,much,탑은 꼭대기에서 보는 것 외에는 아무것도 없기 때문에 서울의 대부분의 장소를 다뤘다면 방문의 일부로 계획할 수 있습니다. 탑의 꼭대기는 유리 인클로저로 닫혀 있기 때문에 (에펠 탑과 달리)보기에서 약간 분리 된 느낌이 듭니다. 타워에 도달하려면 가장 가까운 버스 정류장과 지하철에서 약 0.5km를 걸어야 합니다. 조금 힘들 수 있는 정상까지 걸어갈 수도 있습니다. 또는 내가 선택한 옵션을 선택하여 언덕 중간에서 타워까지 케이블카를 타십시오. 케이블카 입장은 혼잡할 수 있으며 차례를 기다려야 합니다. 타워 단지에 도착하면 리프트를 타고 타워 꼭대기로 올라가는 티켓을 받아야 합니다. 보기는 훌륭하지만 에펠 탑을 복제하기 위해 조금 노력했다는 느낌을 받습니다. 해가 지기 전과 어두워진 후에 마을을 볼 수 있도록 저녁에 방문하는 것이 가장 좋습니다.
1063,1063,407,4773,"Seoul N Tower has a great view of the old city center if the weather is clear like in Autumn. The tower is already located on a mountain. Hence, there's no need to go up to the top of the tower to see any better view since it is pretty much the same on the ground level. Lovers' lockers are crazy all around the safety barriers. It used to be more beautiful, but it became too much of it everywhere. Nothing much unless you are so romantic to add yours.  I personally recommend everyone to take a cable to go up because only cable cars, yellow public shuttles and climbing are possible. Private cars and cabs are not allowed in the mountain. When you go back to the city, I recommend to walk down as it is quite easy walk for about an hour and has a good view point on the way. Personally, I'd say night view seems way better than day one.",1063,much,"서울 N타워는 가을처럼 날씨가 맑으면 구시가지가 한눈에 들어온다. 타워는 이미 산 위에 있습니다. 따라서 지상에서 거의 동일하기 때문에 더 나은 전망을 보기 위해 타워의 꼭대기까지 올라갈 필요가 없습니다. 연인의 사물함은 안전 장벽 주위에 미친 듯이 있습니다. 예전에는 더 아름다웠지만 여기저기서 너무 많아졌습니다. 당신이 당신의 것을 추가하기에 너무 낭만적이지 않는 한별로 아무것도 없습니다. 저는 개인적으로 케이블카, 노란색 공공셔틀, 등산만 가능하기 때문에 모두 케이블타고 오를 것을 추천합니다. 개인 차량과 택시는 산에 들어갈 수 없습니다. 시내로 돌아오면 1시간 정도 꽤 걸을 수 있고 가는 길에 전망이 좋은 곳이라 걸어서 내려가는 것을 추천한다. 개인적으로 나는 야경이 첫날보다 훨씬 나은 것 같다고 말하고 싶다."

Due to the cold season, the peak was a little foggy. The scenery will be much nicer if it is spring or summer. Don't forget to bring along marker and a padlock to lock your love messages. Though you can always purchase them at the sourvenirs shop but at an escalated price. We spent around 2hrs on top and really enjoyed the nice scenery and the fresh air. There are a few eateries and cafes so no worries about where to get drinks and food. I must say that this place is a must go when you're in Seoul.

N Grill 레스토랑은 합리적인 서비스를 제공했으며 직원들은 세심하고 정중했습니다. 음식은 괜찮 았고 위치와 전망은 판매 포인트입니다. 음식이 그 높이에 도달하지 못한 것이 조금 아쉽습니다."

The tower and observation deck are at the top of a hill in the middle of the city. You can climb the hill by car, using the stairs and enjoy the greenery. My favorite way: the cable car. At the top, you have many options: cafes, a museum, souvenir shops, a wall where couples put padlocks with their names or any promise, and much more. It is definitely a romantic place but has a lot to offer if you come with family or alone. There is a good restaurant up in the tower, serving French and international cuisine, that I personally recommend, the food is up to par and the views are great. It is an excellent and romantic option for a dinner with that special someone.",1067,much,"낮이든 밤이든 서울에 처음 오든 오랜 친구이든 상관없이 놀라운 전망을 가진 곳입니다! 타워와 전망대는 도심 한가운데 있는 언덕 꼭대기에 있습니다. 자동차로 언덕을 오르면 계단을 이용하여 녹음을 즐길 수 있습니다. 내가 가장 좋아하는 방법: 케이블카. 상단에는 카페, 박물관, 기념품 가게, 커플이 이름이나 약속이 적힌 자물쇠를 걸어두는 벽 등 다양한 옵션이 있습니다. 확실히 낭만적 인 장소이지만 가족과 함께 또는 혼자 오는 경우 제공 할 것이 많습니다. 타워에는 프랑스 요리와 세계 각국의 요리를 제공하는 훌륭한 레스토랑이 있습니다. 개인적으로 추천하는 음식은 수준급이며 전망은 훌륭합니다. 특별한 사람과의 저녁 식사를 위한 훌륭하고 낭만적인 옵션입니다."
1068,1068,412,4827,"I had initially intended on taking a bus to the tower, however somehow I got lost and there was no obvious stop at the bottom of the road up to the tower. So I ended up hiking the 3km trail to the top in the middle of July - if you do this make sure you bring lots of water as it is both hot and humid!  The hike itself was really nice, and there were many different flowers and trees bordering the trail. Unfortunately, the view wasn't so spectacular since it was so humid and foggy the day that I went.  At the top, they definitely play up the love theme with heart flower arrangements, the chance to buy lover's locks (if you didn't bring your own) and attach it to the lock trees, and the benches are slanted inwards so that you sit closer to your loved one. I went to the restaurant on the main floor which was a bit pricey (also decided going up wasn't worth the $$ since you already can see out at the main level).  I think that other times during the year (Spring or Fall when it isn't so muggy) the view would be much nicer, or even at night when the tower is lit up. Regardless though, it still was an enjoyable attraction that CAN be free if you hike to the top and forego the extra lift to the top.",1068,much,"나는 처음에 타워까지 버스를 탈 생각이었지만 어떻게든 길을 잃어 타워까지 가는 길의 바닥에 뚜렷한 정류장이 없었습니다. 그래서 저는 7월 중순에 정상까지 3km의 트레일을 하이킹하게 되었습니다. 이렇게 하면 덥고 습하기 때문에 물을 많이 가져와야 합니다! 하이킹 자체는 정말 좋았고 트레일을 경계로 많은 다른 꽃과 나무가있었습니다. 아쉽게도 내가 간 날은 너무 습하고 안개가 껴서 전망이 그렇게 훌륭하지는 않았다. 상단에는 하트 꽃꽂이, 연인의 자물쇠를 사서 자물쇠 나무에 부착 할 수있는 기회 (당신이 앉을 수 있도록 벤치가 안쪽으로 기울어 져 있음)로 확실히 사랑 테마를 연주합니다. 사랑하는 사람에게 더 가까이. 나는 약간 비쌌던 주층에 있는 레스토랑에 갔다(또한 당신이 이미 주 층에서 볼 수 있기 때문에 올라가는 것이 $$의 가치가 없다고 결정했다). 나는 일년 중 다른 시간(그렇게 후덥지 않은 봄이나 가을) 또는 타워에 불이 들어오는 밤에 훨씬 더 멋질 것이라고 생각합니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 정상까지 하이킹을 하고 정상까지의 추가 리프트를 피하면 무료로 즐길 수 있는 즐거운 명소였습니다."

I am wary of city towers because of the crowds but N Seoul was not too busy when I got there and maybe better organized than many similar structures. The view was stunning, but I actually enjoyed the fun atmosphere with people taking selfies, just hanging out or ogling the famous love padlocks area below. It is a popular stop for most Seoul visitors with good reason. On a sunny day photos do come out very well. The food options here are not great but serviceable enough with burgers and fast food. The souvenir shops are nice and service efficient. The ride up Namsan was quite good. I appreciated the fact that Seoul is still pretty much a hilly kind of city, and you are never too far from nature and lots of greenery. N Seoul Tower and Namsan can be a pleasant change of pace from the furious shopping most do when visiting the city.",1070,much,N 서울 타워의 두 번째 방문은 실제로 경치를 보기 위해 올라갔기 때문에 첫 번째 방문보다 더 좋았습니다. 나는 군중 때문에 시티 타워를 경계하지만 N Seoul은 내가 거기에 도착했을 때 너무 바쁘지 않았고 아마도 많은 유사한 구조보다 더 잘 조직화되었을 것입니다. 보기는 훌륭했지만 사람들이 셀카를 찍는 재미있는 분위기를 즐겼습니다. 그냥 어울리거나 아래의 유명한 사랑의 자물쇠 지역을 훑어보는 것입니다. 대부분의 서울 방문객들에게 인기 있는 명소인 데에는 그럴만한 이유가 있습니다. 맑은 날에는 사진이 아주 잘 나옵니다. 여기 음식 옵션은 훌륭하지는 않지만 햄버거와 패스트 푸드로 충분히 서비스 가능합니다. 기념품 가게는 훌륭하고 서비스 효율적입니다. 남산을 오르는 길은 꽤 괜찮았다. 나는 서울이 여전히 언덕이 많은 도시이고 자연과 많은 녹지에서 결코 멀지 않다는 사실에 감사했습니다. N서울타워와 남산은 도시를 방문할 때 가장 많이 하는 분주한 쇼핑에서 기분 좋은 전환점이 될 수 있습니다.

The reality, however; left much to be desired.  1. the line: there was a huge line to buy tickets, and to wait for the lift, and again to come back down the mountain, mostly by local tourists and chinese tourists who come as groups or individually. a wildly popular korean drama had some scenes here, so i suppose that's the main reason for the upsurge in popularity. i came here with my girlfriend late at night, around 9PM (the lifts close at ten), hoping to avoid the crowds, but still managed to wait for over an hour all together to go up and come down. We spent no more than 15 min on the top.  2. the prices were expensive, you pay for the cable car, as well as the elevator in the tower, which is only 200 something meters, furthermore, the Seoul skyline isn't all that attractive to be honest, don't get me wrong, i love the city's youthful energy and friendly people, its just that as a city, it is nowhere near NYC, HK, Shanghai, or Paris in terms of grandeur or overall aesthetic effect on the eye.

I faced about an hour's wait to go into the lift to bring the visitors up the observatory. I don't mind the wait, but there were not enough seats or rest areas for people who were waiting. Some, just made themselves comfortable on the floor. For me, i found an air con draft and stood at the same spot for almost 1 hour. Note: If you are coming by bus, there is a steep hill for you to conquer, so advisable to have comfortable walking shoes on.  (Wait is over.. or is it...)

Crowds get into your face sometimes. Some will hog the glass panels and rest themselves at the panels / selfies etc. so STAY CALM.. and wait or walk around before coming back. They have the signs that will point in the direction of you hometown, stating the distance you are away from home. There is a mailbox at the souvenir shop. Apparently, it's the 'highest' postbox or something. Many people were trying to send postcards (purchased from the shop) back home to their loved ones. Do have a pen with you if you intend on doing so.  (Final comments) Interesting experience, but my wait and travel is much longer than the time i spend there.

The second I went was around Chuseok September 2012. A bit quieter since it was around the holidays, but they had traditional crafts and such. The third time I went was January 2013.

1081,1081,425,4916,"I went to the The N Seoul Tower with the simple intention of viewing the urban sprawl from the observation deck above, but it was its famous collection of 'love locks' below that roused my senses the most.  I’d read about the locks in my guidebook but it simply described the sight as being ‘trees’ covered with padlocks which symbolise eternal love. I knew to expect a few of these trees, but much to my surprise, I was greeted with an entire kaleidoscopic fence full of padlocks, key rings, phone cases, tags, hearts and toys - there was such an array of dazzling paraphernalia attached to the railings!  I spent nearly an hour taking in the sight before me, reading through the many names & notes appearing on the locks. Some of the messages were concise & to the point; others had a lifetime of thought & emotion put into them; all amounted to an astonishing display of collective happiness in the form of symbolic expression.  As for the view from the top of the tower? Well, it was pretty neat, but a little too smoggy to be considered spectacular. The monochrome picture from the heavens didn’t quite match the vividity of the scene below.  Promise me you visit the love locks if you ever find yourself at N Seoul Tower!  Perhaps you can even fasten one to the fence yourself?",1081,much,"나는 위의 전망대에서 도시의 불규칙한 모습을 보기 위한 단순한 의도로 The N 서울 타워에 갔지만, 가장 내 감각을 자극한 것은 아래에 있는 '러브 락'의 유명한 컬렉션이었다. 나는 가이드북에서 자물쇠에 대해 읽었지만 영원한 사랑을 상징하는 자물쇠로 덮인 '나무'로 그 광경을 묘사했습니다. 나는 이 나무들 중 몇 그루를 기대하고 있었지만 훨씬 더 놀랍게도 자물쇠, 열쇠 고리, 전화 케이스, 꼬리표, 하트, 장난감으로 가득 찬 만화경 울타리 전체를 맞이했습니다. 난간! 나는 자물쇠에 나타나는 많은 이름과 메모를 읽으면서 거의 한 시간을 내 앞의 광경을 바라보는 데 보냈습니다. 메시지 중 일부는 간결하고 요점에 충실했습니다. 다른 사람들은 일생 동안 생각과 감정을 쏟아부었습니다. 모두 상징적 표현의 형태로 집단적 행복을 놀랍게 표현한 것이었습니다. 타워 위에서 바라보는 전망은? 글쎄, 그것은 꽤 깔끔했지만 장관으로 간주되기에는 약간 너무 연기가 자욱했습니다. 하늘에서 찍은 흑백 사진은 아래 장면의 선명도와 어울리지 않았습니다.

You may also take a bus or cable car to go there.  If you take a bus, you will have to walk uphill bout 10 minutes (depends). Other attractions nearby, such as Alive Museum and famous love-locks place are worth visiting if you have extra time to spend. You'll have to buy the ticket before proceeds to observation deck.  Basic costs: Heart love-lock set: KRW12000 (split two with my friend so KRW6000 each) Seoul morning tour bus: KRW10000 (you may hop in and off at most Seoul's attractions until 7 pm) Admission ticket for adult: approx. KRW15000 (observatory deck + Alive Museum) Sending postcard from observation deck: approx. KRW1000++ with stamp  It's such a nice place for photo sessions (despite it was really windy when we went there). The love-lock thing is so fun to do, and the view of Seoul from observation deck is just mesmerizing. I heard it is much fun at night, but I prefer morning as the view is clearer.

The view is nice, I admit, but you don't even need to go to the top of the tower for the view. The prices are also outrageous. This is to be expected, considering as how touristy it is, but it's not worth it.  You will pay about $9 per person just to go up the tower. Of course, you have to get to the tower first, which can vary in price and time, depending on if you take a bus, the (expensive) lift system or walk the whole way (not recommended unless you have a lot of time in Seoul). The food at the top is also expensive, so eat in advance, or bring snacks during your time at the tower.  I recommend taking a hike on one of the mountains in Seoul instead. It is a great way to get some exercise, spend some time with your friends or family, and the view is much better. Trust me. You will appreciate the scenery much more on the mountains.

We were fortunate to see Seoul during daylight on the way up and then stuck around until sundown to go back down - I would recommend doing the same but be prepared for a crowd.

Apparently those who went up hang around (with the steep price, I can understand why) and it was hard to properly enjoy the view. I went there while the sun was setting and it was nice to see the sunset hues and then quickly turning dark (it was winter time). It was a good way to appreciate the city though ...

It really depends when you go. I took the cable car at night around 8pm, i didn't need to wait that long. I think maybe around 10~15mins time. The cable car is a bit pricey i thought but its an experience and most tourist will never know until they took it. Alternatively, you can take the bus there at a much lower cost.  I think one of the attractions was the safe/lock thing where many couples, friends and family (me included) purchased a lock and lock there. Of course some would say its not worth it and stuff like that but what I can tell you is that it really depends what your looking for. For me, i do it as an experience and memory so i think its worth it. Even if you don't purchase a lock and lock it there, its an experience to see how many people visited Seoul.

Sunsets over the city of Seoul are beautiful and Seoul light up at night is a sight not to miss. Keep in mind visiting the tower can be a bit spendy. There is a fee just to go up in the tower and all the food and souvenirs are overpriced.

1113,1113,457,5228,"Often in a new city, I do take the effort to visit towers or tall buildings with observation decks given my line of work. I don't often enjoy them given how most of these visits are often crammed full with tourists, usually over-priced, and due to the nature of having to move vertically - you have to endure packed elevators on top of the lines. Still, I do make the effort if I have the time and there are the occasional highlights - plus some cities really look so much better from up high.  The N Seoul Tower in Seoul, South Korea is definitely one of the pluses in my book. Although in terms of infrastructure there really isn't anything remarkably different about the N Seoul Tower, I definitely enjoyed my visit there and count it as among the highlights of my week long Seoul adventure.  One of the major attractions of the N Seoul Tower is its location atop the scenic Namsan mountain in the centre of the city. The tower is fringed by nature and the absence of cars gives the space a certain serenity that's marred only by the shuttle buses that ply the route up. It's definitely worthwhile making your way here just to enjoy the view from the base of the tower, soaking in nature's splendour and enjoying an ice cream from one of the many retailers here. I was here in Spring so the weather was crisp, cool and really almost perfect.  The N Seoul Tower has a unique positioning as the place for love with many love-smitten folks hanging padlocks declaring their everlasting bonds on structures and fences at the base. It makes for some pretty ornaments (albeit expensive ones) but really, this notion of public testaments of love seems pretty tacky. Plus the whole idea of a padlock reminds me more of a prison than love but hey, that's my opinion entirely.  The good thing about the 'love connection' here at the tower is that it lends the whole space a whole lot more charm and appeal. And the management of the place obviously knows this and uses this to their benefit well what with couple benches and love-themed souvenirs. Towers and tall buildings can be sterile and industrial so this lovey-dovey angle is really a compelling angle to have.  As compelling as the site is, the star of course is the tower itself. The N Seoul Tower has a few observatory levels including two restaurants. I only did the views so can't comment on the dining options up high. Tickets are not as pricy as some other towers starting at around RM24 (USD8) which is really pretty decent. There's a combo ticket option which gives you entry to the Teddy Bear Museum also located onsite which I highly recommend.  The tower visit itself is fairly generic. You have a fancy elevator ride up that's decked out with multimedia (this time on the elevator roof). The observatory levels offer great views and there are retail outlets too offering gifts and snacks. One nice addition is the opportunity to send a postcard overseas from the little 'postal office' there. I also liked how they indicated the distance to other major Asian cities on the glass windows based on the direction you are facing. I can see many tourists looking for 'home' and I did too.  So if you ever find yourself in Seoul, do check out the N Seoul Tower. If you do a relaxed visit with a meal, the Teddy Bear Museum and a walk around the site thrown in, it's a good half day at least. Check out the main website for access information and hours and I've heard that the night view is stunning. Definitely a site I will recommend.",1113,much,"종종 새로운 도시에서 나는 내 업무 라인에 따라 전망대가 있는 고층 빌딩이나 타워를 방문하려고 노력합니다. 나는 이러한 방문의 대부분이 일반적으로 비싼 가격에 관광객으로 가득 찬 경우가 많고 수직으로 움직여야 하는 특성으로 인해 줄 위에서 붐비는 엘리베이터를 견뎌야 한다는 점을 감안할 때 자주 방문하지 않습니다. 그래도 시간이 있고 가끔 하이라이트가 있는 경우에는 노력을 기울이고 있습니다. 게다가 일부 도시는 위에서 보면 훨씬 더 좋아 보입니다. 한국 서울의 N 서울 타워는 확실히 내 책의 장점 중 하나입니다. 인프라 측면에서 N 서울 타워와 크게 다른 점은 없지만 나는 그곳을 확실히 즐겼고 일주일 동안의 서울 모험의 하이라이트 중 하나로 여기고 있습니다. N서울타워의 가장 큰 매력 중 하나는 도심 한가운데 있는 아름다운 남산 정상에 위치한다는 것입니다. 타워는 자연에 둘러싸여 있으며 차가 없는 공간은 경로를 운행하는 셔틀 버스에 의해서만 손상되는 특정 고요함을 제공합니다. 타워 기슭에서 경치를 즐기고 자연의 아름다움에 몸을 담그고 여기에 있는 많은 소매점 중 한 곳에서 아이스크림을 즐기기 위해 이곳으로 가는 것은 확실히 가치가 있습니다. 나는 봄에 여기에 갔기 때문에 날씨는 파삭 파삭하고 시원하며 거의 완벽했습니다. N 서울 타워는 사랑에 빠진 많은 사람들이 기지의 구조물과 울타리에 영원한 유대를 선언하는 자물쇠를 걸고 있는 사랑의 장소라는 독특한 위치를 가지고 있습니다. 그것은 (비싼 장식품이기는 하지만) 예쁜 장식품을 만들기는 하지만, 사실, 사랑에 대한 공개적인 증거에 대한 이 개념은 꽤 촌스러워 보입니다. 게다가 자물쇠에 대한 모든 아이디어는 사랑보다 감옥을 더 생각나게 하지만 이봐, 그건 전적으로 내 생각이야. 여기 타워의 '사랑의 연결'의 좋은 점은 전체 공간을 훨씬 더 매력과 매력을 부여한다는 것입니다. 그리고 장소의 관리는 이것을 분명히 알고 커플 벤치와 사랑 테마 기념품으로 무엇을 잘 활용합니다. 타워와 고층 건물은 메마르고 산업적일 수 있으므로 이 사랑스러운 각도는 정말 매력적인 각도입니다. 사이트가 매력적이기는 하지만 스타는 물론 타워 자체입니다. N 서울 타워에는 2개의 레스토랑을 포함한 몇 개의 전망대가 있습니다. 나는 단지 전망을 보았으므로 높은 식사 옵션에 대해 언급 할 수 없습니다. 티켓은 약 RM24(USD8)에서 시작하는 다른 타워만큼 비싸지 않습니다. 현장에 있는 테디베어 박물관에 입장할 수 있는 콤보 티켓 옵션이 있어 적극 추천합니다. 타워 방문 ​​자체는 상당히 일반적입니다. 멀티미디어로 장식된 멋진 엘리베이터가 있습니다(이번에는 엘리베이터 지붕에서). 전망대 층은 멋진 전망을 제공하며 선물과 스낵을 제공하는 소매점도 있습니다. 좋은 추가 기능 중 하나는 그곳의 작은 '우체국'에서 엽서를 해외로 보낼 수 있는 기회입니다. 바라보는 방향에 따라 유리창으로 아시아 주요 도시까지의 거리를 표시해주는 점도 마음에 들었다. 나는 많은 관광객들이 '집'을 찾는 것을 볼 수 있고 나도 그랬다. 따라서 서울에 계시다면 N 서울 타워를 확인하십시오. 식사와 테디베어 뮤지엄, 던진 현장을 산책하며 여유롭게 방문한다면 적어도 반나절은 충분하다. 주요 웹사이트에서 액세스 정보 및 시간을 확인하고 야경이 멋지다고 들었습니다. 확실히 제가 추천하는 사이트입니다."

It's good enough for you to stay at the base of the tower, and the open air environment feels nice at night. Nothing much to do though, aside from eating or looking at the view.  The top of the tower is a bit so-so. It's not that significantly higher imo. You don't get to feel the height either as there are no glass floors for you to look down.

The Korean culture as seen on the tower interested me. They have trees with padlocks and padlocks on the perimeters of the tower.

1117,1117,461,5250,"You have to be extremely determined to get to the top of this tower. There’s no quick and easy way. A city tour bus stops here – the hop on hop off type. Local buses venture up, and my guide book says that taxis carrying foreign tourists can drive up. There’s also a cable car but that’s no quick and easy trip either. The base of the cable car has no nearby metro and it’s a climb just to get there. On my way down I did see some shuttle buses but as a tourist, good look with finding out where they go to. There’s a rail car which covers part of the way from the base station to the street level.  Anyway, back to the tower. When you get off your bus, you’re still faced with a steep climb to the tower. Fatties beware. You buy your ticket then you look round for signs where to go and see none, so naturally you head to the base of the tower and inside you do a complete circuit past numerous cafes etc and see a lift. Then you’re told that this is not the lift up. The man points to a public phone across a pathway outside and a small alleyway behind it. You look for the signs and still see none. Not any in English anyway. The pathway leads you in to a building with various entertainments and you still find yourself looking around and having to ask where the lift is. Eventually, at some point in your life, you get to the top of the tower.  The view is ok. During my 9 day stay I went up on what was probably the clearest sunniest day and it was still very hazy. There were no distant views to be enjoyed. As always, I venture up these towers mid to late afternoon for daytime photos and stay until after dark for night shots. Seoul didn’t really come to life and light up very much. Not like say Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shanghai and Sydney. It was disappointing. From a photographic point of view, the cleanliness of the windows was good.  Now the descent. I chose to use the cable car. By the time you’ve walked down the multitude of steps to discover the huge queue, you’re unlikely to feel like climbing all the way back up to get a bus down. So you join the queue and during that time you’re expecting to come across a ticket booth, or pay on entry thing. Not quite. By the time you get to a point close to boarding you see that almost everybody has already got a ticket by some means, Your option is to exit the queue and buy a ticket form the vending machine at point of boarding. While you are trying to work out how to use the non-English machine, 50 people who were behind you are now in front and filling up that single slow-moving cable car. If you’re quick and lucky you just manage to get in that car as I did without having to wait 10 minutes for the next one.  At the base station it’s a case of wandering around and deciding on the options. You’re still fairly high up. There are steps down to street level, and as mentioned earlier, a rail car. Some of the non-English speaking tourists found a bay with shuttle buses, went to investigate, then returned to the rail car where I was, having been unable to find out which buses went where. Once you’re back on the street it’s about a 20 minute walk to a metro station. And you’re still going downhill.  So, as I said at the beginning, you have to be extremely determined to venture up this tower.",1117,much,"이 탑의 꼭대기에 오르려면 극도로 결단을 내려야 합니다. 빠르고 쉬운 방법은 없습니다. 시티 투어 버스는 여기에서 정차합니다 – 홉 온 홉 오프 타입. 시내버스가 올라가는데 제 가이드북에는 외국인 관광객을 태운 택시가 올라올 수 있다고 나와 있습니다. 케이블카도 있지만 빠르고 쉬운 여행은 아닙니다. 케이블카의 기슭에는 근처에 지하철이 없으며 거기에 도착하기 위해 오르막입니다. 내려가는 길에 셔틀버스를 몇 대 보았지만 관광객으로서 그들이 어디로 가는지 알아가는 것이 좋습니다. 베이스 스테이션에서 거리 수준까지의 일부를 커버하는 철도 차량이 있습니다. 어쨌든 타워로 돌아갑니다. 버스에서 내리면 여전히 가파른 탑을 올라야 합니다. 지방이 조심하십시오. 티켓을 구입한 다음 어디로 가야 하는지 이정표를 찾아보고 아무 것도 볼 수 없습니다. 그래서 자연스럽게 타워 바닥으로 향하고 내부에서 수많은 카페 등을 지나 완전한 순환을 하고 리프트를 봅니다. 그런 다음 이것은 리프트 업이 아니라고 말합니다. 남자는 밖 통로와 그 뒤에 있는 작은 골목을 가로질러 공중전화를 가리켰다. 당신은 징후를 찾고 여전히 아무것도 볼 수 없습니다. 어쨌든 영어에는 없습니다. 통로는 다양한 엔터테인먼트가 있는 건물로 안내하며 여전히 주위를 둘러보고 엘리베이터가 어디에 있는지 물어야 합니다. 결국, 인생의 어느 시점에서, 당신은 탑의 꼭대기에 도착합니다. 보기는 괜찮습니다. 9일 동안 머무르는 동안 나는 아마도 가장 맑은 날에 올라갔지만 여전히 매우 흐릿했습니다. 즐길 거리가 멀었다. 늘 그렇듯이 저는 낮 사진을 찍기 위해 오후 중반에서 늦은 오후까지 이 타워에 올라가서 밤 사진을 찍기 위해 어두워질 때까지 머물렀습니다. 서울은 실제로 살아나지 않았고 많이 밝아지지 않았습니다. 홍콩, 도쿄, 상하이, 시드니와는 다릅니다. 실망스러웠다. 사진상으로 봤을때 창가의 청결도는 좋았습니다. 이제 내리막길. 나는 케이블카를 이용하기로 했다. 거대한 대기열을 발견하기 위해 수많은 계단을 걸어 내려갈 때쯤이면 버스를 내리기 위해 다시 끝까지 올라가고 싶은 기분이 들지 않을 것입니다. 그래서 당신은 대기열에 합류하고 그 시간 동안 매표소를 찾거나 입장료를 지불할 것으로 예상합니다. 좀 빠지는. 탑승에 가까운 지점에 도착할 때쯤이면 거의 모든 사람들이 어떤 방식으로든 이미 티켓을 얻었음을 알 수 있습니다. 당신의 선택은 대기열에서 나와 탑승 지점의 자동 판매기에서 티켓을 구매하는 것입니다. 당신이 비영어권 기계를 어떻게 사용할지 고민하는 동안, 당신 뒤에 있던 50명의 사람들이 이제 앞에 서서 천천히 움직이는 그 한 대의 케이블카를 채우고 있습니다. 당신이 빠르고 운이 좋다면 당신은 다음 차를 위해 10분을 기다릴 필요 없이 저처럼 그 차에 탈 수 있습니다. 기지국에서는 이리저리 방황하고 옵션을 결정하는 경우입니다. 당신은 여전히 ​​​​높은 위치에 있습니다. 거리 수준으로 내려가는 계단이 있으며 앞서 언급했듯이 철도 차량이 있습니다. 비영어권 관광객 중 일부는 셔틀 버스가 있는 만을 발견하고 조사를 하러 갔다가, 어느 버스가 어디로 갔는지 찾지 못한 채 내가 있는 철도 차량으로 돌아왔습니다. 거리로 돌아오면 지하철역까지 도보로 약 20분이 소요됩니다. 그리고 당신은 여전히 ​​내리막길을 걷고 있습니다. 그래서 처음에 말했듯이 이 탑을 오르기 위해서는 극도로 결단력이 있어야 합니다."

1120,1120,464,5270,"Missed this attraction fm my last trip so was very determined to go this round. We were misinformed at the concierge of our hotel that this place is walkable from the hotel!! I should have stucked to my own research findings and not trust the reception. Although a short walk, getting to the cable station was a sharp steep walk. Was totally out of breath when we reached the station! The best way to get there is by taxi as it won't cost a lot. It will save you a lot of leg power. If you really want to walk, we found out too late there is a much easier way. I don't have the road names ready but I will try to give adequate directions. From Myeondong shopping are, head towards Migliore dept store and turn right on the main road. Think is is called Namsan-dong. Walk towards Shinsaegae dept store (near Namdaemun market). Before reaching Shinsaegae, turn left (a big road so you can't miss it). Walk on for 5 minutes (uphill) and you will come to a lift (special lift just to bring passengers up to Namsan Cable car station. It is free and is so easy rather than walking uphill like what we did...at the cable car station, a return ticket is KRW8,000 per pax. Need a 10 min wait for each cable car to arrive. It was worth the wait as we got down at the foot of N-Seoul Tower. Plenty of activities as there were some shows going on, changing of guards? Can take pictures with the guards. After a few flight of steps, you will be at the big courtyard where you can buy tickets up to the observatory deck or go into the restaurants in the tower. We wondered around the open areas and were fascinated with the many colourful locks (for sweethearts) and couple seats...you need to see this and try it out...cool. The shops on the ground floor are so pretty and captivating that we forgot all about going up the observatory deck (KRW9,000 entrance fees) and shopped there for nearly 45 minutes, choosing all the cute stuff sold there.

N-서울 타워 기슭에 내려서 기다릴만한 가치가 있었습니다. 쇼 진행, 경비원 교대식? 경비원들과 사진도 찍을 수 있고 몇 걸음만 걸어가면 큰 안뜰이 나오는데 이곳에서 전망대까지 가는 표를 사거나 타워에 있는 레스토랑에 들어갈 수 있다. 열린 공간 주변에 있었고 많은 다채로운 자물쇠(연인을 위한)와 커플 좌석에 매료되었습니다...이것은 보고 시도 해야 합니다...멋지다. 전망대 올라가는 모든 것(입장료 9,000원) 45분 가까이 쇼핑, choosi 거기에서 판매되는 모든 귀여운 것들. 대체로 힘든 산보에도 불구하고 우리 동안 가치가있었습니다."

But you get a feel for the entire city from the above, which is quite special.  The height of the tower itself is actually much less than CN Tower. Much of the elevation comes from the mountain. There are some shops, cafes and restaurants near the tower entrance, but I would not recommend. When we went on top, Seoul was all white with snow, which was quite a sight.  After coming down from the tower, we headed to Grand Hyatt nearby (10 minutes by car), which had a very lively night scene with a fabulous lobby.

That was a stroke of luck as we didn't know about the bus (not mentioned in the guidebook that we had).  As we arrive at the Tower in the late afternoon, we get to see Seoul in the day and after dinner, in the night, which was fantastic. For dinner, highly recommend the HanCook korean restaurant. Although it is a bit expensive, the buffet is relatively good and you get to enjoy the views without the tour groups and crowds (it is only one floor below the main observation deck). For even better deals, purchase the observatory/Hancook combo ticket. It provides some savings than if you pay separately.  Overall, a good place to view a panorama of Seoul city, though it will depend very much on the weather when you are there.",1127,much,우리는 케이블카를 타고 타워로 갔다. 명동역 3번 출구에서 우리를 케이블카 정류장까지 무료로 데려다주는 남산 셔틀 버스를 우연히 만났습니다. 그것은 우리가 버스에 대해 알지 못했기 때문에 운이 좋았습니다 (우리가 가지고 있던 가이드 북에는 언급되지 않았습니다). 늦은 오후에 타워에 도착하면 낮에는 서울을 볼 수 있고 저녁 식사 후에는 밤에 볼 수 있어 정말 환상적이었습니다. 저녁 식사로는 HanCook 한식당을 적극 추천합니다. 가격이 조금 비싸긴 하지만 뷔페가 비교적 좋고 투어 단체나 인파 없이 전망을 즐길 수 있습니다(주 전망대에서 한 층 아래에 ​​있음). 더 좋은 거래를 원하시면 전망대/한쿡 콤보 티켓을 구매하세요. 별도로 지불하는 것보다 약간의 절약을 제공합니다. 전반적으로 서울의 파노라마를 보기에 좋은 장소이지만 그곳에 있을 때의 날씨에 따라 많이 달라집니다.
1128,1128,472,5354,"Getting to the Seoul Tower is something of an adventure in itself - I had no problem following the online directions to take the subway stop and walk through the commercial district past restaurants and things and take some stairs and walk along the street to the cable car, which was an interesting trip in itself. You can also get there by bus which would be preferable if you have a problem with heights.  Once the cable car lets you off, up on the mountain, you could walk over to the tower itself or you could explore the mountain, which has a big park and an outdoor pavilion area where they were doing some kind of cultural display when I was there, and who knows what else. There are also food vendors, coffee, and other stuff like that.  So far you could do all this for free, because you can just hike up the mountain if you want, and once there you don't have to pay for anything else unless you want to experience the observation decks or the restaurant in the tower itself. We decided to go ahead and pay to go up to the observation deck, because it doesn't really cost that much and it was a weekday so it wasn't very crowded. We didn't have to wait in line for anything, and we were able to easily take advantage of the bathrooms (which have amazing views and are very clean and nice) and the coffee shop and restaurant and so on that are on the observation levels. One thing we found out is that the restaurant is on a rotating level but the observation level does not rotate, so you can't just sit there and see the entire city like I thought I was going to do.  In summary, the views are amazing and definitely worth it even on a hazy day. Yes it can get a little touristy in there, and yes the prices at the coffee shop and so on are quite high, but it is a tourist attraction after all. I considered it to be worth the price of admission. I plan on going back on a clear day if possible to eat at the rotating restaurant just so I can enjoy the view of the whole city.",1128,much,"서울 타워에 도착하는 것은 그 자체로 일종의 모험입니다. 지하철 정류장을 타고 상업 지구를 지나 레스토랑과 물건을 지나 계단을 타고 거리를 따라 케이블카까지 걸어가는 온라인 지침을 따르는 데 문제가 없었습니다. 그 자체로 흥미로운 여행이었습니다. 높이에 문제가있는 경우 선호되는 버스로도 갈 수 있습니다. 케이블카를 타고 산 위로 올라가면 타워 자체로 걸어갈 수도 있고, 내가 어렸을 때 일종의 문화 전시를 하던 야외 정자와 큰 공원이 있는 산을 탐험할 수도 있습니다. 거기, 그리고 누가 또 무엇을 알고 있습니다. 식품 판매 업체, 커피 및 기타 유사한 것들도 있습니다. 지금까지는 이 모든 것을 무료로 할 수 있었습니다. 원하는 경우 산에 오르기만 하면 됩니다. 전망대에 오르거나 타워 자체에서 레스토랑을 경험하고 싶지 않다면 다른 비용을 지불할 필요가 없기 때문입니다. . 우리는 전망대에 가기 위해 돈을 지불하기로 결정했습니다. 비용이 그렇게 많이 들지 않고 평일이라 사람이 많이 붐비지 않았기 때문입니다. 우리는 줄을 서서 기다릴 필요가 없었고 전망이 훌륭하고 매우 깨끗하고 멋진 욕실과 전망대에 있는 커피숍, 레스토랑 등을 쉽게 이용할 수 있었습니다. . 우리가 알게 된 한 가지는 레스토랑이 회전하는 수준이지만 관찰 수준은 회전하지 않기 때문에 내가 할 것이라고 생각한 것처럼 거기에 앉아서 전체 도시를 볼 수 없다는 것입니다. 요약하면, 전망은 놀랍고 흐린 날에도 확실히 가치가 있습니다. 예, 거기에 약간의 touristy를 얻을 수 있습니다. 예, 커피 숍 등의 가격은 상당히 높지만 결국 관광 명소입니다. 입장료의 가치가 있다고 생각했습니다. 나는 가능하면 맑은 날에 돌아가서 도시 전체의 경치를 즐길 수 있도록 회전 레스토랑에서 식사를 할 계획입니다."

I recommend going in the late after noon when you can see the view of the city by day. You can then stay and enjoy a snack in the cafe and watch the sunset. You will be treated to an entirely different scene when you see the city light up for the evening. Go with someone who isn't in a rush, and who will appreciate the scenery with you. This is definitely worth doing once if you are in Korea for a year or more. Please be aware that there is an additional cost to go up to the viewing levels of the tower. Some friends had paid to take the cable car up to the tower grounds, but they then realized they had to by the additional cost to take the elevator up inside the tower. In my opinion, if you go all the way there, you have to go up inside the tower. The cost, whatever it was, did not seem much to me and was worth it.

Then the view from the top is (at least at night) largely obscured by the bright lights of the gift shop displays which are DIRECTLY behind all the windows. So you're essentially seeing glare, not the beautiful city lights. Big tourist trap too - lots of kitschy souvenirs and overpriced food.

Once up there, the view was incomparable - stunning. It didn't take long for our feet to start aching as there were so many people around and so few seats. When we were heading down, we had to wait in a long queue which made our feet ache even more. When we finally got down, we decided to take the cable car down as it is supposedly part of the tower experience. We had a very long wait as it was busy. Our aching feet didn't enjoy the wait either. There was nothing romantic about the cable car ride. We were jam packed in a cable car of at least 30 people. If i were to describe that experience, I'd say we felt like tunas/sardines in a can. I would tell future travelers to give it a miss and take the bus instead. It's cheaper and more convenient. Don't waste precious time waiting to be packed into a sardine can.

Oh, and the barricade is filled with those heavy locks with names of couples hoping to make it forever (just like the love bridge in Paris, but guess what? that broke, haha!). Maybe I'm just your typical American single girl who's jaded in all these cheesy things but marketing should be inclusive, not alienating.

Before I went there, I read many reviews of other travellers here, and they said you should be ready for long queue for the cable car. So I reached the cable car entrance amost 2 hrs in advance of my dinner booking. Out of my surprise, I did not need to queue at all, I just went there, bought the ticket, then I could go up to the entrance. I waited only for a few minutes, the cable came.  I thought that the cable car would be kind of individual cabinet, but it is not. It is a big one, no seats, able to accomodate 20-25 persons standing inside.  Cable car should be the best way to go to the Tower. I saw many people coming with big tour bus, and they needed to climb up to the hill. Anyway, after I had arrived, I saw many visitors, most of them are mainland Chinese, not very crowded, but noisy.  There are several gift shops and chain restaurants, but nothing special not buy, nor nothing good to eat here. You could take a lot of pictures with the ""love locks"" if you come with your another half.  There, you could buy the ticket to the observatory which is on the 3rd floor. I do not recommend it, though the elevator is interesting. Nothing much to see in the obvservatory. There are very few souvneirs shops, but trust me, the commodities are not interesting to buy though I was ready to, and intended to buy something.  But still, you could have a lunch / dinner at the korean restaurant.  There is also a chained coffee shop, called TWOSOME+, do not go. There is only one staff, so he is always busy and impatient. He might not be good at English, and when I ordered a drink in English, he misunderstood, and gave me another thing, I requested him to exchange, he became even more impatient and the atitudes were bad !  There is a wish pool right next to the coffee shop. I could hardly see something there. Who will throw money into such ""fake"" pool??????  After spending 1 hr on this boring 3rd floor, I went to the destination of this ride - 5th floor - N Grill (french restaurant), which was perfect in service and environment and food.  The view there is wonderful.  I recommend not to go up to this tower, unless you want to spend most time at N Grill. And if you go, it is better to be dinner time. The night view is fantastics.

It could be because there wasn't much to look out for when at the top. The view at every angle seemed the same to me. Perhaps it could be better if there was a guide pointing out the landmarks to spot when viewing from a certain part of the tower. The only prominent feature I could identify was probably the Han River.  There are also hourly light shows that will be beamed on the tower itself, starting from 8 pm. But honestly, you can skip it and head straight for the tower. It is nothing fanciful.  The place, like every tourist attraction, is full of people, and waiting time to get up to the viewing gallery can span up to 30 minutes (and that was when I visited on a weekday), so I suggest that you avoid weekends or public holidays, which in my opinion, will take even longer.  TIP: Tower admission fees are 9000 won for adults, but you can enjoy a 10% discount if you use the coupon provided when you purchase a Seoul City Pass Plus (their public transport card, but specially for foreigners) card.

I've been to many similar towers around the world, and they are all very similar to each other, with just different views. If you have not been in a tower like this, I would recommend it, however it is nothing special. It contains the usual features to try and coerce you into spending your money such as the group photos, gift shops and overpriced restaurants. The views are amazing though and I would recommend a visit if it is your first time. There is one special feature which are the locks on the fences, which are quite fun to do and look nice. The hike is also quite beautiful and great if you want to enjoy nature and fresh air. The cable car ride is also stunning and you can see amazing views. I would recommend going to the tower during the day time, where the view is clearer, whereas as night only the lights can be seen. I did go during sunset and the ride up the cable car was beautiful, and the views were absolutely amazing. This is dependent on the season, I went in winter, it was quite cold at night, and the bus rides down the mountain were limited. There are a few restaurants there, however I would not recommend them based on my personal experience. I went to the Korean buffet, and the food was not worth the price. The view was nice, however the food was below my expectations, and it was quite pricey as well. Overall I enjoyed my visit to the N Seoul Tower, however I think that one visit is enough.",1186,nothing,"N서울타워는 서울 시내의 멋진 전망을 자랑하지만 전형적인 관광 명소입니다. 나는 전 세계에서 비슷한 타워를 많이 가보았고, 그것들은 모두 서로 매우 유사하고 단지 다른 관점을 가지고 있습니다. 이런 타워에 가본 적이 없다면 추천하고 싶지만 특별한 것은 없습니다. 여기에는 단체 사진, 선물 가게, 비싼 식당과 같이 돈을 쓰도록 시도하고 강요하는 일반적인 기능이 포함되어 있습니다. 그러나 전망은 훌륭하고 처음이라면 방문을 추천합니다. 울타리에 자물쇠가 달린 특별한 기능이 하나 있는데, 이것은 하는 것이 아주 재미있고 멋지게 보입니다. 자연과 신선한 공기를 즐기고 싶다면 하이킹도 꽤 아름답고 좋습니다. 케이블카를 타는 것도 멋지고 멋진 전망을 볼 수 있습니다. 타워에 가는 것을 추천합니다. 낮에는 전망이 더 선명하지만 밤에는 조명만 볼 수 있습니다. 나는 일몰 시간에 갔고 케이블카를 타는 것은 아름다웠고 전망은 절대적으로 훌륭했습니다. 이것은 계절에 따라 다릅니다. 저는 겨울에 갔고 밤에는 꽤 추웠고 산을 내려가는 버스는 제한적이었습니다. 거기에 몇 개의 레스토랑이 있지만 제 개인적인 경험을 바탕으로 추천하고 싶지는 않습니다. 한식뷔페에 갔는데 음식이 가격대비 별로였어요. 보기는 좋았지 만 음식은 내 기대보다 낮았고 꽤 비쌌습니다. 전반적으로 나는 N 서울 타워 방문을 즐겼지만 한 번만 방문하면 충분하다고 생각합니다."

The ticketing iffice asked me to go down in exchange of ticket the other ones asked me to go up My pass expires and I can't get no ticket but with some rage in my face at least the ticketing office issued me Misunderstanding misleading and nothing special here Rode a cable car for a fee since its slippery and raining,1187,nothing,나는 Discover Seoul Pass에서 표를 교환하는 데 길을 잃었습니다. 실망 스러웠습니다. 서울에는 비가 왔지만 꼭 봐야한다고 나와있는 곳을보아야합니다. 나는 관광객이고 현지인들은 영어를 거의 할 수 없습니다. 매표소에서 표 대신 아래로 내려오라고 다른 사람들이 위로 올라오라고 함 여기 비와 미끄러워서 유료로 케이블카를 탔다.

1191,1191,56,2725,"There are 2 ways that I know of to get to the top. 1, is to walk up which can be quite taxing if your not quite fit enough, the other, is to catch the cable car. I have used both.  The queue for the cable car can be quite long, especially before sunset. Allow plenty of time for this.  Once at the top you will need to pay a fee for the tower itself. There are many of locations around the top where you can take some great shots of the city, but inside the tower itself, is where you really see Seoul for its beauty.  Buildings with a backdrop of mountains and cars which look like ants! Lots of useful information pointing to different cities around the world.  You really want to be up here when the sun is just about to go down. The views and colours are amazing so a camera is a must.  The food can be a bit expensive depending on where you eat, but nothing overly expensive. Shop around.  This should be your number one place to visit.",1191,nothing,"내가 아는 정상에 오르는 방법은 2가지가 있다. 1, 당신이 충분히 몸에 맞지 않으면 꽤 부담이 될 수 있는 걸어 올라가는 것이고, 다른 하나는 케이블카를 타는 것입니다. 나는 둘 다 사용했다. 케이블카의 대기열은 특히 일몰 전에 상당히 길 수 있습니다. 이를 위해 충분한 시간을 허용하십시오. 일단 정상에 오르면 타워 자체에 대한 요금을 지불해야 합니다. 정상 주변에는 도시의 멋진 사진을 찍을 수 있는 위치가 많이 있지만 타워 자체에서 서울의 아름다움을 제대로 볼 수 있습니다. 산을 배경으로 한 건물과 개미 같은 자동차! 전 세계의 여러 도시를 가리키는 유용한 정보가 많이 있습니다. 해가 막 지기 직전에 이곳에 올라가고 싶을 것입니다. 전망과 색상이 훌륭하므로 카메라는 필수입니다. 음식은 먹는 장소에 따라 약간 비쌀 수 있지만 지나치게 비싸지는 않습니다. 주변에 물색. 이것은 방문하는 최고의 장소이어야합니다."
1192,1192,57,2759,So the day that we went a family of 5 the two parents of five-year-old and two teenagers we took a taxi up to the cable car I recommend that as the best way to get to the N Tower. The cable car ride to the tower was jam-packed full so it's very hard to get your window to get good video so you might have to head your way strongly to get to the window to get some good video or pictures. The wait to get on the cable car was not very long so that was very well worth it. I think you can also walk up the hill and take all the steps to get to the in Tower which I would love to do on a nice spring or fall day not a rainy day like we went. Make sure you take a lot of padlock or some kind of lock to add to the locks at the top I forget what they're for but it's really a pretty cool it's a community or World Wide Arts peace you'll understand when you get there but take a log or Google it before you get there to know why you're taking a lot. There are several places to eat at the in Tower all ranges of prices ranging from probably 2 or 3 Bill signs 2425 Bill signs though so nothing really cheap but definitely a place to stop and eat if you want to have time it was crazy busy even on a rainy day. Once you're up in the tower they have names major cities like New York City is so many kilometers away excetera excetera which is pretty cool so you couldn't go all the way around the whole circle and take pictures with you or yourself and your family and with the cities that you've been to or the city that you're from. The little to shop up in the tower was wonderful and we thought the prices were very fair for some very unique gift ideas we opted for the little puzzle with the frame which happened to be on sale and they had multiple items on there like weekly or monthly cell so that was really. The candy store if it's still there was pretty cool also apart everything is impeccably clean and the candy is quite good although a little spendy but it's worth it. I would say if your only choice to go was during rainy weather then it absolutely still is a must go on but if you could go during clearweather then that would be the best although I'm sure that's also the busiest.,1192,nothing,그래서 5인가족 5인가족 2명과 5세 2명의 부모와 함께 갔던 날 케이블카까지 택시를 타고 N타워로 가는 가장 좋은 방법으로 추천합니다. 타워까지 가는 케이블카는 꽉 찼기 때문에 좋은 비디오를 얻기 위해 창문을 얻는 것이 매우 어렵습니다. 그래서 좋은 비디오나 사진을 얻기 위해 창문으로 가려면 힘차게 나아가야 할 수도 있습니다. 케이블카를 타기 위해 기다리는 시간은 그리 길지 않아서 그만한 가치가 있었습니다. 나는 당신이 언덕을 걸어 올라가기 위해 모든 단계를 밟을 수 있다고 생각합니다. 우리가 갔던 것처럼 비오는 날이 아닌 좋은 봄이나 가을 날에 하고 싶은 인 타워에 도착할 수 있습니다. 상단에 있는 자물쇠에 추가하려면 자물쇠나 자물쇠를 많이 가져가세요. 무엇을 위한 것인지 잊어버렸지만 정말 멋지네요. 그곳에 도착하면 이해할 수 있는 커뮤니티 또는 World Wide Arts의 평화입니다. 그러나 당신이 왜 많이 복용하는지 알기 위해 거기에 도착하기 전에 로그를 취하거나 구글에 그것을 가져 가라. 타워에는 먹을 곳이 여러 군데 있습니다. 아마도 2개 또는 3개의 Bill 표시에서 2425 Bill 표시에 이르기까지 모든 범위의 가격이 있지만 실제로 저렴한 것은 아니지만 시간을 갖고 싶다면 확실히 멈추고 먹을 수 있는 곳입니다. 비오는 날. 일단 타워에 오르면 뉴욕과 같은 주요 도시의 이름이 있습니다. excetera excetera는 너무 수 킬로미터 떨어져 있습니다. excetera excetera는 매우 시원하므로 전체 원을 돌아 다니며 귀하 또는 귀하와 귀하와 사진을 찍을 수 없습니다. 가족과 당신이 가본 도시 또는 당신이 왔던 도시. 타워에서 쇼핑할 작은 물건은 훌륭했고 우리는 가격이 매우 독특한 선물 아이디어에 대해 매우 공정하다고 생각했습니다. 우리는 우연히 판매 중인 프레임이 있는 작은 퍼즐을 선택했고 매주 또는 매월 같은 여러 항목을 가지고 있었습니다. 정말 그랬다. 사탕 가게가 여전히 있다면 아주 시원합니다. 모든 것이 흠 잡을 데없이 깨끗하고 사탕은 약간 비싸지 만 그만한 가치가 있습니다. 나는 당신이 갈 수 있는 유일한 선택이 비가 오는 날씨라면 절대적으로 계속해야 하지만 맑은 날씨에 갈 수 있다면 그것이 가장 바쁘다고 확신하지만 그것이 최고일 것이라고 말하고 싶습니다.
1193,1193,58,2760,"The place is perfect for love birds as it's full of signs of love !!  You have to walk a lot to reach to the main deck but once you reach on top the city view is very beautiful!!

1194,1194,59,2771,"Went during night time and it was packed with tourists and locals alike. It was freezing when we got to the top of the entrance. You get to experience 360 view of the city, though nothing spectacular. The queue to take the lift up the tower was long and once you are up there, you need to hustle with a lot of people who are trying to view the scenery all at the same time. Would also not recommend this if you can't take stairs as you still have to walk up a few flights of stairs to get to the entrance at the top even by taking the cable car up.",1194,nothing,밤시간대에 갔더니 현지인과 관광객들로 붐볐다. 우리가 입구의 꼭대기에 도착했을 때 그것은 추웠다. 장관은 아니지만 도시의 360도 전망을 경험할 수 있습니다. 타워에 올라가는 리프트를 타기 위한 줄이 길었고 일단 올라가면 풍경을 동시에 보려면 많은 사람들과 함께 바삐 움직여야 합니다. 케이블카를 타고 올라와도 정상의 입구에 도착하기 위해 몇 층의 계단을 올라야 하므로 계단을 탈 수 없는 경우에도 이것을 권장하지 않습니다.
1195,1195,60,2848,"Great view. Couples can buy a lock and express their love by writing some nice words on it, then lock it at the bridge. You can visit the tower but nothing special.

The only gripe is that you are being packed like sardines in the cable car and I didn't quite enjoy that. 2) By bus. Cheaper option as well. The bus is not crowded like the cable car. But the uphill hike of 5 mins is quite strenuous.  Overall it is a great place to visit if you haven't been up. But otherwise, nothing too special.",1196,nothing,N서울타워에 올라가는 방법은 크게 두 가지가 있습니다. 1) 케이블카 이용. 대기열은 길지만 꽤 빠르게 움직입니다. 유일한 불만은 당신이 케이블카에서 정어리처럼 포장되고 있다는 것입니다. 그리고 나는 그것을 즐기지 못했습니다. 2) 버스로. 더 저렴한 옵션도 있습니다. 버스는 케이블카처럼 붐비지 않습니다. 그러나 5분의 오르막길은 꽤 힘겹다. 전반적으로 올라가지 않았다면 방문하기 좋은 곳입니다. 그러나 그렇지 않으면 너무 특별한 것은 없습니다.
1197,1197,62,2926,We went there on a very clear night. The night lights of Seoul is average and the sight from the tower is nothing spectacular. The only interesting thing is the cable car which takes you to the tower. But expect long queues. You'd get bored on the tower after 30min.,1197,nothing,우리는 매우 맑은 밤에 거기에 갔다. 서울의 야간 조명은 평범하고 타워에서 보는 광경은 장관이 아닙니다. 유일하게 흥미로운 것은 타워까지 데려다주는 케이블카입니다. 그러나 긴 대기열을 예상하십시오. 당신은 30 분 후에 타워에서 지루할 것입니다.
1198,1198,63,3043,I think you need to get a perfect day from a weather side. We spent 3 days in Seoul and there was too much fog everyday. We finally went up. It was nice but nothing special compared to other observation building around the world. Hard to see much and not worth the price.,1198,nothing,날씨 면에서 완벽한 하루를 보내야 한다고 생각합니다. 우리는 서울에서 3일을 보냈고 매일 안개가 너무 많이 끼었습니다. 우리는 마침내 올라갔다. 좋았지만 전 세계의 다른 전망대에 비하면 특별할 것은 없었다. 많이보기 힘들고 가격 가치가 없습니다.
1199,1199,64,3077,"You can see the tower from the bottom. If you want a bird eye view of the city, you can pay to go up the tower's viewing deck. Other than that there's nothing much you could do",1199,nothing,아래에서 타워를 볼 수 있습니다. 도시의 조감도를 원하면 타워의 전망대에 올라가 비용을 지불할 수 있습니다. 그 외에는 할 수 있는 게 별로 없다.

So what is the point for letting guest to go up and cannot see any view expect fog?",1200,nothing,관광지로 유명한 곳이라 그런지 매표소에 손님 안내방송이 없다는 사실을 용납할 수 없었습니다. 습한 날씨에 매표소에 안내방송이 없다는 사실을 용납할 수 없었습니다. 타워의 거울은 온통 습기로 가려져 내부에서 아무것도 볼 수 없었습니다. ! 그렇다면 손님이 올라가서 안개가 예상되는 어떤 전망도 볼 수 없도록 하는 요점은 무엇입니까?
1201,1201,66,3147,"This is actually anothe one telco tower used in the past, renovated to serve as a tourist attraction.

The view was therefore nothing to write home about. Had I known it was a windowed deck I wouldn't have paid 10,000 KRW for it. Absolutely not worth it. Any observation deck that is not open air is in my opinion an obscene injustice to the actual view.  The view from the bottom of the tower is far better.",1202,nothing,안개가 자욱한 밤에 올라갔는데 어쩐지 야외 데크인 줄 알았다. 그렇지 않았다. 그리고 창문은 얼룩으로 인해 더러워졌습니다. 그러므로 보기는 집에 쓸 만한 것이 아니었습니다. 창가데크인줄 알았으면 1만원도 안줬을텐데.. 절대 가치가 없습니다. 야외가 아닌 모든 전망대는 내 생각에 실제보기에 대한 외설적 인 부당함입니다. 타워의 바닥에서 보는 전망이 훨씬 낫습니다.
1203,1203,68,3217,"We are residents in Seoul since 4 years and we went every year more as twice up to the tower. It was a nice green place within a busy town. I remember 3 years ago it was a relaxing walk up and down and also the tower area was quite peaceful. Somehow I have the feeling it is worsening year by year. The operator has started to renovate and offer now several floors with shops, restaurants and whatsoever. Some of them opened and just closed again. LOL. Why? Because probably not many people will spend a penny there. There are mainly interested in making selfies. That's it. And who shall buy all these things you really don't need? We went there and left every time at least 50k for tower entrance and a beer, coffee or ice cream. There were a few shops totally enough to serve visitors. And usually you climb up to have a nice few and not to drink and eat whole day long. Anyway this time is over for us spending any coin there. This year every time we visited the place it was totally over crowded. If you want to visit tower's upper floor you shall wait at least an hour or even more. Especially on the weekends. Same way down. I can be wrong but since 2015 it changed dramatically. We usually walking either up or down along the small road. I remember the time when we saw many people using the bike to go up. Time is over. Now every minute some old diesel engine is rushing uphill to unload and to come back to collect again. Some of them are driving fast and reckless. If you have kids you are mainly busy with watching them because you are afraid that something happened. I really wonder why Seoul citizens are not doing much about it. Did they gave up already? Do they like how it is? This place becomes really disgusting. It has nothing to do anymore with a nice, beautiful, quiet, green, park and place. It just became a polluted place of commerce. We will not visit again. We are done with this tower. Have fun.",1203,nothing,"우리는 4년 동안 서울에 거주하고 있으며 매년 두 번 이상 타워에 올랐습니다. 번화한 도시 안에 있는 멋진 녹지였습니다. 3년 전만 해도 위아래로 한가로운 산책이었고 타워 주변도 꽤 평화로웠던 걸로 기억합니다. 어쩐지 해가 갈수록 심해지는 느낌이 든다. 운영자는 개조를 시작했으며 현재 상점, 레스토랑 등이 있는 여러 층을 제공합니다. 그들 중 일부는 열렸다가 다시 닫혔습니다. ㅋㅋㅋ. 왜요? 아마 많은 사람들이 거기에 한 푼도 쓰지 않을 것이기 때문입니다. 주로 셀카를 만드는 데 관심이 있습니다. 그게 다야 그리고 당신이 정말로 필요로 하지 않는 이 모든 것을 누가 사겠습니까? 우리는 거기에 가서 타워 입구와 맥주, 커피 또는 아이스크림을 위해 매번 최소 50k를 떠났습니다. 손님을 응대하기에 충분한 상점이 몇 개있었습니다. 그리고 보통 당신은 술을 마시지 않고 하루 종일 먹지 않기 위해 올라갑니다. 어쨌든 이 시간은 우리가 거기에서 어떤 코인이라도 쓰는 것입니다. 올해 우리가 방문할 때마다 그곳은 완전히 붐볐습니다. 타워의 고층을 방문하려면 최소 1시간 이상을 기다려야 합니다. 특히 주말에. 같은 방법으로 아래로. 내가 틀릴 수 있지만 2015년 이후로 극적으로 바뀌었습니다. 우리는 보통 작은 길을 따라 오르거나 내려갑니다. 많은 사람들이 자전거를 타고 올라가는 것을 보았을 때를 기억합니다. 시간이 끝났습니다. 이제 매분 오래된 디젤 엔진이 내리막길을 오르막으로 돌진하고 있습니다. 그들 중 일부는 빠르고 무모하게 운전합니다. 자녀가 있는 경우에는 무슨 일이 일어날까 두려우므로 주로 자녀를 지켜보느라 바쁩니다. 왜 서울 시민들은 그것에 대해 별로 하지 않는지 정말 궁금합니다. 그들은 이미 포기 했습니까? 그들은 어떻게 그것을 좋아합니까? 이 곳은 정말 역겨워집니다. 그것은 더 이상 멋지고, 아름답고, 조용하고, 푸르고, 공원과 장소와 아무 관련이 없습니다. 오염된 상가가 되었습니다. 우리는 다시 방문하지 않을 것입니다. 우리는 이 타워를 끝냈습니다. 즐거운 시간 보내세요."

This is Seoul Tower which, obviously offers splendid of all sides of the city, and for this it is worth the queue and the detour. No discussion, especially because Seoul is a complex and diverse city with all its hills and its difficult too appreciate it globally otherwise. This being said, the tower itself is nothing special, even rather on the dated side in comparions with many others (for example the windows are straight (and dirty) which is not ideal to take pictures).

You can also purchase souvenirs for yourself. We carried out our own lunch so dont have much idea about the food services there. After having our lunch, we visited the alive museum which was right next to the Seoul tower.

But although the crowds were not that substantial it is nothing that special - until you compare it to any of the other attractions in Seoul!

I've been 3 or 4 times and the wait has ranged from 1.5 hours to nothing. So be prepared for a bit of a wait, but you will have a great view of the city.

On the other hand, the base of the tower gives good enough views at all 360 degrees and there's restaurants and cafes to spend time there too.

Seoul Tower from the minute of booking my trip to Seoul. I booked a nite trip with Koridoor (we stopped at other locations as well as the N.Seoul Tower). The elevator ride up was great. I LOVED the view from up there however trying to take photos were hard because of the glare off the glass so that ruined it for me because I couldn't get the great shots that I wanted to get. If taking pictures really isn't at the top of your list then YES, it is a must see other than that go in the day time and the glares from the indoor lights may not affect your pictures as much as the night time views.  Before going up on the tower there is some areas to sit around and some shops to purchase food/snacks such as Coldstone. They also have the love lock area.

So going up the hill where the tower is is one part of the journey, and costs two elevator tickets and after that you buy the ticket to get up the tower.

The exhibition, one of those live art deals where you can be a part of the art, was quite lame. I guess it was exactly as described but the atmosphere was empty and there's just not much excitement to have when you can really only do the pose they show you, nothing unique about your experience.  Then there's a SECOND hall, which looked totally devoid of people and I can see why. One is enough.  Going up to the observatory and you get the good views. I've been up enough buildings to know this is your bog standard deal. I actually found the 63 building view to be far superior, because you're closer to stuff for viewing, not up a mountain. the 63 building is in a place where you can see all the traffic and detail, and it's such an unpopular tourist attraction nowadays it takes no time and you get to see all round. So maybe check that out instead.  When I left, I expected the scheduled lights display on the Seoul Tower, which, when I was there a few years back came with music and 3d laser stuff and animations on the floor. This time, I got what seemed to be 3 minutes of silent advertisement on the tower, and nothing else. What an incredible disappointment. I was building up to that moment the whole time. I can only hope it was a one-off thing due to MERS.  Getting back down is hugely inconvenient since there are no taxis or buses, so you have to get this weird elevator down a side cliff, onto the road and walk 15 minutes or so to the subway.

To reach the tower you will have to walk around half KM from nearest bus stop and metro.  You can either walk all the way to the top, which can be bit taxing. Or take the option that I took, of taking cable car from mid way of the hill to the tower.  Do note that cable car entry may become crowded and will require you to wait for getting your turn.  Once in the tower complex you need to collect ticket for going to top of the tower in lift. View from is great, though you get a feeling that they have tried a bit to replicate Eiffel tower.

1268,1268,133,5355,We came here because it was such a landmark building in Seoul. There was nothing special about this place... It was just one if those towers for viewing the city. The view was not that impressive.,1268,nothing,서울의 랜드마크 건물이었기 때문에 여기까지 왔습니다. 이곳은 특별한 것이 없었습니다... 도시를 보기 위한 타워라면 딱 하나였습니다. 보기는 그다지 인상적이지 않았습니다.
1269,1269,134,5378,A trip to Seoul is not complete without going to the tower. The view is great (suggest you go at night) but there is nothing much to do once you're there.,1269,nothing,서울 여행은 타워에 가지 않고는 완료되지 않습니다. 전망은 훌륭하지만(밤에 갈 것을 제안) 일단 거기에 가면 할 일이 별로 없습니다.
1270,1270,135,5422,"It's nothing special, just a good view of Seoul. And you have paid money for entrance ticket just for view?",1270,nothing,특별할 것도 없고 그냥 서울 전경이 좋다. 그리고 관람을 위해 입장료를 지불했습니까?
1271,1271,136,5440,"I went here twice in a row for the past two years every time I visit Seoul. I came here during winter so it's really no big deal to walk that high to reach the N-tower. Yes, from the bus stop, we need to walk pretty high to reach the are. There's no ladder whatsoever, so we have to, well literally climb, the hill. I'm sure my friends whom I've brought here lose their breath every 100meters. Hahaha. Just make sure you know that there's a pretty sloppy road to reach the tower.  To reach N-tower you can use the gondola from Myeongdong, which is pretty expensive, or you can go by bus from nearest area downtown. I stopped at Konkuk uni, and wait for the bus number 2,3,or 5 to go to N-tower. Going by bus is really nice, since you can experience how crazy Korean bus drivers are. Their driving skill is really scary! If you go by bus, make sure you take a seat. I don't really recommend you standing on a Korean bus though.  I am not really into a gondola for a city view, so I better save that money for riding gondola at Seorak Mountain. Anyway, you have to go to N-tower in the evening. Around 4 pm maybe then you can arrive there around 5 or 6, and you can see an illuminated Seoul. It's really beautiful.  I can't say that there's nothing you can do here. I always spent like 3-4 hours here. My friends like to see what's written in the locks. There's a lot of steel trees with locks. People say you can write your wish on the lock and put the lock on the tree then your wish may come true. Well, at least mine. We love to take pictures here, it's really like photographers' site though.  There's also a restaurant at the top of the tower, and several other restaurants with nice views at the ground floor. We can enjoy the view while having dinner. Then there's several souvenir shops which are hard to miss on. They sell various nice stuffs with N-tower emboss. The price is not very expensive too. If you are lucky perhaps you can find something even more cheaper than the one in Namdaemun.  In N-tower, there's a teddy bear museum. I only went here once. Practically showing Korean history throughout centuries but using teddy bear as the diorama. Cute place, you can take pictures too inside. The price is pretty expensive, but if you are not planning to go to Jeju island, it's better you go to this place. Yes, there's also one teddy bear museum in Jeju island as one of Jeju's main attraction.  To go inside N-tower, you don't need an entrance fee. But to go to the top of the tower, and to go inside teddy bear museum, yes, you need an entrance fee. Any choice is up to you and I don't think money is really a matter for such experience.",1271,nothing,"나는 서울을 방문할 때마다 지난 2년 동안 이곳에 두 번 연속으로 갔다. 나는 겨울에 여기에 왔기 때문에 N 타워에 도달하기 위해 그렇게 높이 걷는 것은 실제로 큰 문제가 아닙니다. 예, 버스 정류장에서 우리는 꽤 높은 곳을 걸어야 합니다. 사다리가 전혀 없기 때문에 말 그대로 언덕을 올라야 합니다. 이곳에 데려온 친구들은 100미터마다 숨이 가빠질 것 같아요. 하하하. 타워에 도달하는 꽤 엉성한 길이 있다는 것을 알고 있는지 확인하십시오. 엔타워에 가려면 꽤 비싼 명동에서 곤돌라를 이용하거나 시내에서 가장 가까운 지역에서 버스로 갈 수 있습니다. 건국대에 들렀다가 N타워로 가는 2,3,5번 버스를 기다립니다. 한국 버스 기사들이 얼마나 미친 지 경험할 수 있기 때문에 버스를 타는 것은 정말 좋습니다. 그들의 운전 실력은 정말 무섭습니다! 버스를 타고 갈 경우에는 반드시 자리에 앉으십시오. 하지만 한국 버스에 서 있는 것은 별로 추천하지 않습니다. 나는 도시 전망을 위해 곤돌라를 좋아하지 않기 때문에 설악산에서 곤돌라를 타기 위해 그 돈을 모으는 것이 좋습니다. 어쨌든 저녁에는 N타워로 가야 한다. 오후 4시쯤이면 아마 5시나 6시쯤 도착할 수 있고, 조명이 켜진 서울을 볼 수 있습니다. 정말 아름답습니다. 여기서 할 수 있는 일이 없다고 말할 수는 없습니다. 나는 항상 여기에서 3-4 시간을 보냈습니다. 내 친구들은 자물쇠에 적힌 내용을 보고 싶어합니다. 자물쇠가 달린 강철 나무가 많이 있습니다. 자물쇠에 소원을 적고 나무에 자물쇠를 걸면 소원이 이루어진다고 합니다. 글쎄, 적어도 내. 우리는 여기에서 사진을 찍는 것을 좋아하지만 사진 작가의 사이트와 같습니다. 타워 꼭대기에는 레스토랑이 있고 1층에는 멋진 전망을 즐길 수 있는 여러 레스토랑이 있습니다. 저녁을 먹으면서 경치를 감상할 수 있습니다. 그 다음에는 놓칠 수 없는 여러 기념품 가게가 있습니다. N 타워 엠보싱으로 다양한 멋진 물건을 판매합니다. 가격도 그리 비싸지 않습니다. 운이 좋다면 남대문보다 더 저렴한 것을 찾을 수도 있습니다. N-타워에는 테디베어 박물관이 있습니다. 나는 한 번만 여기에 갔다. 수세기에 걸친 한국의 역사를 실제로 보여 주지만 테디 베어를 디오라마로 사용합니다. 아기자기한 곳, 내부에서도 사진을 찍을 수 있습니다. 가격은 꽤 비싸지만 제주도에 갈 계획이 없다면 이곳을 가는 것이 좋다. 네, 제주의 주요 명소 중 하나로 제주도에도 테디베어 박물관이 하나 있습니다. N-tower에 들어가려면 입장료가 필요하지 않습니다. 하지만 탑 꼭대기에 올라가 테디베어 박물관에 들어가려면 네, 입장료가 필요합니다. 모든 선택은 당신에게 달려 있으며 나는 그러한 경험에 돈이 정말로 문제가 아니라고 생각합니다."
1272,1272,137,5441,"This tower is best for couples. You can bring or buy love lock there and put it to the fence as a symbol of ""securing your love"". The scenery from there is beautiful, but the tower is not really high and nothing really special about it.",1272,nothing,"이 타워는 커플에게 가장 좋습니다. 거기에서 사랑의 자물쇠를 가져 오거나 구입할 수 있으며 ""사랑 확보""의 상징으로 울타리에 넣을 수 있습니다. 그곳에서 바라보는 풍경은 아름답지만, 타워는 그다지 높지도 않고 그다지 특별할 것도 없습니다."
