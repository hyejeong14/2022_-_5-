0,0,151,"This is the largest palace complex in Seoul. Its history is very interesting! The palace is in reality a reconstruction; the original palace was burned and demolished by the Japanese during their occupation of Korea last century. The restoration of the palace is quite good. Unfortunately, most rooms are empty as their contents disappeared. Only the library in the back of the palace is original and its content is well-preserved. It still works as a public library. The floors, colors, roofs, and windows are original.  Some tips:  1. If you plan to stay in Seoul for at least four or five days and want to learn on the rich past of Korea, you should start you visit here.  2. You may spent the whole day visiting the palace grounds. It is quite relaxing, very well-kept, large, magical. There is a traditional, small tea shop within the palace where you can refresh drinking a delicious Korean tea in a Korean atmosphere.  3. Bathrooms are located in different places. They are impeccable.  4. Buy the ticket that covers all palaces. It is cheap. It last for several days. It will give you access to three other palaces (Two are close by), the secret garden (beautiful place), and the Jongmyo sanctuary. All are UNESCO sites. The sanctuary is far away and you need to take the metro. The palaces and the gardens are walking distance. This is why you need at least 2, (ideally 3 days) to visit all these sites.  5. If your interest is in in the rich past of Seoul ( Joseon period), the ticket is perfect. Look for a hotel in this area. Seoul is very big and crowded. Traffic is hectic and distances are enormous.  6. If you rent a Hanbok (Traditional Korean clothing) you will have free access to the palace. This is nice as it will make you feel more local and the pictures could be lovely. However, keep in mind that clothing is heavy and hot. We were there in September of 2019. It was a warm and humid day. It was not too hot. However, people wearing Hanboks shortened their visit because of how hot and wet they felt.  7. See the change of guards. We saw it at noon. It is a colorful symbolic, short ceremony. No many tourists; people behaved really well.  8. After finishing your visit, go to Insa Dong for dinner and shopping. It is really nice and relaxing. It takes 10-15 minutes to get to Insa Dong (walking distance). You may have ice cream midway.",0,empty

4,4,672,The palace is very pretty. Not spectacular at all but very pretty and a nice place to kill some time. Went there today with my mother. It is packed and just empty shells of buildings.

5,5,674,"This is a strange place. First of all it had been completely destroyed by the Japanese (and many times before) and they only started reconstructing it in the 1990s - so the entire thing is only about 20 years old (and they are still adding buildings) and completely empty. Secondly it looks like a small Korean copy of the forbidden city in Beijing. With this in mind it is still an interesting visit as it gives an idea how the original palace might have looked like, if you have only time for one place I would recommend Changdeokgung, which is more authentic and imho more beautiful.",5,empty

This palace is very large, but never empty of visitors since it's the main palace. Oh good thing is this object provide free locker where we can put our bag. It's located near from the entrance.  Many people come here using hanbok (traditional clothes from Korea). Surely can take beautiful photos here.",7,empty

On highlight is the changing of the place guard ceremony twice a day except Mondays, If you are over 65 take a copy of your passport or other proof of age as its free entry.

Some reviewers complain there isn't much to see here. But I guess it depends upon what your goals are.Yes, the buildings are mostly closed or empty. But the way the palace is built with exposure to weather with unheated buildings, it is understandable why they won't be full of ancient artifacts. You'll find those in museums nearby. I have been here probably five times going back over 30 years, and I never cease to find it a place to calmly reflect on Korea's ancient and interesting history as a keystone located in the heart of East Asia. Additionally, you will find two great museums within its boundary. A great place for leisurely walks and quiet thinking (except on Korean holidays!).",9,empty
10,10,1067,I visited this palace today.  Wow - how boring can a palace be! This one takes the biscuit!! Lots of Koreans all garbed up in traditional Korean dress which they hire locally - even men so they get free admission. Selfies are the order of the day. We maybe just a bit of glamour.  Let's get down to hard facts. Lots of buildings - most closed with nothing to see. Those open / nothing inside - again empty rooms - nothing to see. Exceptions: the throne room has a throne in - basic and the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion is of national significance for its important part in architectural design and application.  This is not a place to visit even if it only costs 4000 won.  The National Palace Museum of Korea is in the same compound (admission free) is excellent. So head there when disillusionment overcomes you from your Palace experience.,10,empty

Visitors are not allowed to enter any of the buildings which are empty, however are free to walk everywhere. Everything is outdoor... The weather was pretty cold when we were there. The cafe and gift shop was our temporary hideout for snacks and hot tea. There are free English tours available at certain times during the day. We did not join the tour due to the cold weather. The guards change ceremony is also interesting to watch. This was one of the busiest palace we visited during our trip. We spent about 2-3 hours here.",11,empty

16,16,1573,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is absolutely huge, but after a while all of the buildings start to look very similar. The first part of the palace is the most interesting: Gwanghwamun Gate, the large paved courtyards and the throne room are truly impressive. After the first 3 or 4 buildings I got bored very quickly and found that the rest of the palace consisted of nothing more than empty rooms in near identical buildings. The only features of interest past the initial cluster of buildings were the small lake with the garden island (behind the main palace) and the large pavilion for official entertaining on a large lake to the west of the main section of palace buildings. A lack of clear signage made it hard to find where to go next. I spent an hour and a half wandering around until I lost interest but you could easily spend much more time here if you wanted to. I was a bit disappointed that the palace is largely just empty buildings you can only see from the outside - it is hard to appreciate the rich history of Korea when one buildings looks the same as the one you just saw. Changdeokgung Palace had more character and was much prettier. The Changing of the Guard happens regularly and is a good show, but not as interesting as the one at Deoksugung Palace.",16,empty

Nevertheless, an eye opener for first timers.  I went there during December, as the place is covered with mud and melted snow, it gets quite dirty for your shoes as well as for your legs (jeans).

Inside it's beautiful with many places to walk around and enjoy a nice day in the park.

62,4,1573,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is absolutely huge, but after a while all of the buildings start to look very similar. The first part of the palace is the most interesting: Gwanghwamun Gate, the large paved courtyards and the throne room are truly impressive. After the first 3 or 4 buildings I got bored very quickly and found that the rest of the palace consisted of nothing more than empty rooms in near identical buildings. The only features of interest past the initial cluster of buildings were the small lake with the garden island (behind the main palace) and the large pavilion for official entertaining on a large lake to the west of the main section of palace buildings. A lack of clear signage made it hard to find where to go next. I spent an hour and a half wandering around until I lost interest but you could easily spend much more time here if you wanted to. I was a bit disappointed that the palace is largely just empty buildings you can only see from the outside - it is hard to appreciate the rich history of Korea when one buildings looks the same as the one you just saw. Changdeokgung Palace had more character and was much prettier. The Changing of the Guard happens regularly and is a good show, but not as interesting as the one at Deoksugung Palace.",62,disappointed
63,5,1652,"If you read my other reviews on the palaces in Korea, then you will know that it is a good first step if you have never visited other Asian palaces in Japan or China. If you have, you may feel disappointed because Korean palaces lacks the grandeur of their Asian neighbours. I never got the ""awe"" factor.",63,disappointed
64,6,1757,My family and I were only able to go around half of the whole place but everything was so picturesque! Made me feel like I was part of the numerous history dramas Koreans would do. Haha!  I suggest you check the schedules of their tours or make sure to get a map or just try your best not to get lost because it's a really big place. A bit disappointed because we weren't able to cover the whole thing but it was nice! They have a small museum inside so you better check that out as well!,64,disappointed
65,7,1762,I was excited to see the Gyeongbokgung Palace but ended up getting disappointed. The place was nice and vast however there is nothing much to see inside. There's a lot of buildings that look the same.,65,disappointed

67,9,1790,"I was pleasantly surprised with the Gyeongbokgung palace complex. True, I had read that this was a place not to be missed, and so I was expecting something rather grand. What I did not expect was how expansive the grounds of this palace really are, especially the gardens and peripheral structures to the rear (north). In fact, the gardens and ornamental lakes were where I spent most of my time, and I thoroughly recommend that you get away from the main palace buildings and to lose yourself in this green and peaceful gardenscape if you can.  A few practicalities: I visited the palace on a Saturday afternoon, and to be honest the crowds weren't nearly as bad as I had expected (try doing the same thing at Beijing's Forbidden Palace, for instance). Still, a week day or early morning would definitely better for more solitude. The entrance fee of about US$3 is a real bargain, and you can get tickets valid for one month for about US$10 if you are staying in Seoul for a longer time. Try to arrive at the palace on foot and walk north on Gwanghwamun Plaza to get a really good idea of the grandeur of this magnificent palace, with the sharp granite mountains in the background.  If you only get to see one thing in Seoul, make sure it's the Gyeongbokgung palace. You won't be disappointed!",67,disappointed
68,10,1853,"The sheer enormity of Gyeongbokgung Palace can be a bit daunting, but I do encourage anyone visiting Seoul to take a few hours to wander through the grounds of this amazing palace.  After passing through Gwanghwamun Gate (the main gate of the palace, which is itself enormous and visually stunning, especially as it is lit up at night), there are many structures to walk through within the temple's vast walls, along with amazing courtyards, pavilions, statues and traditional Korean gardens. Each gate and doorway passed through provides new and wonderful sights to take in. The temple's vibrant color scheme of teal, red, purple and orange -- seemingly standard throughout most if not all of Korea's temples and palaces -- is a delight to behold.  The National Folk Museum of Korea, as well as the National Palace Museum of Korea, are also located within its walls, and tours are available for both.  The palace is very easy to get to, with close access to the subway and bus routes, and seems surprising and almost out of place in the middle of such a busy city. But once inside its impressive walls, one can quickly forget that you're in a bustling, modern city and allow yourself to be transported to a different and distant time.  Although it attracts a lot of tourists, I highly recommend spending a few hours visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace -- you won't be disappointed. And if you can visit on a weekday the crowds will be far fewer.",68,disappointed
69,11,1947,"I'd like to start off by saying that I'm a history buff - especially the dynasties of East Asian countries. Having read so much good reviews, I made this palace my top priority during my visit. To say that I was disappointed would have been an understatement. It was like a palace on a budget. Don't go expecting the splendor of a bygone era. The sprawling grounds are filled with identical buildings with little to differentiate from one to another. Even my poor hard-working tour guide was hard put to infuse much enthusiasm into the group which had gone there with so much anticipation.",69,disappointed
70,12,2132,"The entrance, main palace and the palace museum are a must see (KW3000 entrance fee). The changing of the guards is an added bonus if you happen to be on time for the event. Note that the palace is expansive which require a lot of walking on stone path and gravel. There are not much shaded tress and places to rest expect around buildings. So an early morning visit is recommended. I made a reservation for an English guided tour of the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion only be disappointed as the tour guide decided to conduct it in the local vernacular. I did inquire though as she stated that she can give me a 10 minute English guide after she is done with the group but left before she finished.",70,disappointed

We paid to go in as we were not wearing their transitional costumes, it was good that the fee was not expensive.",71,disappointed

A few doors open to look at empty spaces with painted walls but most areas doors locked and cannot see inside. No furniture, no mats. Do not get a feel for how they lived many years ago. There is construction going on in some area which were completely blocked off. I was disappointed because I wanted a sense of how the family lived their lives during that time period. Only saw buildings.",73,disappointed

Go early as not to miss changing of guard and visit to Gardens.   .",75,disappointed
76,18,2719,"Palace is beautiful but disappointed that it didn’t have clear directions.  I wish the buildings were labeled with a numbering system (and a starting point) and a more detailed explanation of each structure. Info pamphlet, 500 won, was in very small font and difficult to read.  Also, it would be nice if the cleaning staff can clean and quietly during non-tour hours. They were yelling at each other inside the structures with the tourists looking on.  We were at the Nijo Castle in Kyoto just couple of days prior to this visit. Plenty of explanations and quiet working staff in uniform.  Also, it was disappointing to see sub-par restorations (for some parts) to a national treasure.",76,disappointed
77,19,2747,I went on a Saturday morning around 11 am so I could see the change of the guard act. It is ok but nothing that you will feel disappointed if you miss it. The palace is huge and interesting. Some of the pavilions were closed for repairing. There were a lot of tourists and some of them hired Korean traditional customs. Be ready to have lots of girls dressed up in Korean traditional dresses spending ages in different parts of the palace taking pictures. They are an absolute nightmare. They take and retake pictures and selfies for hours. I felt that there should be some information about the different buildings and their function.,77,disappointed
78,20,2765,"I walked the whole palace. I was giving high hope to review the history and how the emperor or ancient Korean lived. However, it seems like no one comment this is a REBUILD of everything!!!! You can still be amazing by the size and the building structure. However, beside the main palace all other places are empty..... A bit disappointed because I like to understand the Korean culture more. Still you can see the Korean government's effort to rebuild the palace and allow tourists understand their past.",78,disappointed
79,21,3017,"Usually I'm the architecture junkie that make sure every trip is filled with historical sites and buildings, but Gyeongbokgung to be honest, didn't lived up to my expectations. The palace is rather big and empty( in terms of decor / plants etc) I'm not sure if its because I went in Autumn, and the plants died off + there was an event setup going on in the middle of the palace (kinda ruins the vibe). Some of the buildings are closed of for repairs extension for winter(?), which made my visit kinda disappointed. But the palace was rather big and the museum at the side was worth the visit.",79,disappointed
80,22,3542,We went with family and explored this amazing palace and were not disappointed. Spring is the best time--mid-April when the flowers are blooming. Be sure to visit the museums--I preferred the National Folk museum as it showed a lot more of the Korean culture. There are free guided tours in several languages during the day that start near the information center that last about 1 hour but we found just reading the brochure and taking our time the best way to go.,80,disappointed

It is still worthwhile to visit, but do not expect too much. I like the museum next to the palace though and would recommend to visit that one too when you already there.",82,disappointed

I went another time in fall with my sister. We got there in time for the changing of the guard ceremony which is worth scheduling around if you can. My third visit was on a special evening opening. I had to book a ticket online. I went, like most others, with a tripod and my DSLR to try and get some sweet pictures. There was a full moon that night, so we weren't disappointed.",84,disappointed

86,28,4089,"it was a really nice palace, but not as splendid as i expected for the royal palace. Especially after visiting the other palaces, i need to say that it's not really that different. IT's worth going to the palace, but there is no need visiting more than one. I was done with my tour after 1 hour. I was a little bit disappointed that you could hardly see inside the building. It's very easy to get there by bus and you should also visit the Bukcheon Village close-by. By the way renting a Hanbok (in some shops nearby) costs 10.000 (i think for 1 hour), but in summer it can get really hot wearing that.",86,disappointed
87,29,4602,"We spent a day exploring the palace grounds are were not disappointed. The weather was great and really allowed us to maximize our time there. We started out the day by watching the changing of the guard at Gwanghwamun gate (it's worth watching and occurs every few hours around, I think we saw it at 11 am). We did not partake in a guided tour (not sure if they're available) but we did purchase some audio guides which did an adequate job of guiding us around the grounds. In addition to the gate at Gwanghwamun, there are several other gates leading into the main grounds where you can find the main palaces. The entire place is colorful and features an architectural style unique to Korea. Visiting at this time of year is especially good because the cherry blossoms are all blooming, making the palace's numerous gardens very beautiful. There are also royal residences, guest houses, temples and the king's library/study. You can spend many hours in the palace grounds and I would suggest you visit earlier rather than later, as crowds accumulate quickly and the palace closes around 6pm. In all, visiting Gyeongbokgung palace was by far my favorite experience while visiting Seoul and I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city and looking for something to do at a relatively low cost (bar minimum was transportation costs plus admission tickets and paying for the audio tour if you want it).",87,disappointed
88,30,4695,"Although not the prettiest royal palace in Seoul, it is a must-see because of the size and many other attractions within the palace. If you can do the evening tour, you are in for a very different experience which is also recommended.

Noone is allowed to see what it is inside. So for me, it is a turn off.  This trip is more of like a trip to see building, lakes, and park, and nothing about the palace.",90,disappointed
91,33,4936,"The palace grounds was very huge but every check point is about the same.the king's chambers, the queen mother's chambers then the concubines' chambers. They all look the same. I was a bit disappointed to find out that almost the entire place is rebuilt, it's not the original palace but it was burnt down during the Japanese invasion. and they're not done adding on new segments of the palace. entrance fee is pretty cheap. the architecture seems pretty normal. probably the more interesting thing to do here is to try on the palace guard uniform for free and witness the guard changing ceremony. give this a miss if you are not into touristy stuff.",91,disappointed
92,34,4941,"While I was looking forward to this trip, I did not have any expectations whatsoever so as not to ruin the mood. This is the second palace I visited, and it lies just in front of two statues, one of the admiral and the other King Sejong, seated in a chair, and founder of the Korean alphabet. The ticket entrance was 5000 won, a bit hefty if you ask me. The tour started and I joined a tour with an English translator, kudos to the translator for really trying to explain the history and details of all the buildings.  The architecture and style can somewhat be likened to those found in Shanghai and Beijing, maybe because of cultural influences. I was a bit disappointed though because of the lack of English descriptions of each of the place. Signages are also scant in the area and be ready to endure long walks!  I suggest going here in the morning or early lunch time so that you can have time to visit the blue house which the guide said was one gate away only from inside this palace. Unfortunately, I didn't see the blue house.  In total, I find this palace, nothing special, an average if you ask me, but I commend the departments involved here for really making sure to preserve the edifices. So, in going to Seoul, choose wisely which among the palaces you'll be visiting. This one would not be in my list again.",92,disappointed

I was looking forward to the changing of guards ceremony but was cancelled due to the frosty grounds (it snowed two nights ago). I was a bit disappointed but managed to see the palace complex. I was very careful not to tread on the slippery grounds (partly also I had sneakers that don't grip well with ice). I suggest not going to the palaces at winter time as activities are cancelled. Facing the palace was the modern Seoul. It was a perfect mix of the ancient and the modern Korea which has shaped the country. I ventured the palace by myself and they offer free tour guides on fixed times (usually in the afternoon). The information center which is on the gate going to the main palace was very helpful and I was thankful that.

Also noteworthy is the grand entrance from GwangWhaMun Avenue (with the statues of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin and King Sejong the great), as well as the changing of the guard at the front gate of the palace. The palace itself is very nice, large and extremely well maintained, with a nice natural area (with gardens, lakes) on the North Side. I'm ""only"" giving it 4 stars because as the ""national touristic attraction of Korea"" the palace itself doesn't rival in size with similar world renown landmarks in other cities (Forbidden City, Versailles...) and people with very high expectations could get disappointed a bit.",96,disappointed

What i am surprised was that the moment we exited the Metro station, we were met with a strong 'sand storm'! And this had continued throughout the next one hour or so when we toured the Palace!  We were surprised as well as disappointed that the Korean Government did not invest in well paved roads inside their supposed grandest Korean Palace ! Instead, sands were seen everywhere, in between buildings and practically - everywhere!  I would strongly suggest ladies to tie up your hair or at least wear a cap as well as put on your sunglasses!

The nearest subway is the Gyeongbokgung Station at exit 5. We didn't use the subway. We were at Insadong, and we walked for about 10 minutes from Ssamji-gil and arrived at the Gwanghwamun Gate around 2:50 pm.  At the time of our arrival, there is no ""Changing of the Guards Ceremony"". We were not disappointed because the tall Imperial Guards standing at the arched gateway in their costumes make awesome photos. Admission tickets at 3,000won each are purchased inside the grounds and you can photograph these guards or watch the changing ceremonies at the Gwanghwamun Gate for free without purchasing admission tickets.  Free guided tour starts at the reception office inside Heungnyemun Gate. English tours are at 11.00am, 1.30pm and 3.30pm. Groups of 10 to 30 people require reservation. It is advisable to use a guide otherwise you'll be walking around and snapping pictures without a clue of what you are looking or photographing at.  The Gyeongbokgung Palace has some Chinese architectural influence and it reminded us of the Forbidden City in Beijing. There are some cherry blossoms here and it was said that the Japanese, during their occupation, had planted some of the trees on sacred and offensive locations within the palace ground. After the occupation, these offending trees were destroyed. But today, the remaining cherry blossoms add a softer touch to the Palace and provide a lovely landscape.  Gyeongbokgung Palace is a huge complex consisting of many areas, pavilions, ponds, halls, chambers and gates and will need about 2 to 3 hours of your time. The hexagonal Hyangwonjeong Pavilion looks impressive and it was a pity they barricaded the bridge to prevent entry. It could only be admired from across the pond. Hyangwonjeong Pavilion will look best during autumn.  Lockers are available and smoking is not allowed anywhere in the palace area, except at designated sites.

Obviously, as my first date, it has a special place in my heart, but it still has plenty to check out. It's also very convenient and close to many other attractions or places to go (Statue of Lee, biggest foreign language bookstore, Tomatillos). Over all, the palaces are very similar, except one has ""Biwon"" which is the secret garden (not Gyeongbokgung, though) If you have been to the Forbidden Palace in Beijing, you may be disappointed. It is very similar, but smaller, but has it's own beauty, nevertheless. By comparison, the process of getting in here is much easier.

121,16,262,"When we arrived at the gates of the palace we were ushered inside the palace walls for a ceremony. Such good timing especially as the ceremony took less than ten minutes. Every 4th Wednesday is a special day and it is free to go in. There were lots of people in National dress looking very fine all glittering hooped skirts for the ladies and over large tall hats for the men. If you wear National Dress on any day it is also free to go in. The ground was very uneven and may be tricky for elderly to walk on. The grounds are massive, there was so much to see. It was originally built in 1395 and served as the home of Kings of the Joseon dynasty, and been extensively restored after various conflicts all but destroyed it. Well worth a visit. Take plenty of water and good walking shoes.",121,much
122,17,267,"I was not much interested about this place before going to this palace.Once we reached there,I rented an Hanbok for ₩9000/2hrs and hair braid ₩5000.Then that's it,you are ready to capture shots. It was raining heavily when we were there but still it was good.You could hire a guide there so that you will understand the history and culture of that palace.You will find museum which is free entry in the same compound.You can spend around 2hrs in that museum.Overall it was good.",122,much

124,19,282,"This is a good place to visit if you love to watch period Korean dramas and if you love historical buildings. There are many areas you can explore in Gyeong-bok-gung. (Gung means palace in Korean.)  The palace is very big so if you want to cover exploring the whole palace, give yourself the whole noon till evening, to visit this place.  There are some description of each building and areas to read but not a lot to read. If you want to learn more about each area and building, it would be good to have a guided tour in your own language. The little description placed there are not very detailed and do not explain much about the whole place.  I went this palace about three times on three different tours and each time was different. With a tour guide, you would learn why the floor is sand and stone (so that the guards could hear if someone is around to prevent assassination.). Without a guide, the floor would seem like it is just bare from tourists stepping all over.  You could enter the Palace for free if you are wearing a Korean traditional costume!  You could rent a traditional Korean costume from nearby shops just outside the palace. Try to rent them online in advance and go there early to collect them. The rental packages usually comes in 2 hours, 4 hours, 6hours or one day rental. And they are considered very cheap and affordable to rent! I had a 4 hour rental with additional 2 free hour package for only 24 SGD.  And because the shop was very near, I changed into the costume and entered the Palace in just a 5 minutes walk. And after visiting the palace and taking photos in the costume, we went back to the shop to return it and changed back. The whole process was very convenient.",124,much
125,20,298,"This is probably the most popular attraction in Seoul for both tourists and locals. It was very busy and everywhere there were people wearing national dress (hired from shops in the area). We timed our arrival for the changing of the guard which happens twice per day, it was colourful but not too serious. The palace covers a vast area and comprises a complex set of impressive buildings which are loosely interconnected. Most of the rooftops are highly decorated following the style of most historic buildings in Seoul but they have obviously been restored recently. The price of entry was very cheap although the secret garden is an additional cost (we didn't have time to go there). Just next door is another royal palace, Changgyeonggung, which was much quieter and is on a smaller scale but has lovely gardens.",125,much
126,21,303,Arrived here just in time for the changing of the guard and were glad we caught it as the spectacle of the different costumes is not to be missed. If you plan to see the other palaces too get the Royal Palace pass - it doesn't save you much money but it does mean you don't have to queue up for tickets again so saves a lot of time. Lots of beautiful buildings to wander around.,126,much
127,22,307,I only had a day for sight-seeing and this was an excellent site for a sunny day. I took advantage of a free walking tour which I would highly recommend and there is not much in terms of explanations at the various buildings. Allow for 2 hours to walk around if you have a tour.,127,much
128,23,334,"While this palace complex is similar in layout to the Forbidden City in Beijing, it is much smaller and less grand. If you visit on the hour you can see the changing of the guard ceremony. The costumes reflect the period when this was the Korean capital. This ceremony was worth the visit alone.",128,much
129,24,342,"I would say this is the largest and most grand palace in Seoul. The grounds are enormous with much to see. We went in the morning to see the changing of the guards, which my kids found fascinating. They even had a roped off section for children to sit so they could see better. If you could only see one palace this is the one.",129,much
130,25,378,"If you would like just to have a look at the neighbourhood, the grand palace and people strolling with their traditional hanbok, you can just stay outside and take wonderful pictures without having to soend your money getting inside as there were not so much to see.",130,much
131,26,401,Gyeongbokgung Palace itself was easy to find! (Stop at gyeongbokgung station). Rent a hanbok and you are able to enter for free !! I must say the palace is big and beautiful😍 As for me i really want to visit the palace as i always seen it on tv so seeing it in real life is amazing! Its big that you need 2 hours to explore the whole area and there’s alot of pretty spots where you can take photos with your hanbok!! Definitely recommend to visit with your hanbok because you’ll feel like you are a princess/prince!! But of course there will be alot of tourist so come early so there not much people!,131,much
132,27,408,"If you are just looking to do what everyone ‘should do’ coming to Seoul, go there, rent a ‘traditional’ costume and take lots of selfies for your instagram posts. Otherwise stay away. Most of what you will see is less then 20 years old and there are so many dressed up tourists, it feels like carnival. There are much better places to get an impression of historical palaces. On the other hand, the two musea on site are worth it. One is focused on daily lives of Korean people through time and the other one boast a solid collection of the interiors of the palaces.",132,much
133,28,458,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a lovely place to visit and take photos, especially if you rent Hanbok (traditional Korean outfits). It doesn't cost much to visit, maybe 3000 won, but if you rent Hanbok you can get in for free and take awesome photos.",133,much
134,29,460,A really great day out with English speaking tours! There was so much to see and learn about and we were lucky enough to visit whilst a guard ceremony was taking place.,134,much

136,31,490,This huge palace is a must see while in Seoul. Its got so much to see and is right in the middle of the city. Lots of people were dressed up in traditional korean attire. Great place for pictures and scenery or just for a nice long walk.,136,much
137,32,496,"This palace is huge. The buildings are lovely. Not much to see inside them. Very cool though. Plan several hours if you want to see everything. The changing of the guards is something I only saw at this palace and was nice to see. Crowded toward the front, but far fewer people toward the back. Good view of the ""blue palace"" from the back gate. Gwanghwamun on the purple line is the subway stop I used.",137,much
138,33,515,"I don't know where to start on reviewing this astonishingly beautiful palace except to say it us utterly beguiling and unmissable. It's so big and there is so much to see, different parts deserve their own listings to be honest! The highlight for me was the Gyeongheru Pavilion, just beautiful as its surrounded by a gorgeous lake. Its lovely to sit there and relax. Close second, and most people's favourite I'd say, is the majestic Geunjeongjon Hall which is the throne hall. The intricacy and colours are just mesmeric The King and Queens living quarters are lovely too and there is just so many lovely colourful and intricately decorated buildings around, not to mention scenic grounds. The row of chimneys in the Amisan Gardens to the rear of the queens consorts residence are interesting as they were vents for the underfloor heating! Anyway, give several hours, most of a day over to explore this magnificent palace complex. 5 stars just doesn't seem enough to give.",138,much
139,34,516,As I was travelling for business I did not have much time to sight see. My colleague took me to the palace to breathe in some Korean heritage. It was a lovely experience and I learned a lot about Korean history in a short (1 hour) time. Glad I didn't miss out!,139,much
140,35,517,"We went on a Thursday morning in May and it was not too crowded. This is the largest of the Seoul palaces and there is much to see in this restored palace compound. The changing of the guard ceremony is in the area where the tickets are sold and happens at 10:00 and 2:00. It is quite colorful and is more than just a changing of the guard. Inside the grounds is the National Folk Museum and it is included with the palace admission. It also is a large space and we only got half way through. One could really spend a lot of time in this palace area. For us, a half day was enough but it was quite nice.",140,much
141,36,542,"If you want to see a Korean templethings, this would be Your place to visit. At the time of our visit, there was things under maintenance, but it did not bother too much.",141,much

143,38,568,"This was the first, largest and the main royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. It was destroyed during the Japanese occupation and has taken much time and effort to be rebuilt and restored. The Changing of the Guard happened while I was there at about 9:30am. Free admission to even foreigner seniors. Many of the girls and some boys even wore the hanbok costumes for Instagram photos. From here one can go to the Folk Museum and then on to Bukchon Hanbok Village and then the Chandeokgong Palace which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Expect to spend many hours exploring this whole area as it is well worth it. Moving on from there take in lunch on Insadong Street and browse the shops. This will be such a day well spent in Seoul.",143,much
144,39,599,"The entrance, main palace and the palace museum are a must see (KW3000 entrance fee). The changing of the guards is an added bonus if you happen to be on time for the event. Note that the palace is expansive which require a lot of walking on stone path and gravel. There are not much shaded tress and places to rest expect around buildings. So an early morning visit is recommended. I made a reservation for an English guided tour of the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion only be disappointed as the tour guide decided to conduct it in the local vernacular. I did inquire though as she stated that she can give me a 10 minute English guide after she is done with the group but left before she finished.",144,much
145,40,627,Good for travellers who would like to learn much about the Korean traditional matters. The free guides were polite and helpful.,145,much
146,41,640,"We (me and my husband) came here around 11am on a Monday, so we avoided too much crowd. There were still enough people to keep it exciting, kids too! The ticket is 3000 won per person, which is great value. We did not purchase any audio guide or English guide book, we felt like exploring it ourselves. It was actually quite fun this way, lots to explore and it was a very different palace architecture with lot of open bits inside the palace too. I liked the roofs and doors design. We spent about 3 hours there and we just took a stroll and wandered - not sure if we saw the whole thing. The weather was beautiful and very sunny, although my husband who is white got sun burnt as we were out in the open for most of the time :-) so make sure you apply plenty of sun screen if you don't want to be burnt.  There are boards with information in English too, which helps. Attached photos!",146,much
147,42,643,"I've traveled all over Europe and visited my share of castles, but the grand scale of the grounds and buildings included in Gyeonbokgung cast a shadow on everything I've witnessed before. It is massive and a bit daunting. Make sure to wear comfortable walking shoes and grab a guidebook (offered in several languages) or hook up with a tour guide.  The main (most famous) gates of Gyeonbokgung are right off of Gwanghwamun Square, not far from the notable statue of King Sejong (which is another must-see when in Seoul). It's very easy to get here by subway, bus, or taxi; although, I suggest taking the subway - it's super inexpensive, and is possibly the BEST subway system I've ever experienced, EVER. (Very safe. Very clean. Very easy to navigate, even if you don't speak Korean or read Hangual.)  We exited the subway (sorry, can't remember which line or number), and it spit us out right by a museum/gift shop that had a side entrance to the palace. It worked out perfectly! We walked in the gates and were in the main, large open courtyard inside the main gates (that are on street level in Gwanghwamun Square).  The palace is always teeming with tourists from all over the world. It's bustling and dizzying and amazing all at once. Unlike European castles, there isn't just one, central building; but instead, multitudes of buildings with similar architecture scattered throughout the grounds. Some are open to be viewed (like the private rooms of the royal family members or the throne and state rooms) while others are boarded up and can only be viewed from the outside. There are beautiful flowers and water areas in different parts of the complex.  My favorite part was Hyangwonjeong Pavilion - an ""island"" in the northern grounds of the palace connected by a wooden bridge to the rest of the grounds. You're not allowed to enter the island, but it's magical to look at.  If you want to be extra thorough and make it to the back of the complex (where the servants and guards quarters are), you should probably allow yourself 3 hours or so to meander around. This is not the type of attraction where you are in and out in an hour! There is so much to see, you could easily spend most of a day here or split the grounds up and visit on two different days.  Although built in 1395, the palace was been rebuilt in the late 1800's due to fire (the buildings are nearly all made of wood); but the Koreans took great care to reconstruct the palace as it originally stood.  It's open most days from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. but is closed on Mondays or Tuesdays (can't remember which, but it was closed the first time we tried to visit) and holidays (check the website (http://www.royalpalace.go.kr/html/eng/main/main.jsp) to make sure it will be open when you intend to visit.  An absolute MUST-SEE. You will not regret visiting, and I suggest taking a walk through the nearby gift shop I mentioned. I'm sure the items are more expensive than elsewhere, but I never saw things they had for sale anywhere else but there. Worth it if you're looking for a unique memento of your visit to Seoul/Korea.",147,much
148,43,646,"Gyeongbokgung was within walking distance of my BnB and a great place to walk around. You can complete a decent circuit on your own in about 30-45 minutes. Try to time things so that you can be at the Gwanghwamun gate on the hour between 10am and 4pm. The 10am, 1pm and 3pm times are the extended show while the other hours only show a shortened version. Since the whole reenactment is only about 15 mins long, I'm not sure there is much at all to see with a shortened version! You don't need an extra ticket to see the changing of the guard, you just need to be in the right place at the right time.",148,much
149,44,653,"We were there at around 11 in the morning in late autumn. Weather was good but the wind was quite strong.  We walked from the Bukchon Hanok Village, where we stayed for a night. Took us about 20 minutes or so.  If you are a foreigner travelling on own, best thing is to time your visit with the free guided tours. We thought we would go ahead without the tour and this is something we regretted, given the size of this place and lack of signboards to tell you any historical facts and your exact location as well. We found ourselves lost for an hour, ending up at some garden, smaller palaces and the National Folk Museum and had to go one big round to come out to the entrance.  If you are planning to visit more palaces, suggest you take the Combination ticket, which will cover Gyeongbokgung, Chandeukgung, Chanseukgung (if I'm not mistaken) Deoksugung, and Jongmyo shrine which costs KRW10k (I recall it would be cheaper by KRW2k if you bought the tickets separately).  Although we were in Seoul throughout the stay and decided we should visit most, we didn't and only managed to visit this, Chandeukgung and Jongmyo shrine so the Combination ticket was not worth it but could come in handy.  I would prefer Chandeukgung, which is about 20 minutes walk away as it is much more interesting.",149,much
150,45,660,"Gyeongbokgung is the largest palace in Seoul, and I did appreciate all the structures and the grand scale of things. However, I think other palaces are much more interesting. Gyeongbokgung feels like a tourist trap and has too many visitors. The landscaping here isn't all that exciting compared to, say, Changdeokgung, which was built in harmony with nature. I would recommend visiting this palace to experience the grandeur and the guard changing ceremony, but also take a look at other palaces around Seoul.",150,much
151,46,675,"We wanted to tour Changdeokgung Palace on our last day in Seoul, but we learned too late that the only one of the five palaces open on Monday is Gyeongbokgung (which is closed on Tuesdays). So we set out in a steady rain to see what we could see.  We walked from our hotel near N Seoul Tower, maybe a 45 minute stroll. The walk would have been shorter had we known precisely where we were going.  We arrived just as the changing of the guard ceremony was ending, which was pretty cool. Their bright uniforms are impressive, and they replicate the original Josean guards' reds and blues and greens. Their somber countenances are unwavering. They'll permit you to stand close enough to take a photo, but they won't acknowledge you.  Admission is only 3000 won (about $3 US). Though Ggyeongbokgung is older than the other palaces (originally built in 1395), there isn't much left to see because the Japanese intentionally destroyed most of the buildings during the occupation. Restoration only began again in the 1990s. The exterior wall stands, as does the inner courtyard structure and the main palace building, and some smaller outlying buildings.  When it started downpouring rain, we spent some time sitting in the gift shop waiting for it to ease up. They have some really lovely artistic high quality souvenirs for sale, including pottery and inlay jewelry chests and ceramics. They're pretty pricey, but they're not trinkets. You can also buy coffee, hot cocoa, snacks.  Gyeongbokgung is lovely, but it's pretty low key if you've seen palace sites in Bangkok or Beijing. A highlight of our visit was when one of the staff insisted we ""come here"" to see what he was pointing at. You can only see the golden dragon on the ceiling from one vantage point, and he wanted to make sure we saw it and got a good photo. We'd have missed it otherwise.  We were hoping that most of the tour would be inside due to the rain. It wasn't. Because the rain wouldn't let up and our feet were already wet from traipsing across the muddy grounds, we didn't go to the water or explore the rest of the property.  Hopefully Seoul will continue restoration of this site and eventually return it to its original splendor. I'll come back and revisit it.",151,much
152,47,681,"This is the main palace and it is right in the middle of Seoul. Tickets are cheap. I think it was only $2 or something like that. Make sure to take the guided tour. Once you go past the place where you need to give your tickets, there is an office to the right. You wait outside for the tour guide. Tour times are posted outside the tour guide office as well as the ticket office. The tour lasts about an hour and takes you throughout the palace, explaining various locations and giving a lot of insight and history. The tour made our visit to the palace wonderful and we learned so much! I still can't believe that it was a free tour!  After leaving the palace we walked to Insadong and back to our hotel in Myeongdong. That's how close the palace is to everything.",152,much
153,48,682,"This is THE palace in Seoul. If you are there for the culture and history, you have to come here. Also, if you're planning to visit BOTH this palace and Changdeokgung down the street, come here FIRST!! You can get a 2 in 1 ticket deal, but only at the Gyeongbokgung ticket office. Unlike us who went to Changdeokgung first. (Dang it!) The main gate at the front (not where you get your tickets though strangely enough) is very impressive. Although we learned that it was just recently completed as the original was dismantled by the Japanese. The Japanese occupation really did a number on Korean cultural heritage and they're just getting around to finish resurrecting a lot of the structures in the palaces. So, a lot of it is not the original and so not very old at all. Unfortunately, if you go into these palaces without a tour guide it's difficult to get a sense of the history attached to the place even with a pamphlet. This palace is much grander than Changdeokgung. There are also a couple of museums attached to the grounds. Do not miss the Folk Museum!! Excellent!! We didn't have enough time to do a thorough tour of that. Also, found out way too late that we missed a whole section of the palace compound that was used as location for the K-drama ""Rooftop Prince"". (Dang it, again!!) Well, when it's so hot and you have 2 little children and severe jetlag on top of it all, you tend to run out of steam pretty quickly.",153,much
154,49,685,"This palace is actually a reconstruction of the one that used to stand here. The original dates to the Joseon Dynasty. It is only one of several in Seoul, but it was the only one that I had a chance to visit. The architecture and the decorative art inside the buildings were beautiful. As you enter, you can pick up a very thorough pamphlet which explains the purpose of each of the buildings. This was you can tour yourself around and make sure you know what you are looking for at each of the many courtyards. Pamphlets are available in many languages, including English, and are quite informative. Behind the museum is the National Folklore Museum which was well worth the visit alone. You can enter the museum only from the western palace gate. The museum is free of charge, though there is a fee for the palace. The museum gives an excellent overview of the history of people on the Korean peninsula, dating back to prehistoric times. The signs in Gallery 1 all have good English translations, so it is really easy to understand what you are looking at and make sense of the timeline of Korea's past. Gallery 2 consists mostly of artifacts, which are displayed nicely but do not have as much information in English, so I enjoyed this section of the museum less.",154,much
155,50,702,There is free hanbok wearing at the souvenir shop which was such a memorable experience! Each person has only 10 minutes to wear the hanbok as the line gets pretty much long.

Ask someone to take your photo standing in front of the nearest palace so you have a great background.,155,much

157,52,706,"If I have to compare, I would prefer Deoksugung Palace than Gyeongbokgung palace to visit during holiday. Why? Gyeongbokgung is too crowded since it's the main center of the palace to be visited by the tourists. The main attraction would be the changing of the guards, the history of the palace, the national folk museum and the national museum.  However the last time I came here I can't enjoy it that much since it's very crowded with people. Even the pictures that I took were not as beautiful as ones I took at Deoksugung. Perhaps, one suggestion, come to Gyeongbokgung during weekdays, and not in a spring, winter, or summer break. People are coming not only from Seoul but also China and Japan. I really find it unattractive in a huge commotion like that.  Nevertheless, for 3000won, this area is really worth to visit. This palace area is so huge that even 3 hours will last like a flash. And make sure, you're not coming during holiday. It'll be an awful experience.You can't really enjoy the scenery since it's too noisy and crowded.",157,much

Unfortunately there wasn’t much to see inside the palace buildings as everything has been removed.  Nevertheless, something not to miss on your Seoul holiday.

With less tourist and less heat, you can wear the Korean traditional clothes comfortably during the winter time.",172,much
173,68,901,"This is my second visit. Once in summer (no shade and very hot so I didn’t walk around much). This time in winter, I was able to walk around more. The changing of the guards is every hour, on the hour and is worth seeing. It’s free. The costumes are colourful and the drums are cool. The palace entrance is 3000 won. The grounds are expansive and besides the pavilions and buildings, it’s pretty sparse. There were plenty of people in traditional costumes taking photos. There is a folk museum too but I didn’t go in.",173,much
174,69,905,"My wife and I love attending palaces, museums etc in the countries we visit. We attended the palace and partook in the free tour. It was extremely informative and we really enjoyed it. Further more there was no request for tips or any form of payment. As the tour ended our guide thanked us for our time, wished us all the best on our holiday and then walked off. She was extremely polite and informative the entire tour and I actually felt like I wanted to tip her given how brilliant she was.  I would highly recommend taking the free tour as you get so much more out of it that just walking around yourself",174,much
175,70,909,"Definitely worth while to visit, staff very friendly to answer any question.

The ticket queue seems much longer in the afternoon when we're about to leave so start early if you can. Most of the visitors were dressed up in Hanbok costume (traditional Korean dress) where you can rent it. Do note that the guard changing ceremony is at 10am and 2pm. There's a free English Guided tour at 11am but I believe there're other timings in the afternoon as well.,178,much
179,74,936,"I would suggest to go early. So that you can get your insta-worthy shots without too much background distractions. We reached the palace around 10am-11am and it is already packed. It might be due to that I visited the palace on Sunday. Such a shame that I didn't get to watch the guard changing ceremony. Good thing that our tour guide is well versed with the history of the palace, so we don't have to use the tour provided by the palace.",179,much
180,75,944,"We enjoyed visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace very much. We were, unfortunately, there during a rainy patch. It would have been a lot more fun on a sunny day. Many visitors show up in traditional Korean dress and take photographs, which adds to the ambiance.",180,much

We went into the palace expecting to rent hanbok for the children and realized they were outside (we saw many of them when we left). Would be nice if there is a notice board or something where they can inform us where to go for the rental. If you are coming out of the palace, turn to your left towards the station. when you hit the first traffic light, you will see lots of rental shops opposite. That's the place to rent your hanbok for photo taking. The palace itself was nice but probably I was expecting more. The palaces look pretty much alike and nothing much to see for us. Probably they do not have a richer and older history as China. We practically walk everywhere in the compound and our last stop was the library where you will have to take your shoes off and be real quiet! I don't think I enjoyed unless there was an event there. If not, I think its worth to skip it unless you really want to dress in your hanbok and walk under the hot sun (yes we went in June)!",181,much
182,77,1000,We spent a few hours walking around the palace grounds. It was much bigger than we expected but the architecture was beautiful and well kept. We had a 3 year old with us and he loved exploring the countless pathways until he got tired and opted to ride in the stroller. They had many ramps around the palace so the stroller was not a problem. Overall a very worthwhile place to tour in Seoul for a step back in to history.,182,much
183,78,1002,"Compared to most our palace visit, this was uninspiring. I thought it would be much bigger, but the King's palace is very small. I don't get the barrier around the pond with windows to peek through to see the Pagoda, looks abandon.  Aside from the entrance guards, there are nothing to interact with after the guards, just a few old buildings, you can walk through this in about an hour, will be bored after the palace.  The most interesting thing was seeing all the Chinese tourists dressed in traditional attire walking around, we took pictures with a few.

The tour lasts between 1-1.5 hours depending on the size of the group and the guide. Our guide was most informative as she lead our group of about twenty five around the complex. We were told many interesting stories and facts about the life in the Royal Palace, about family members, details of the architecture and general life in the palace.

Some reviewers complain there isn't much to see here. But I guess it depends upon what your goals are.Yes, the buildings are mostly closed or empty. But the way the palace is built with exposure to weather with unheated buildings, it is understandable why they won't be full of ancient artifacts. You'll find those in museums nearby. I have been here probably five times going back over 30 years, and I never cease to find it a place to calmly reflect on Korea's ancient and interesting history as a keystone located in the heart of East Asia. Additionally, you will find two great museums within its boundary. A great place for leisurely walks and quiet thinking (except on Korean holidays!).",189,much

The walk back from the rear of the grounds takes you past a number of small art galleries. Avoid the weekend if possible as there are many tour groups.",196,much

What a stunning palace and what an amazing opportunity for anyone to learn so much about a country's history that no school would ever teach. Visiting this palace was one of the best things I have ever done for myself. This visit made me realize just how little we learn about Asian history in the West and I lamented this but welcomed and enjoyed the opportunity to remedy this sad reality at least a little by learning as much as I could.  I was so impressed by the meticulous care of this historical place. Authorities in Seoul ought to be applauded for their exceptional care of this historical jewel. This is not a place you can visit in just an hour or two. Take your time! See all the details, read everything, learn and enjoy! It'll transport you to ancient times long gone and to such a different culture and world you could never imagine unless you went there yourself. We spent an entire day here and loved everything, from the unique and delicate gardens, to the royal chambers of the king, the superb collections of antiques that show different times in Korean history. The pagodas are exquisite, the details of the architecture, even the small village of their servants provided a clear contrast that showed how differently their servants lived within the palace. We also marveled at the great contrast between this ancient structure next The the modern city surrounding it. Absolutely magnificent!",197,much

Because that friend insisted on paying for my ticket for me, I don't actually know how much it costs. But I found out from people there that if you go to one of the Hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) stores nearby and pay to rent Hanbok (which you can do, prices vary depending on the outfit you choose and how long you want to borrow it, I borrowed the ""cheap"" outfit for 2 hours and it was 20,000 Won (~$20)) you can enter the palace for free. So it was quite cool, as we walked around the palace, there were people everywhere wearing the traditional Korean palace clothing! Bless their hearts though, that day was HOT. If you come to the palace in the summer, be prepared for that... I was not... lol. Overall it's a gorgeous place to visit and a lovely walk during the day. There's a mini museum/cafe/information center/gift shop near the main building of the palace, so you can go there and enjoy some A/C if you're dying in the heat (like I was). There are also a lot of cute cafes and restaurants nearby that you can go to, with delicious food!

Both female and male handbook available.  Once you wear a handbook, entrance is free!!! Great time to photo shoot. Even locals wanted a picture with us may be because we were wearing our hijab with the Hanbok. The weather was hot and we were perspiring a lot in that thick and heavy hanbok. Bring your bottle of water along coz there isn't any shops inside the palace.  The palace is so huge, took us 2 hours to explore most of it.

To get the full traditional Korean experience, you can rent Hanbok (traditional Korean clothing) from many stores near the palace. During the summer, I recommend visiting the palace at night.

Palace is huge and will be even more pretty I believe during the Autumn period. One can spend at least 3 hours covering the whole palace so it will be good to go during a cooler day.

208,103,1265,"The first attraction we visited upon arrival to Seoul. It was winter so it was not crowded at all (though, I've never been there during the other seasons) so you can take time in taking photos and just walk. Just as the other tourist attractions in South Korea, the palace is well maintained, toilets and surroundings are clean, tourist information areas are present, and English tourist maps and guides are provided.  Admission fee is KRW3000 but you can get a discount if you're visiting in group of at least 10. Good thing is, if you have enough time, there is an integrated ticket which you can purchase for KRW10,000 and entitles you to visit the other major palaces and temples in Seoul.  The best thing about the attractions in Seoul is the location. The attractions are pretty much close to each other, hence they are easy to find, especially if your using the subway. The National Folk Museum is located just next to Gyeongbokgung, and you can visit the place for free. You can visit other nearby Museums after, head to Bukchon Hanok Village and stroll at Insadong and Samcheongdong afterwards. Then you can take pictures at the Gwanghwamun gate as you head off to the subway on your way home (what we did, since we entered the Gwanghwamun Subway Station as we got back home).  **If you don't mind long walks, it's better to walk from one attraction to next. **Just make sure to wear your winter clothes to keep you warm as it gets really cold especially when it's windy. Bet you don't wanna spoil your tour when you're busy keeping yourself warm. :)  If you plan to visit Changdeokgung, I suggest you alot another day for that to appreciate, then you can go to Jongmyo Shrine after. You can also exchange Changdeokgung and Gyeongbokgung. Both are near Bukchon Hanok and Insadong-Samcheongdong",208,much

There is a change of traditional palace guard parade that had explanations in English, Mandarin and Japanese; very interesting to watch and understand.  The palace itself is quite a big compound and well preserved and restored. I would have preferred that there were more directional signages and explanations of the various locations of the palace. I did not see any maps for visitors to take along (maybe I missed it), hence, some places that I walked had nothing much to view. The lack of explanation boards at the various locations made my visit a purely sightseeing trip, so for those who want some history, either get a guide book or a guided tour.",210,much

One piece of advice I have is to arrive about 15 mins to the hour - this way it will give you enough time to buy tickets and watch the guards changing (happens on the hour) which will then give you ample time to roam the very spacious palatial grounds. This way you don't have to rush to the entrance if you are somewhere else in the compound to watch the change of guards.  I very much enjoyed the palace - we went in the morning and would recommend you do this to avoid the crowds as this is a tourist hot spot. This way you can get lots of photos without people in the way. Having said that the Gyeongbokgung Palace is HUGE - we just avoided the crowds by walking around the outside first where you can admire all the foyer and ceiling art followed by walks next to the water gardens which are a lovely place to admire the wildlife among the water lilies.  If you can allocate at least two hours to walk around the grounds - it's very scenic and clean - if I lived in Seoul I would come here for the peace and quiet alone, not to mention it is a great workout if you visit every part of the compound.  A must-see and notable attraction if you have time on your trip - it's easily accessible by Subway and not far from other hot spots in the city.",212,much

There is so much history to absorb both in visual and audible form. The details on the decor, roof structure & building design are awe inspiring. Each detail, whether it be the shape of the roof, the colour combination of the ceiling beams, the setting of rooms (with heating options), is so meaningful. Like the other palaces, this is meticulously restored. You can almost feel the presence of royals and the troops within the palace. The place however seems squeezed by the sprawling metropolis though once within its perimeter, one can enjoy the peaceful and serene atmosphere. One thing notable is that unlike Changdeokgung Palace, which is of Korean architecture (entrance walkway is crooked), this palace is of Chinese design (entrance walkway is straight).",217,much

In other words, it is possible to see come of the city's rich history even if you don't have much time to spare. The palace is an commanding structure and gives a real sense of the wealth and sophistication of Korea at the time when Europe was still emerging from the Middle Ages. But, the thing that we found most impressive was the pride and patriotism shown by the Korean people, many of whom were dressed in colourful, traditional costume.

There are also plaques all around that explain the buildings and it is worth looking up online before you go, but I wouldn't pay for a tour. I was teaching in Seoul and took my family (who was visiting) here in July of 2015 and they enjoyed it but once you have seen one palace in Korea you have seen them all.

Well I'm pleased to be able to report that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I had a good walk around Gyeongbokgung Palace and also popped in to the Korean Museum of Folk Culture next door.  I found the Palace very interesting and rather impressive (I did not do a guided tour, I just walked round by myself). Entry is 3000 Won (around US$3, GBP£2) which is absolutely excellent value for money. There were quite a lot of locals there in traditional and very colorful dress, which really brightened the experience.  It took me 2 hours to have a really good look around and take my photos. The Folk Museum I mentioned earlier I do not recommend. I spent just 5-10 minutes in there and it will certainly be of much more interest to Koreans than to visitors. Nevertheless, entry was free so I'm not complaining... just advising!  I notice more than one review comparing Gyeongbokgung Palace with the Forbidden City in Beijing. Gyeongbokgung Palace is much smaller (although still occupying quite a large area) but quite similar in its layout and appearance. Please don't go to Gyeongbokgung Palace hoping or expecting to find an equal of the Forbidden City, but I think you will find something equally as interesting although rather less dramatic in scale.  The day I visited the weather was sunny. I would not advise going on a rainy day, I think that would totally spoil your visit.  Overall, very highly recommended.",224,much

If you can borrow audio service device, try one. You won't regret it. It's much more interesting when you know the background. Its admission fee is reasonable like KRW 3000(= USD $2), but it's free if you wear Korean traditional custom. There are many rental shop near the palace. Don't miss it.

Bring plenty of food and water, don't forget to charge your camera and good shoes. Not much refreshments available on the premises so come prepared. If you want to wear a hanbok dress, there are plenty of shops where you can hire them for 1.5hrs - 2 hrs outside the palace. I believe the prices start on 15000 KWR for 1.5hrs. It's a great opportunity to take your pictures in this wonderful setting and ""IN style"" throughout the complex. Definitely worth a visit is also the Folklore Museum with its wonderful restorations of Korean past. The Korean Folklore village's reconstruction is very illustrative and worth a visit for every foreigner. The museum is within a complex and the entry is free. If you need to wind down, there is a small garden towards the north of the complext where you can e.g. let the kids to let some steam out. It's very tranquil there and with offers lovely views. Free 1hr long guided tours are offered on the hour at the entrance. We left the palace by one of the side entrances and enjoyed a well deserved meal in a small restaurant in Bukchon. Great day out.",230,much
231,126,1415,Th building is beautiful and has a lot of history - not very much liked by the Japanese because of the way they treated the koreans in the past.,231,much
232,127,1418,"The site, the palace structures and the gardens were beautiful. However, I would say there wasn't much to see. Most of the palace housings were locked and those that were open had few or no exhibits within. Going free and easy without a guide will not give you much insight into the Korean traditions or palace life.  However, if you wear a hanbok to the palace, you will be granted free entry. There is a hanbok rental a few minutes walk from the train station. If the weather permits, wearing a hanbok would be a really good idea as you can be assured that your pictures will turn out fabulous. There is no need to feel embarassed as well as many visitors do that :)",232,much
233,128,1425,"This is the bigger of the 2 imperial palaces. Personally, I like the other one. Go see this one just because that's what you do; just like one visits the Statue of Liberty in nyc because that's what you do when you are in nyc. Just a bunch of buildings that very much resemble Chinese palaces. One cannot go in the building, just stand outside and look in through the openings. They do try to make up for it by having re enactments and ""changing of the guard"" type ceremony.",233,much
234,129,1426,Booked a free Seoul walking tour for this palace. There were a lot of people over the weekend. However the palace is beautiful. The tour enhanced the palace experience adding much depth to the visual experience of this place. Although this palace was restored it doesn't diminish its importance to Korea and how crucial it has been to the existence of this nation.  The changing of guard ceremony is something not to be missed. It provides an experiential bridge to its glorious past and is one of the highlights of this palace visit.,234,much
235,130,1435,Second time to see the palace. Absolutely love it. I don't know much about Korean history but it is still well worth the visit. Admission is cheap. Very picturesque. Not grand and awe inspiring like Beijing's forbidden city but certainly more picturesque. Museum within the grounds worth a look as well.,235,much
236,131,1438,"I wasn't expecting much because I had been there before on a tour package (too rushed). But this time I went free&easy with friends and had time to explore the palace grounds. There was such a beautiful calm as I took in the sights of the palace architecture, the trees, ponds, mountains...that my heart was moved. I will recommend a leisurely pace to explore the place, then walk to tosokchon for some good ginseng chicken soup.",236,much
237,132,1445,"I went at the start of April where the Sakura flowers were in full bloom,it was absolutely beautiful in the palace filled with ancient architecture and plenty of flowers around,just that it is pretty packed with tourists,do search for the change of guard duties timings to go,that's when it gets abit more interesting,they have little tours to explain to you about the palace,if you are not interested,that's okay,just walk around ,feel like royalty and take in the pretty views.another side note,if you wear the traditional hanbok in,u get free entrance and great pictures,you can rent it at nearby stores,the last I have heard,it was 15k won for four hours rental,pretty much a good deal.have fun!",237,much
238,133,1453,"If you are in Seoul, that's the Nr. 1 not to be missed part of the city. Fanastic experience, felt myself in the ancient time. Perfect if you are on business trip and just have a few hours till your transfer to the airport. Main entrance is recommended to use for entry - but for exit, it is much more better to use the side one which takes you to the Bukchon Hanok Village which has been a traditional residential area for 600 years. Full of traditional and modern small houses, cafes, shops, unforgettable epxerience walking on the small streets of it!",238,much
239,134,1491,"We got lucky and visited on a Saturday when there were volunteer tour guides available (and they spoke English). It was amazing! We learned so much while we were there and the palace itself, even though it had to be reconstructed (that is a very sad part of their history) is absolutely stunning! It is amazing they were able to build such a place.",239,much
240,135,1493,"A nice palace, and also the change of guard duty are interesting. Also, you can try on to be the guard duty by trying their uniform! It's cool!

241,136,1504,"The Royal Palace is a must see when in Seoul but give yourself plenty of time because there's a lot to see. Upon arrival, don't be discouraged if there are a lot of people out front. Once inside, you won't notice them because the Palace sits on a sizable amount of land. It's also incredibly quiet inside, which was amazing because there is much traffic and noise right outside. There a many buildings to see when inside the gate and try to see the pavilion in the moat off to the left. This is a beautiful area. Make sure you look up while looking inside the buildings as well and outside the buildings. There are many detailed carvings and paintings all around. The grounds are beautifully manicured as well and very clean. We didn't receive a map when we arrived so you may want to get some info off the internet before you go. I believe there are several hundred buildings to see. There is a gift shop and museum. There are also live soldiers posing out front as statues.",241,much
242,137,1508,"Well, there is really nothing much to rave about in this palace. Maybe because I have been to other asian palaces and therefore have high expectation. Though I must say that the free tour guide provided at the information centre is very good. It gives an insight to the palace and gives understanding to some of the building structures, such as chimney towers that are not noticeable. Heating under the building provided via tunnels.  To its defence, I supposed because the palace was burnt down during the early Japanese/Korean war, much of the original details in the palace was missing. There is not much grandeur that you would expect from a royal palace.  It is still a good place to visit to understand the historical way of life of the monarch during that time.  Check out the free tour time table to ensure that you do not wait too long.",242,much
243,138,1509,"we went there with my husband during summer time.i wouldnt recommend going there summer time as it is super hot,dry and humid. You'll be walking so much. I love seeing the palace and walk around but i wish they had more stuff inside the big palace for us to see and we could go inside. But this place is a must! Just go one time.",243,much
244,139,1514,"So much fun, what a great piece of history! Do the guided tour to learn more about the culture and how Korea became. There is also a area where you can dress up as a guard right when you walk in on the left... Must do!! Find the falic garden.... Great place for pictures!",244,much
245,140,1521,"I've been to this palace twice--first time was in October 2012 and the second time was just recently, October 2015. I didn't enter the palace ground anymore on my second trip because it's going to be the same. I just wanted to see the ""Changing of the Guards Ceremony"" again. This time, at around 4PM. The ceremony I witness before was the one in the morning--the complete/full version. Although the one in the afternoon was much shorter, it didn't really take away from the experience of seeing these men all dressed up in their soldier/warrior attires. If you've been to the inner palace once, you don't really have to spend money on another ticket to see it again. It still the same palace building and, architecturally, looks very similar to the other palaces. Most definitely a good place to visit for first-timers in Seoul. A good stop the second time around; however, I don't see myself going back here on my third trip to Korea. I'm giving it a 4 out of 5,nonetheless. Still a very beautiful place to view.",245,much
246,141,1523,"A vast area with a lot of very pretty but closed buildings. There were some you could look into, but most of the buildings seemed like empty shells. Very beautiful buildings though. Not many places to get something to eat, and not really much to see. Maybe a guided tour would have been more informative, but I really loathe guided tours - so that's not an option for me. It didn't feel like totally wasted time, but I will never visit again.",246,much
247,142,1532,"Living 5mn away, I went multiple times there, during snowy winter, chilly fall, warm summer and beautiful spring. Year around, the place is nice. Don't expect to see anything similar to Forbidden city in Beijing, this is different, this is much smaller, but very enjoyable. Do the Folks Museum, this is very under rated, and quite nice to learn about Korea. I enjoyed nearby the Queen Palace very much, best in WINTER to see the white landscape. Enjoy your time there and forget/relax from the busy city around.",247,much
248,143,1536,"My parents and i visited this Palace on the last Wednesday of the month and entrance fee was waived! We also enjoyed free traditional music performance at the National Palace Museum (which was also free entrance) and had an interesting time at the Folk Museum within the compound (which was also free entrance). You can easily spend a whole afternoon here if you enjoy photography of outdoor architecture and korean culture, or if the weather is good. I visited in September when the weather was turning from hot (with occasional rain) to cool (with sunny days) so if I could visit again I would prefer to go in early Oct. The palace is more beautiful than Deoksugung and much larger as well. You should also visit Jongmyo Shrine for a complete historical learning experience. Wear comfortable shoes (some of the paths are uneven and difficult to walk on); advisable to visit the toilet when you come across one as you are exploring the palace grounds, because toilets are not very conveniently located (only 2, one at the entrance and one at the exit, as well as at the 2 co-located museums which have cleaner toilets). You may wish to bring along a bottle of drinking water; if you need a refill, there are free drinking water fountains within the compound near the toilets and even in resting areas.",248,much

We were there by 1pm and witnessed the royal changing of guard! The guards could stand so still despite the hot weather! We were deeply impressed!  The palace is huge and it requires good stamina and great deal of time if you wanna explore the whole site. Furthermore, it's connected to the National Folks Museum, and there are also small little houses for you to enter! Try to enter all of them, some even provide free photo taking services and you will be surprised! Haha.",251,much
252,147,1558,This palace is so big and aroubd every corner there is a hidden teasure. It's rich in history and stunning to strole through.  Little kids can run around but will get bored after a little while since there isn't much that will facinate their brains.  If you visit keep in mind that Jul/Aug is Monsoon time so it might start raining whilst you're there. Take an umbrella incase and go enjoy.  You could also have a small picnic there i think.,252,much

Prepare to cringe a few times if you're Japanese -- the history includes some serious unpleasantness, like the occasion when Japan sent 60 guys to assassinate the empress. But you'll still enjoy the tour -- I think! The guides are friendly and knowledgeable. As an American with almost no knowledge of the Korean language, I certainly liked the tour.",253,much
254,149,1566,"Gyeongbokgung is the largest royal palace in Seoul and was the main royal palace for much of the Joseon (Choson) dynasty; that alone may or may not be enough to appeal to potential visitors. There are two really great things to see here, though: the changing of the guard with Joseon dynasty-costumed guards and the National Palace Museum, which is really worth an hour or two, filled as it is with interesting and beautiful art and artifacts. After you see Gyeongbokgung, make sure to see Toksegung (Daeksogung or Duksoo) Palace & the Secret Garden (Piwon) of Changdaekgung Palace as well. But just outside Gyeongbokgung's gate, Gwanghwamun, is a huge plaza with statues of King Sejong and Admiral Yi Sunshin, Korea's two greatest heroes; there's a small museum focusing on them located below the plaza that's worth an hour. And you should go back to Gyeongbokgung at sunset see Gwanghwamun at dusk, when it is at its most beguiling and photogenic.",254,much
255,150,1573,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is absolutely huge, but after a while all of the buildings start to look very similar. The first part of the palace is the most interesting: Gwanghwamun Gate, the large paved courtyards and the throne room are truly impressive. After the first 3 or 4 buildings I got bored very quickly and found that the rest of the palace consisted of nothing more than empty rooms in near identical buildings. The only features of interest past the initial cluster of buildings were the small lake with the garden island (behind the main palace) and the large pavilion for official entertaining on a large lake to the west of the main section of palace buildings. A lack of clear signage made it hard to find where to go next. I spent an hour and a half wandering around until I lost interest but you could easily spend much more time here if you wanted to. I was a bit disappointed that the palace is largely just empty buildings you can only see from the outside - it is hard to appreciate the rich history of Korea when one buildings looks the same as the one you just saw. Changdeokgung Palace had more character and was much prettier. The Changing of the Guard happens regularly and is a good show, but not as interesting as the one at Deoksugung Palace.",255,much

Not much tourist so we got to take awesome pics.  We did not stay too long, but was able to see the Changing of the Guard and went inside for some pics.

And plus, the place is so huge and buildings are placed quite far apart, so there were lots of walking. Ended up I spent about 4 hours, barely covering the few main buildings and the garden with the lake in the middle. Lots of photospots, either the Maingate, guards, main courtyard, inner gate and the list goes on.. it just never ends. I went on a warm and bright autumn day, so it was good. All the time spent here will be outdoor, so if you're going in the winter of in the colder days of spring and autumn, then better be prepared.",260,much
261,156,1638,"Headed here on an organised tour. The palace is huge while you could happily wander through here alone although a tour guide adds so much more to the history and way the place was constructed and operates, I would recommend it.  The changing of the gate guard ceremony is at 10am, worthwhile seeing, lots of flags music and colors. The palace gets a bit crowded after this time as all the tour groups start to go through. It wasn't that crowded though.  We visited, at the end of March, the cherry blossoms were starting to come out, though will in full bloom in a week or two  Defiantly worth seeing.",261,much
262,157,1639,This Palace was so much larger than expected. Saturdays you can see changing of the guards in traditional Korean uniforms from Joseon Dynasty Period. For cost of admission (1.50 US) you get access to Palace Museum. This is a primarily outdoor walk through of the grounds- be prepared to walk quite a bit but plenty of areas to rest. Beautiful parklike setting in center and Folk Museum close enough to visit as well (separate admission).,262,much
263,158,1647,"Due to the history with Japan, much of this does not date back to the 1300's but instead the 18/1900's. Regardless it is very cheap to tour and the grounds are beautiful/massive. Worth the 2-3 hours to do it justice. Try to catch the changing of the guards.",263,much
264,159,1653,Tours in English run at set times. Definitely worth doing it as there isn't much signage and what would seem like a whole bunch of buildings would be unappreciated without the history and stories.  Not ideal destination in the rain as there's not much shelter.,264,much

Though less comparable with the great palaces of Beijing, Tokyo and Osaka, nevertheless they have much to offer in terms of the nation's history.  Toilets are not abound so make you attend to your needs before wandering around. I love the ornate roofs and the well preserve timber frames but again will not be drawn into comparison with the Forbidden City of Beijing.  The other dampener you will face is this place seems to be a must visit for every tourist to Seoul. The result is this could get overcrowding including the q for the women's toilets. I did not see the changing of the guards as we were on a free transit tour but that would be somewhat colourful as with when they are filming costume/period Korean dramas.",266,much

Having visited the Forbidden City and having heard this was the Korean equivalent, we thought we would end up seeing pretty much the same thing. Given we did not enjoy or like the Forbidden City all that much, that was worrisome.  Luckily, despite similar styles (due to Korean history) we thoroughly enjoyed the visit to the palace. It is extremely accessible and it does not feel like you are seeing the same building or pavilion over and over again. It also did not feel particularly crowded at all and it was very easy to navigate. The grounds of the palace were also extremely nice to stroll in and it was definitely an added bonus to have the National Folk Museum adjoining to the palace. Even extra added bonus, the entrance/exit closest to the National Folk Museum is a stone throw away from the Bukchon area.  Definitely recommended and would suggest to take half a day to visit the palace itself, the grounds and the National Folk Museum.",267,much

Nevertheless, an eye opener for first timers.  I went there during December, as the place is covered with mud and melted snow, it gets quite dirty for your shoes as well as for your legs (jeans).

But the Japanese invaded Korea once again in early 20th century and almost all the buildings were destroyed. After the WW2 some of the most important parts were once again rebuilt. Nowadays it looks quite good. If you don't have much time, you should see this palace as the representative of the 4 royal palaces in Seoul.

284,179,1814,"In the entire leadup to our Korea trip, Gyeongbokgung seemed like it would be THE palace to visit. Strangely enough, I feel like it may have been the one that we least explored. That may be due to the enormous size of the palace grounds. I also wasted too much time photographing the front areas of the palace and underestimated how much time was left in the day. You can really spend hours at Gyeongbokgung just relaxing in the various areas the palace has to offer.  While we were in front by Gwanghwamun gate, we saw some sort of guard ceremony. At the time, I thought it was their ""changing of the guard,"" but now that I'm seeing Youtube videos of the full ceremony, it can't have been it. Luckily, we caught the full ""changing of the guard"" at Deoksugung, so I'm good on that.  Based on my limited anecdotal knowledge, it seems like Gyeongbokgung is the most popular palace to visit. It's right off the main city square and it has the impressive Gwanghwamun gate to mark the main entrance. If you can only visit one palace, I'd probably recommend Changdeokgung with its beautiful Secret Garden and slightly smaller crowds. However, Gyeongbokgung is enormous and impressive.

Take your time to stroll the gardens to take the city stress away. Try on the guards uniform for a fun photo taking at no costs.

Take a camera of course and be prepared to walk away with hundreds of wonderful compositions from magnificant architectural roofs to detailed close-ups of ancient fixtures and doors. Well worth spending a half a day exploring preceded by and with a follow on late lunch or early dinner. High noon is the spectacle of spectacles with the changing of the guards, so don;t miss it. One of many palaces in and around Seoul but in my humble opinion the best preserved and most professionaly presented and maintained.",287,much
288,183,1851,"Went here during the obligatory tourist day of a business trip to Seoul.  We watched the changing of the guard shortly after arriving at 10. A few people brightly dressed as traditional korean warriors marched around a bit but didn't really do much else.  Pretty impressive overall though and a fairly large complex to explore. We had a group tour guide who was full of interesting information about the place, which brought it to life a bit more.  Some of it is original but much has been extensively restored, but done in a sympathetic manor.  I guess it depends how much you like this sort of place but we took about 1.5 hours to see all the major bits of the complex and I thought that was enough.",288,much
289,184,1854,"I'm in awe with the size and scale of this palace. I'm also so very happy I dropped the 3000 Won for the audio guide. It was highly informative and provided me with a much richer experience than if I'd just bumbled through the place. For a moment I stopped to listen to the free tour and it seemed quite worthwhile, too, providing even more color than the audio guide. I would recommended it if you're into a slightly more structured walk. My favorite part? Hyangwonejong in the back - a phenomenally beautiful pagoda and pond. I could have spent hours there.",289,much
290,185,1855,"This is the meaning of the word Gyeongbokgung and it fits the palace so well. I arranged for a two day stopover in Seoul and checked online for places of interest. This was on the top of my list. I arrived in Seoul and stayed at the Sky Hotel which had free shuttle service and was two blocks from the metro for downtown Seoul. Excellent location!!! Took the metro to the Palace and arrived just in time for the changing of the guards which was absolutely beautiful and very entertaining with music, costumes, drums, marching bands, etc. I enjoyed it so much that after I toured the palace and grounds, I stayed for the next guard change which is on the hour. The Seoul metro makes it very easy to get around the city and it is very reasonable also. Two days was enough time to see most of the important sights of the city. Food was delicious esp. the area called the Samcheongdong with its wonderful street food. Also went to the Jeongdong theatre for the ""Miso"" showing (full house). You can take a city bus tour (hop on, hop off) for only ten US dollars, I real bargain!!!",290,much
291,186,1862,"A much more compact place than the Changdeogung Palace but main buidlings-wise, more or less comparable. But what sets it apart is the secret garden area which gives you a good impression of what it was like hundereds of years ago. Most buildings here are original and not rebuild as in the other places. Do take the English tour because it gives so much inside info on this attraction. A plus !",291,much
292,187,1865,"We arrived at Gyeongbokgung Palace around lunch time, it was very hot and too much glare from the sun. Maybe its better to go in the afternoon and in time for the English-speaking tour guide but there are free English booklets that you can read while walking around the palace.  There is also the Gogungddurak museum shop and cafe where we had our lunch.",292,much
293,188,1870,All visitors to Seoul should stop by this palace. Very amazed by the grandeur of the structures and the beauty of the architecture. Be sure to come on a cooler day as we visited during a heat wave and found ourselves dripping with sweat. Also do not make the mistake of spending too much time at the main gate and the first palace building as it is only a small part of the overall complex.,293,much
294,189,1878,"This is my favorite of all the palaces in Seoul! The buildings are beautiful...there is so much to see. The changing of the guard ceremony is something not to be missed. My favorite spot is the small pond in the way back of the grounds.(Hyangwon-jeong) The day we were there, there we lilly pads in the pod. The pictures we took of the pond, gazebo and mountain in the background were breathtaking!",294,much
295,190,1880,"The palace is pretty big, though once you have visited one palace, the rest looks pretty much similiar. Though they tell a different story. And so a guided tour helps or the guide booklet that is made available at the palance entrance. There are various activites that happens within the grounds of the palace. Depending on the time of the day, you will be able to experience the changing of guards at the entrance of the palace. There are some family oriented activities available within the palace vicinity as well.  The amazing thing about the palace is that it sits beautifully against Mount Namsan and the Han River.",295,much
296,191,1886,"Yes, this palace has been reconstructed but the innovative South Koreans had no alternative if they wanted to rightly showcase their proud history.  The guards at the main gate were incredibly still as tourists posed beside them.  The 1100 changing of the guard was impressive: much music amid solemn ceremony and marching.  The Palace's reconstructed buildings occupy a large area. Reconstruction is ongoing with some traditional cottages being built.  The entrance fee (KRW3000 was particularly good value). One can combine this with a visit to the free National Folk Museum.  Don't come on Tuesdays: it is closed.",296,much
297,192,1895,"One of five palaces in Seoul, it has been fully restored. It's a large fenced complex with many different buildings. Most of the buildings cannot be entered, but some, including the throne room, have the doors open so you can see inside. Do take the video tour, it has a built in GPS so the narration automatically starts as you approach each viewing point. The changing of the guards, every hour on the hour, is colourful and worth seeing. My favourite parts were the stone animal statues and the large pavilion set in the water.  Probably not interesting to small children as there's a lot of walking and not much to do.",297,much
298,193,1898,"I'm not a history or culture enthusiast, but visiting Seoul is not complete if you dont visit all those palaces. It's nice because it was my first timer, what you expect will be the colourful unique designs. Excellent for photo taking and memorable photo of Seoul trip. nothing much to see and expect on the changing of guard , just a procession with colourful guard marching and playing traditional musical instruments. easily accessible by subways (Gwanghamon or Geongbukgung st).",298,much
299,194,1938,"Between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung, i prefer Gyeongbokgung, as there is more to see and the secenary was much better.  There is also the guard changing ceremony that happens every hours in front of the palace and if u want have some good food. At Gyeongbokgung station exit 2 there is Tosokchon (토속촌) the famous Samgyetang shop which even the president of korea patronises.  So all in all a good all round place to visit.",299,much
300,195,1941,"I am quite surprise when I reached this palace. I don't have much expectation as I thought this is just a palace with buildings and garden. What surprise me is the surrounding scenery. What a beautiful place! I went there during autumn, and the leaves are so beautiful, especially the scenery near the lake. The ticket is quite cheap. Worth visiting!",300,much
301,196,1942,"Gyeongbukgung is the crown jewel of Seoul's collection of royal palaces, with complete access at no more than a few US dollars. You could honestly spend all day wandering its huge expanse, there's just so much history there and so many different styles of architecture to appreciate as well. Besides the main pavilions, I recommend seeing the Hyangwonjeong Pavilion towards the north gate and the Gyeonghoeru (Royal Banquet Hall), set on water. But honestly, its worth it to just take your time and wander through the whole thing leisurely and read the posted information along the way. I loved Gyeongbukgung so much I went twice during my trip! On a side note, do not miss either the National Palace Museum (separate 1,000W admission) or National Folk Museum attached to Gyeongbukgung.",301,much
302,197,1947,"I'd like to start off by saying that I'm a history buff - especially the dynasties of East Asian countries. Having read so much good reviews, I made this palace my top priority during my visit. To say that I was disappointed would have been an understatement. It was like a palace on a budget. Don't go expecting the splendor of a bygone era. The sprawling grounds are filled with identical buildings with little to differentiate from one to another. Even my poor hard-working tour guide was hard put to infuse much enthusiasm into the group which had gone there with so much anticipation.",302,much
303,198,1948,"When in Seoul as a tourist this is the #1 attraction. When on business and having 1-2 hours spare time during the day or weekend, visit this place. Although reconstructed after much destruction by the Japanese colonists and relatively simple for a palace, the overall experience is great and the grounds make for a nice walk. Entry WRN 3,000. Be prepared for herds of tourists though during weekends & holidays, so probably during the week is a better experience. When I was there in August it was quite warm but above all very humid, so prepare for some serious sweating while walking the grounds. The National Folk museum in the back on the right is OK, if you have another hour and to cool off, but more interesting for locals than for foreigners. Entry for the museum is free. Showing your palace ticket will let you enter the palace grounds again.",303,much
304,199,1961,"I wasn't expecting much, but the history and details of this place impressed me. It is a large complex with many buildings. Each building has a unique and interesting purpose. Go with a guide.",304,much
305,200,1972,such an amazing place to visit. we got a chance to wear a hanbok and moved around the palace..like we transfered back to Joseon Dynasty..love the feeling so much.,305,much
306,201,1977,"Gyeongbokgung Palace was the first and largest of the royal palaces built during the Joseon Dynasty. Built in 1395, Gyeongbokgung Palace was located at the heart of newly appointed capital of Seoul (then known as Hanyang) and represented the sovereignty of the Joseon Dynasty.  Beautiful architecture and they restore the building quiet well after the first palace was invaded by the Japanese back in 1945 - 1948 where Korea was attack, much of the building in the palace was run down and destroyed, they were moved to the second palace in Cheongdeokgung Palace.  There were beautiful matching presentation to shows how the army and General March during the dynasty and how they serve the king during Joseon Dynasty. Lovely wonderful place ☺️☺️☺️",306,much
307,202,1989,"It’s alright. Not much to see. There isn’t a lot of activities, it’s mostly just different areas of the palace",307,much
308,203,1990,"The entire area is huge! We kinda in rush on our trip as we want to see the guard changing order which was scheduled at 10am and we have book a tour at another palace at 1130am so we didnt have much time to explore the area. When we were there, it was raining the night before and the water turns ice in the morning!",308,much
309,204,1992,"When we arrived at the gates of the palace we were ushered inside the palace walls for a ceremony. Such good timing especially as the ceremony took less than ten minutes. Every 4th Wednesday is a special day and it is free to go in. There were lots of people in National dress looking very fine all glittering hooped skirts for the ladies and over large tall hats for the men. If you wear National Dress on any day it is also free to go in. The ground was very uneven and may be tricky for elderly to walk on. The grounds are massive, there was so much to see. It was originally built in 1395 and served as the home of Kings of the Joseon dynasty, and been extensively restored after various conflicts all but destroyed it. Well worth a visit. Take plenty of water and good walking shoes.",309,much
310,205,2008,"This is probably the most popular attraction in Seoul for both tourists and locals. It was very busy and everywhere there were people wearing national dress (hired from shops in the area). We timed our arrival for the changing of the guard which happens twice per day, it was colourful but not too serious. The palace covers a vast area and comprises a complex set of impressive buildings which are loosely interconnected. Most of the rooftops are highly decorated following the style of most historic buildings in Seoul but they have obviously been restored recently. The price of entry was very cheap although the secret garden is an additional cost (we didn't have time to go there). Just next door is another royal palace, Changgyeonggung, which was much quieter and is on a smaller scale but has lovely gardens.",310,much
311,206,2011,Arrived here just in time for the changing of the guard and were glad we caught it as the spectacle of the different costumes is not to be missed. If you plan to see the other palaces too get the Royal Palace pass - it doesn't save you much money but it does mean you don't have to queue up for tickets again so saves a lot of time. Lots of beautiful buildings to wander around.,311,much
312,207,2026,"While this palace complex is similar in layout to the Forbidden City in Beijing, it is much smaller and less grand. If you visit on the hour you can see the changing of the guard ceremony. The costumes reflect the period when this was the Korean capital. This ceremony was worth the visit alone.",312,much
313,208,2042,"If you would like just to have a look at the neighbourhood, the grand palace and people strolling with their traditional hanbok, you can just stay outside and take wonderful pictures without having to soend your money getting inside as there were not so much to see.",313,much
314,209,2077,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is a lovely place to visit and take photos, especially if you rent Hanbok (traditional Korean outfits). It doesn't cost much to visit, maybe 3000 won, but if you rent Hanbok you can get in for free and take awesome photos.",314,much
315,210,2090,"This palace is huge. The buildings are lovely. Not much to see inside them. Very cool though. Plan several hours if you want to see everything. The changing of the guards is something I only saw at this palace and was nice to see. Crowded toward the front, but far fewer people toward the back. Good view of the ""blue palace"" from the back gate. Gwanghwamun on the purple line is the subway stop I used.",315,much
316,211,2108,"If you want to see a Korean templethings, this would be Your place to visit. At the time of our visit, there was things under maintenance, but it did not bother too much.",316,much
317,212,2119,"This was the first, largest and the main royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty. It was destroyed during the Japanese occupation and has taken much time and effort to be rebuilt and restored. The Changing of the Guard happened while I was there at about 9:30am. Free admission to even foreigner seniors. Many of the girls and some boys even wore the hanbok costumes for Instagram photos. From here one can go to the Folk Museum and then on to Bukchon Hanbok Village and then the Chandeokgong Palace which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Expect to spend many hours exploring this whole area as it is well worth it. Moving on from there take in lunch on Insadong Street and browse the shops. This will be such a day well spent in Seoul.",317,much
318,213,2132,"The entrance, main palace and the palace museum are a must see (KW3000 entrance fee). The changing of the guards is an added bonus if you happen to be on time for the event. Note that the palace is expansive which require a lot of walking on stone path and gravel. There are not much shaded tress and places to rest expect around buildings. So an early morning visit is recommended. I made a reservation for an English guided tour of the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion only be disappointed as the tour guide decided to conduct it in the local vernacular. I did inquire though as she stated that she can give me a 10 minute English guide after she is done with the group but left before she finished.",318,much
319,214,2160,"I decided to go by the day tour, you might miss the best part of this castle. I visit two times; one time with the day tour and the other time by myself.  In day tour, the guide will give you an explanation about the place, the history of the castle, and such. But then again,you have Google and every part of the castle have a short yet detailed explanation about it.  Without the day tour, we can go into more places that much more interesting for an international tourist like me. Places that day tour didn't show us, and walk slower, take more pictures.  Watch the time, if I'm not mistaken at 12.00 KST, they have a guard changing ceremony (show). Watch it, definitely worth of your time.",319,much
320,215,2161,Very large area to walk around & pretty much the same in each area.. bit hard to condense the tour here I guess but wished we could..,320,much
321,216,2186,"I enjoyed exploring the palace with the English guided tour. Since we were in hanbok, we got to enter the palace for free and it became much more meaningful as we learn more of the history. There were many photo opportunities and it was nice to catch the changing of guards demonstration.",321,much
322,217,2192,The banqueting hall by the lake/large pond was the best feature of this Palace as the cherry trees were in bloom and the willows were well and truly weeping. The site overall is a pleasant spot with some nice reconstructed buildings giving a feel of how life was before the palace was destroyed by the Japanese. The changing of the guard at 10.am and 2pm is well worth timing the visit for and puts the British iof the Guard at Buckingham Palace into perspective. This is so much more colourful.,322,much
323,218,2212,This is a much larger and more colorful attraction than I imagined. I do recommend visiting here in a rented Hanbok because the setting is just so gorgeous for photos and it is not an overcrowded site. However 2 hours is a standard minimum Hanbok Rental time from most shops near the Anguk subway station and it was just barely enough time to walk to place and through grounds. Rent for 4 hours! Entrance the palace is free - just walk through gate. We lucky to catch blooming cherry blossoms as well!,323,much
324,219,2215,"The switching of the guards is cool. The palace is large, lots of walking and little to see. We aren’t allowed to enter the the rooms but can see through the windows. Overall, I don’t care for it much.",324,much
325,220,2223,"Just go. You won’t regret it. Even though it is in Seoul, I don’t feel as though I am in a metropolitan city at all, was like stepping back in time. Gorgeous with so much architecture and history to appreciate. Lots of other awesome things nearby to see and do such as The Blue House (White House equivalent). Dress comfortably, one can easily spend a while exploring. You can rent traditional Korean clothing (Hanbok) to wear when you visit from one of the nearby shops. See if you can catch the changing of the guard ceremony.",325,much
326,221,2277,A historical place must visit for first timer in Seoul. Huge landscape and admiring the buildings that much influenced by Chinese.,326,much
327,222,2299,"The Palace is in fact a complex of buildings and gardens, with space in between. Closed on Tuesdsay! Can be easily explored in a few hours. The buildings are relatively new, much was destroyed in the many wars of Korea, but have been rebuilt in style. The changing of the guards near the entrace gate is a colourful spectacle, a few times of the day. Check for timing. Some of the buildings are in fact large halls, with colourful paintings and some sculptures, that one can look at from the outside, but not enter. Other buildings can be wandered through; those are spare and not very interesting. The museum for Folk Art is part of the complex, with separate admission. When finished with the palace, one can walk (approx. 20 minutes) to the Bukchon Hanok Village, a collection of relatively well preserved (often renovated) traditional houses along narrow lanes. Very tourist oriented and often crowded, but somewhat pleasant to wander through. Many craft shops for buying souvenirs.",327,much
328,223,2306,This place brings so much traditional feels for the millenials. I also recommend wearing hanbok while visiting this place to give you more superb traditional experience,328,much
329,224,2309,This palace is beautiful and there is much more to it if you go to the back and around the property. Look for the small lake and take instagramable pictures.,329,much
330,225,2317,"Since much of Korean culture was destroyed by the Japanese, all the buildings in the palace are replicas of actual buildings. Interesting if you are a history buff but not particularly impressed with the structures themselves.",330,much

332,227,2332,"You will consider the Gyeongbokgung Palace a average asian palace if you've been to Imperial Palace / Forbidden city in China or Angkor Wat in Cambodia. Hence, don't expect too much once you enter the Gyeongbokgung compound. If your main purpose is just to take pictures, you can spend a max of 4 hours roving around the palace. The highlight of our visit in Gyeongbokgung is the changing of guards which is scheduled every 9AM and 2PM.",332,much
333,228,2337,"Had so much fun touring this palace, imagining the drama and intrigues within its walls! You MUST, I repeat, MUST plan to visit first a hanbok rental place nearby and enjoy wearing this traditional costume while visiting the palace. This made the visit especially memorable and fun.  PROS: * Super-fun wearing hanbok (traditional Korean costume) while visiting the palace * Free entrance into the palace, while wearing hanbok. * Lots of opportunity for photos in this historic place, while wearing traditional costume.  CONS: * Chilly in November (40F), but manageable * Hanbok rental costs more than palace admission, but hey, it's fun. * Did not rent the audio tour because my husband said it wouldn't match his costume (hahaha!), but would have added much to the tour.  Rented hanbok for 3-4 hours because hate to rush back, but we only took 2.5 hours because it was chilly and any longer would not have been necessary.",333,much

335,230,2353,The palace was 10 minutes walk from the Four Seasons and we could see it from the hotel itself. We were fortunate enough to catch the first snow of the season overnight so awoke to a blanket of 2-3 inches of settled snow.  The walk to the palace took longer due to the conditions and the visit to the palace made a little more magical by the white out effect. Ordinarily there isn’t too much to see but we dawdled to admire the scene even though it was cold.  Felt a little sorry for the guards in costume - hopefully they were suitably dressed underneath.,335,much
336,231,2387,"Gyeongbokgung continued to serve as the main palace of the Joseon dynasty until the premises were destroyed by fire during the Imjin War (1592–1598) and abandoned for two centuries. However, in the 19th century, all of the palace's 7,700 rooms were later restored under the leadership of Prince Regent Heungseon during the reign of King Gojong. Some 500 buildings were restored on a site of over 40 hectares.The architectural principles of ancient Korea were incorporated into the tradition and appearance of the Joseon royal court.  In the early 20th century, much of the palace was systematically destroyed by Imperial Japan. Since then, the walled palace complex is gradually being restored to its original form. Today, the palace is arguably regarded as being the most beautiful and grandest of all five palaces. It also houses the National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum within the premises of the complex",336,much

338,233,2446,"Visited this palace during the fall season, and you will see the surroundings with yellowish or redish trees.  I only visited 2 palaces in total, but seems this is one of the biggest? Not too sure. It seems that the palace internal design and its layout looks pretty much similar. If you are one who watched quite a few of those Korea’s ancient drama, you will feel that those drama scene came alive in front of you.  There’s a national museum (just right when you came out of the station) which is free admission. Personally, I find it really interesting as you get to know the rich history of Korea in the past.  Further ahead (right besides the museum), there’s a park (at least that’s what I think it is) where you will see a big massive big yellowish tree. Many people who rented the traditional hanbok costume will be taking pictures at there. It was really some nice scene and relaxing.",338,much
339,234,2456,"If you travel to Seoul, a visit to this palace is a must! While we did not hire any handbock (found it a bit of a tourist trap), we did enjoy the walk around the palace and very much loved watching people dressed up with the traditional Korean clothes, and took many pics of people taking pics. I can recommend a visit but be aware that you will find many many people there.",339,much
340,235,2489,"I visited the Palace grounds twice as the first time I did not get a chance to see it all. The second time with a friend, we rented traditional Korean outfits and explored.

The tour schedule was posted in the ticket office. We enjoyed the tour very much & learned about not only a part of Korean history but also current cultural historical connections. I am glad we took the tour. We also watched a change of guard ceremony which I wasn’t too impressed with. Overall it was a nice 1/2 day tour at the palace.",344,much
345,240,2529,The palace is beautiful so well kept and the weather for me was also perfect. there was so much to see and do and the entrance fee was so cheap too! it was just at the change of autumn and the colours were amazing no tree or plant was the same shade! the changing of the guard is fabulous to watch so many people gathered to see it,345,much
346,241,2535,"While interesting to explore, not much areas to take cover for a quick respite from the searing heat of summer. Changing of guard ceremony is a sight to watch, but times and length of ceremony depends on the weather. Ticket is good for one entry only. If you come out to watch the changing of guard ceremony from exploring the palace, you will not be allowed to get in again unless you buy a new ticket, so be careful. Massive structures of palaces and other buildings, all replicas. Still, an experience not to miss when in Seoul.",346,much
347,242,2540,"If you have a choice, do not visit in the summer... it is way to hot. In any case we enjoyed as much as possible and there was a nice museum at the end of the palace which was interesting.",347,much
348,243,2582,I had a great time at the palace. It was pretty much what I expected when I arrived. I loved the contrast between the old architecture and the new buildings in the background. Worth the small fee! And make sure you catch the changing of the guards.,348,much
349,244,2584,"The palace is so much humorous. One the best place to take a picture, you can rent Hanbok dress at the store behind the palace and get free entrance the palace so you don’t have to buy a ticket at front of this place.",349,much
350,245,2585,"In terms of size and magnificence it's the second best of the 4 palaces in my opinion. However, this one gets the most tourist because it's right in the middle of the city with a big statue in front of it. It's the palace of one of the wisest king in Korea who also invented the modern Korean writing script in an attempt to replace the Chinese script.  Inside it's beautiful with many places to walk around and enjoy a nice day in the park. The palaces and buildings, like all other 4 palaces, could be that much better enhanced if they actually placed ancient artifacts/furniture in there instead of a big empty room. Most of them are locked up...",350,much
351,246,2588,Good place to revisit Korean history. Otherwise the place doesn't really have much of other stuff to do. Imperial soldiers will parade the ground every few hours. Great photo-taking opportunity. Otherwise 1 to 2 hours here should be sufficient.,351,much
352,247,2614,We visited all the four palaces & a shrine with the integrated ticket system(for more details check their official website). As far as my personal opinion i didnt enjoy much. My thoughts and expectation where to view the lifestyle of the Korean kings and Queens. In order to experience that we need to see the things they used the same replica of things atleast....but all we saw were just long or small plain halls with not much furnitures or things used by the kings and queens. Most of the halls or rooms were locked and not open for public. This palace was the biggest in area with many halls and grounds. As far as we saw people were just wandering about here and there just like us. May be if we had chosen the guided tour we would have known which place served for which purpose...but then too we dont get to see and imagine ourselves how lives would have been for the Royal family! Its my personal opinion...i dont mean to put down the spirits of visitors who are eager to visit soon or tourists who just get satisfied to set foot into the Royal ground. All 4 palaces were the same.,352,much
353,248,2618,It’s pretty relaxed not much to do but actually see the palace so it’s great for learning about the culture pretty sure there are some guided tours I actually just got a ticket and explored was fun and a little confusing there is a museum on site but they were closed when I was there all in all it’s a good place to get a walk about in and see and feel a little history at the same time also some really good photo spots for scrapbookers,353,much
354,249,2625,"If you rent the traditional costume (hanbok) for the nearby shop (just check with the staff at the entrance), you get to go into the palace for free. If not, entrance fee will have to be paid after the first courtyard.  Palace is really big and you will get an idea of the various functions of the different buildings if you have a local guide with you. If not, just listen in to the various guides who are shouting commentaries.  As for photo opportunities, there are heaps and it just multiplies if you come dressed in their traditional costumes which a lot of the visitors do anyway, so you will not be the odd one out.  There is not much shade beyond the buildings so bring some headdress as it is quite hot from noon onwards. In summer anyway.",354,much
355,250,2632,I would go on a weekend so you can see everyone wearing beautiful traditional clothing. There isn't much to do when you get there but its nice to walk around just take a few hours to yourself.,355,much
356,251,2652,It’s beautiful lovely place so many thing to see and amazing garden and you can see a blue house where is the Korean President live !! Very clean good place to visit and relax !! You can shop and have coffee shop too !! You can walk or take MRT or bus if you stay in the center of city ! I do love Seoul very much will come back next week June 5,356,much
357,252,2663,"To visit a country so proud of its cultural heritage is pleasant. So much time has been taken to not only rebuild a nation so recently devastated by war, but to rebuild a historical journey of a country that has been in the middle of conflict since ancient times. Gyeongbokgung was the primary Palace and stronghold of the King and when you see it you will understand why. The skill to build such a place without the technology of today is breathe taking. Don't just look at the walls and the buildings, take the time to look at how they were constructed and how they fit in with the other palaces, shrines and protective walls that were built to repel invasions. When you sit and take in the sheer expanse of these sites and the amount of people it took to make them run it is mind blowing. To see early ducted underground heating in these ancient sites is stunning. Sit in the gardens, take photos and enjoy everything the site has to offer.",357,much
358,253,2675,"One of the biggest palace in Seoul that we were recommended to visit. However after heading over, we realised there was not much to see. However, it proves as a good spot for photo-taking if in Hanbok as it matches the theme. Luckily for us, it wasn't overly crowded and photo-taking was a breeze. However depending on the locations of the hanbok rental shop, the journey to the palace may take up to 30min!",358,much
359,254,2690,A great spot to take a pics or vlogging! Although i was here when it was winter (its suuuuper cold) but i really like the palace :( i havent explore this place much bcs of the bad weather. But this palace is so great ok recommended,359,much

If you are not a history gig and don't understand much about these places , so it would like all others shrines. Only thing makes it little different is the size. Is really big.",362,much
363,258,2726,"If you want a full on memorable experience here, rental a hanbok before you go. The girls wearing them were so cute that I regretted not getting one. This place is great for photo ops and roaming around the entire place to learn about how they lived centuries ago. It’s huge so you could spend at least 2 hours here. Not recommended on a hot summer day because you’re pretty much out out in the open. This one is larger than the UNESCO palace and better in my opinion. If you’re visiting Seoul, Myeongdong this is highly recommended. It’s walking distance to the cute Bukchon Village where people roam around in their hanboks as well. Great experience, I’d do it again but this time wearing a hanbok.",363,much
364,259,2730,This was the first palace I went to and I'm not sure if I find it that amazing... Probably if I have more time to go around and explore the entire compound. There were many tourists around that was probably why I did not enjoy it that much. It's great for experience purposes if you want to get exposed to Korean culture. There are a lot of things to do outside as well so you need not worry where to eat and stuff. It's also near other famous palaces and Insadong.,364,much
365,260,2746,"Admission ticket is 3000 won, palace closed at 6pm, and last admission is at 5pm. A very huge compound, lotsa walking but nothing much to see except if its sakura else you see many people taking photos, young couples strolling (and more photos taking). Basically this is a paid admission to walk around the big compound. There is of course guards changing performance else I can't convince myself what else to see. The museum across is another different story.",365,much
366,261,2751,"We went on a free Seoul airport tour to see this palace and did not get to see everything. It is a massive place where one should set aside a few hours to explore. We also went in the winter, when it was cold. I imagine in the summer it's a lot better. With that said, I really enjoyed walking and taking pictures of the various buildings. There wasn't too many places to go inside, but one could look into some of the main buildings, such as the throne room of the king.  This is pretty much a ""must see"" if you are going to Seoul and it is located right near the center of the city, so there's no excuse to miss it unless such things bore you.",366,much
367,262,2757,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace was the main royal palace of the Joseon dynasty and was definitely a must-visit on our Seoul bucket list.. Built in 1395, it is located in northern part of Seoul and with that said, it was a rather gobsmacking experience to observe how much Seoul has modernised over the years just by standing at the entrance of the palace. The colours, design and interior of the palace was remarkable and well-preserved over the years.  I visited the place at 1pm, just in time for their change-of-guard ceremony which lasted for about 10 minutes. It was an interesting performance to witness and thank goodness for perfect timing. Expect a lot of tourists dressed up in hanboks (traditional Korean garments) lining up to take a photo with the palace guards or posing everywhere along the palace grounds (and I mean it, EVERY WHERE). I visited the palace on a Tuesday (mind you it was a non-holiday season) and it was packed. I can't imagine what it would be like on a weekend!  There are free tours of the palace grounds in English but I did not follow the crowd as I started getting annoyed at the number of tourists mindlessly carrying their selfie sticks and swinging them around everywhere. It was just me though, I dislike crowded places and flocks of tourists. Worth a visit, nevertheless!",367,much
368,263,2777,This palace reminded me so much of the Forbidden City of Beijing except Gyeongbokgung had way more signs explaining the historical context. It's definitely worth a visit!,368,much
369,264,2786,"I was pretty excited to visit this palace actually. We reached there early in the morning by subway. Once there, people are gathering to watch changing guard ceremony. I thought it's gonna be awesome but it was just average and nothing special about it. We purchased tickets and was asked if I wanted to purchase entrance tickets for all palace. We purchased tickets for Gyeongbokgung Palace only and was glad we did not purchase ticket for all. Nothing much to see inside, not too big or too small. All building are closed. Even if it's open, there's nothing much to see. Nice place to take pictures though. There's a exit gate in the middle of the palace. Exit that way and turn left. You may walk to Bukchon Hanok Village which is just around the corner. 10 minutes walk is required.",369,much
370,265,2790,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the five palaces in Seoul area. This is the main palace of the Joseon Dynasty. Although the palace was restored after suffering damages in 1592 and during the Japanese occupation, the palace was restored beautifully by the Koreans. The palace ground is vast and houses many buildings and halls, all having their own use and purpose.  We made use of the free guided tour in English, provided by the Palace Management Office. The guided tour explains in detail the purpose and history behind each building in the palace. After the guided tour, we had a much better understanding of Korean history.  We also managed to catch the Changing of Palace Guard Ceremony. The ceremony was a reenactment based on historical documents and records.  For seniors(over 65 y/o), admission is free (make sure you bring your passport). Would recommend a visit if you are interested in history and ancient architecture. If we had more time in Seoul, we would like to visit few more of the other four palaces.",370,much
371,266,2800,"Walking distance from our hotel, we visited the palace in the morning where there is not much people yet around. Good for taking photos and nice to see Korean architecture. You have to see the changing of guards that takes place at certain hours of the day. You can also rent traditional Korean attire at a few places around the palace to capture awesome memorable pictures.",371,much
372,267,2810,"The Royal Palace is a must-see attraction if you want to appreciate the life style in the old Korean kingdom. The actual palace is rather large, with a lot of empty spaces. The actual living quarter for the residences are very small. There are simple buildings with several rooms and courtyards. In comparison, I found this Palace more formal than the Japanese. The design is similar the one in Beijing; but in a much much smaller scale.",372,much
373,268,2814,"I've been to this palace twice now, once in winter and the other in June and both times were so much fun. Attend the free tours and take your time walking around the grounds. Rent a hannok too!",373,much
374,269,2815,"While it’s sort of pretty with what there is, the palace grounds are really small and doesn’t really have much grandiosity to it. If compared to the forbidden palace, it pales greatly in comparison. Most (if not all) of the palace is reconstructed from a fire before being abandoned for a few centuries, so it doesn’t look or feel how an ancient structure would typically be. At the end of the palace, beyond it, there are some weird prison like structures that absolutely destroys the beauty of the mountain as a backdrop to the palace. Entry fee isn’t expensive though, at US$3, so it’s worth a visit if you’re exploring the area. Not really worth a detour.",374,much
375,270,2820,"We visited the Gyeongbokgung Palace while we were in South Korea for the Olympics. It allowed us to soak in the long standing history of the country in a very modern and busy downtown city like Seoul. First thing we noticed without much research into the palace was the size and scope of the area. We initially entered the palace thinking it would be a good hour of exploration, but if you want to take in everything the site has to offer that would likely require 4-6 hours. By the time we left, I clocked about 3.5 miles of walking.  The buildings are magnificent. Most are recently built because they have been destroyed so many times over the past 800 years so you won’t be looking at historic monuments per se, but you get the grand scope of the palace as you venture around. We happened to visit right at the end of the four day Korean National holiday so there were a lot of South Koreans taking very traditional pictures with the cultural clothing rented from local shops. We found that extremely interesting and actually allowed us some great pictures of the palace buildings with amazingly garbed locals.  The one thing that I would say is definitely take your pictures, but at a certain point the buildings look very similar and the photographs kind of meld together. Therefore don’t be afraid to put the phone/camera down and just experience the history in front of you. The buildings will look too similar in pictures but you will still be in awe of the surroundings that only your eyes will be able to soak in.  The winter is very cold and the plant life is all in hibernation. I would love to see what the palace looks like in the spring in full bloom but all in all it was a great visit.",375,much
376,271,2833,"You can dress up in hanbok (especially the costumes for king / queen, etc). Lot of photo opp, but not really much to look at. Vast space and not really much inside. It's interesting how international Korea has become.. lots of tourists from all over.",376,much
377,272,2865,"This palace is the biggest among the other 5 palaces in Seoul. It is huge and grand and a great way to spend a relaxing morning. The palace buildings are beautifully restored and its granduer really impressed me. You can easily spend 4 hours just looking at every nook and cranny. Do allocate some time to watch the changing of guards at the main Gwanghwamun gate. Do not rush through this attraction as you sit down at the many seats provided to just watch the relaxing scenery. National Folk Museum of Korea is also situated in the Palace's ground. I was able to enter the museum FOC with the Palace ticket. With such a big ground to cover and a museum to visit, do wear comfortable walking shoes, bring drinking water and your camera. I believe you will enjoy your visit as much as I did.",377,much

There is a scheduled changing of the guards that you should not miss to have a full experience.. It's just like the royal guard changing ceremony in Buckingham Palace - but more colorful with the bright costumes of Korean officials! Very much accessible via train or bus, but get ready to walk and walk to see its beauty. The pavilion there is the one featured in the drama Rooftop Prince which made me more excited to see it. Just 3000yen for the entrance and they have hourly walking tours if you'd like to join. Also, the entrance is free if you're wearing a hanbok! Such a treat to see all the people wearing them while inside a historical place~",386,much

You can even rent traditional palace clothing outside the vicinity. It was negative degrees when I came December this week, so during this season its very advisable to wear appropriately not to get sick. We paid i think 3000 or 4000 won for me and mt friends since they said about something being free of charge but I forgot. They have a mini show in front gate with the guards marching but mostly thats it.. your not allowed to come inside the kings office and other rooms but u can take pics by the outside.

Be sure to check out the elevated pagoda thing by the pond in the middle. The view of the mountains is also very nice when you walk further Northwest. You can't see inside many buildings though so you don't really need to walk through it all. You won't miss much if you don't, save the view.",394,much

The buildings, while for the most part reconstructions, are impressive, especially the throne room, even if most a reconstructions following the destruction of the originals by the Japanese when they annexed Korea. There are a lot of locals in traditional costume too - easy to hire nearby and gets them in for free as well as making for more picturesque photos.  It is stupidly cheap to get into: a couple of dollars/pounds/euros equivalent.  Do take one of the free guided tours in English (10am and 2pm but check). Without one of these, or a Korean speaker, you will be pretty-much in the dark as to the function of buildings and underlying stories. The only building open to view is the impressive throne room and the only one that you can get inside is a small memorial to a queen who was murdered by a Japanese hit-squad for opposing their takeover.  I would time a visit to take in the changing of the guard: OK, they are actors but it is well-worth the twenty minutes (and you can get into the front court to see it without paying).",398,much

On this trip with some friends, we decided we would get a good position to see the entire ceremony and visit the palace as well (a bonus was a visit to the National Palace Museum nearby). Since China curtailed visits by its citizens over the installation of anti-missile systems in South Korea, the crowd was much smaller and we were afforded excellent views of the ceremony. The palace too was likewise not very crowded and gave us lots of time to wander about and admire the architecture and the displays. Free admission to both events was a bonus. And there were lots of people in hanboks, or traditional Korean dress, A while back, a rule was introduced that people wearing hanboks (Korean or otherwise), did not have to pay for entry into the various palaces that charged entry. It was quite amusing to see Caucasians, South Asians, and pretty much everything in between in hanbok.

Photos don't capture just how grand it really is to stand under these amazing buildings. Enjoyed the changing of the guard ceremony. Since this was part of a larger tour we only had about an hour to see the front area and chamber. As I understand it there was much more to see that we just didn't have time for. ideal plan to spend 2-3 (maybe more depending on your stamina and interest level). Enjoy a beautiful picnic. There was a fee to enter but since it was included in the tour price I am not sure how much it was. Enjoy!,402,much

All buildings rebuilt and repainted in the 1800-1900s since pretty much burnt down by the Japanese in the 1600s. You see the same Josean period architecture everywhere in Korea (Buddhist temples etc) since most things older seem to have been destroyed centuries ago. Lots of girls and young women in hired Hanok costumes as this gives free entrance but adds to the atmosphere for all. Allow a couple of hours.",404,much

It is the biggest of the palaces in Seoul and has been much restored after having destroyed by fire, neglected or damaged by others during the 600 years since the oldest parts were built.  The buildings are set within lovely grounds and flower beds. There are two pavilions set within ponds which are particularly scenic.  Only downside is the small print in the information leaflet!

419,314,3259,"There aren't many places in Asia where a city would sacrifice so much land in the middle of the central district to history. Seoul is a city where technology is perhaps is currently at the forefront of the world and yet they respect their rich history and display this to visitors from all over the globe. Make sure you work your time table around to see the change of guard (every two hours I think). Gwanghwamun, Heungnyemun and Gyeongbokgung are all located in the same area. One ticket will allow access to both Palaces. For those keen you can also change into Hanbok to walk around the area.  Recommend checking the weather before heading there lot of open areas to walk through avoid rainy days if possible.",419,much

422,317,3279,"A smaller version of Beijing's forbidden city. Not so old in reality given it seems to have been ravaged by Japanese occupation at least twice but the city is trying to restore to its former glory. So much history there but not much by way of signage to indicate the role and purpose of many of the buildings, how life was lived in the palaces and grounds. Very few photos of what it looked in its heyday before the modern city of Seoul swamped its grandure.",422,much
423,318,3289,"The place is vast but nothing impressive/memorable. The palace looks newly built rather than a historical site.Lots of vast , sandy open areas. The gardens are very boring and ameteurish. Didn't find it interesting or memorable. Seen much more impressive historical sites in Asia than this. Japan has much better and more impressive historical site. If you don't have much time in Seoul, can skip this.",423,much
424,319,3300,"We spent a total of about 2 hrs walking around here. The taxi driver dropped us off at the side entrance by the culture museum so that's where we started.  The whole palace here is not very big, so doesn't take very long to walk through. Since we came through the side, we weren't able to join a free tour either. So unfortunately there was not much explanation minus what was mentioned briefly on the map. I do wish they had signs or something up in each area so you're not just staring and walking blindly.  There is a lot of construction going on right now so you'll see a lot of white fences up, which unfortunately blocked visiting any of the over water structures. That was a bit disappointing but understandable.  If the timing works, I do recommend catching the catching of the guards performance. They don't need real guard any more these days so it's more of a show than the real stuff like at Buckingham, but was still fun to watch for 15 min. Then you can go take pictures with them.  Given a lot of similar structures and building styles, I can't stop comparing this to the Forbidden City. Gyeongbokgung is just not as large or grand and therefore did not seem as impressive to me. But still worthy of a visit.",424,much
425,320,3313,I was there with friend after our work it's amazing and beautiful.we very much enjoy wearing costumes hanbox a traditional Korea Stye where u can find rent from outside palace cost approx 15000-20000 won its so nice to get this experience and you don't have to pay for entrance fee if you are in the costume. There is parade for guards exchanges which is very interesting too. We spend almost half day there it really a wonderful time☺️,425,much
426,321,3342,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is much more like a series of palaces within a palace. The majesty you feel when you walk in builds as you walk through its various inner palaces - as does the sense of wonder of how yet another suite of royal accommodations could be so impressively sited seemingly in total privacy despite being in a huge complex. And if you walk around the outer wall before entering you'll come across first a series of Mom&Pop hawker joints to eat in (recommended, they are full of personality and very honest, local food) and then some trendier renovated lanes full of boutiques and the like. Do make the effort to fully explore not just the palace, but everything there is around it.",426,much

428,323,3351,It's a awesome and magistic place. You can walk around and explore this gigantic place by your self. Guide's are also good but according to me no need for that. Many things are in English and you don't need to know much if you only want to see the palace....how the kings and queens lived. It's a big place....i listened to music and walked around!. After I visited the palace museum that is free and nice to see. I also visited the teahouse inside the palace and drank one of the kings favourite tea against illness 😊 it was a nice experience! If you like culture....then you must visit this place...u won't regret it! 👍,428,much

I don't remember if there was much signage so you may need a guide to interpret what you are seeing.

There were not a lot of inside things to see, just peering through a door.",429,much

The rehearsal went on for over 2 hours starting around 11 am on Sunday. They worked on tiny parts of the ceremony over and over, yet missed glaring errors. However, it was very interesting to watch this changing ceremony, hear the very unique music. Costumes were incredibly elaborate. Don't know if this is a normal rehearsal done frequently, or only occasionally. It was not the normal changing of the guard After the heat became too intense, we went into the Museum It was free but there is not much there. They don't seem to have much historical memorabilia but they do have 2 very cool vintage autos in the atrium which seem like the center for all attractions. Only spent about 1 hr in the museum and that was more than enough time to cool off and sit for awhile.",432,much
433,328,3425,"Was there to visit the palace in Apr 2017. Location is central u can take a subway to the station named after it and a short walk will take u to main gate. It happened to be I think royal culture week so many Koreans dressed in traditional hangbok so it was quite a sight. Entrance fee is not expensive only around 1500 won I think. I rented a audio guide in English but on hindsight I would suggest to take the free English guided tour at specific intervals daily. As the audio guide was cumbersome to use and info was a bit of overkill. But it gives some background on the palace which was central piece of Korean culture. The place was definitely much smaller than Beijing forbidden city which I feel is a much better tourist experience. Probably because most of buildings were burnt down during jap occupation and the rebuilt ones had spartan deco within. And there wasn't much exhibition on ancient palace exhibits unlike the forbidden city. Hence my average rating. But if u haven't been to china, I guess it's still a good way to spend 2-3 hours of your time understanding the Korean history and the royal family.",433,much
434,329,3443,"This is one of the big attractions in Seoul, but I felt there is so much to do in the city and this just isn't a top memory. The palace and the grounds are basically a reconstruction because of various wars. I know it's not their fault, but it makes it less interesting to me. It is pretty, but many of the buildings just feel like the same thing over and over. You're probably going to see it, but with such a wonderful city, I would recommend seeing more of modern Seoul.",434,much
435,330,3444,We were welcomed by a teen guide working on her English skills. She was amazing and knew lots of details about the history of the palace. She explained that she did the tours once a month for school credit. The changing of the guard is a colourful must see. The only disappointment was that all you get to see are empty buildings. There are a few sticks of furniture - such as a replica throne and bed frame but not much else.,435,much

The palace buildings are mostly reconstructions, because lots of the buildings were destroyed during the Japanese occupation. The Koreans took great care in reconstructing the building as faithfully as possible.  The site is very big, so you'll at least need two hours to see everything. When in a hurry make sure not to miss Gyeonghoeru, a beautiful construction sitting on top of 48 stone pillars. reflected in the surrounding artificial lake.

If you been to the Imperial palace in other Asian cities (Beijing, Tokyo, Taipei) you will not find this site particularly impressive.

We like the luxury of Four Seasons hotels but like the location of the Seoul Four Seasons as it was central to the locations I wanted to visit. My contacts with the staff started long before we arrived. I email the Concierge in relation to the locations I wanted to visit and how to best coordinate my travels. In a few emails we had complete a plan which included all sites within our limited time. The Concierge team is excellent. They continued to guide us after we arrived. When we checked in we soon learn this excellence extended though the entire staff from the escort to our room, dining staff, everyone. We felt very much at home and comfortable. We had a premiere room with a great view of modern Seoul. The room was very spacious, clean, modern and well equipped for any traveler. The first evening we ate a late dinner at the hotel. Great service and great food, a sampling of Korean dished. Each morning we ate at the breakfast buffet. We managed to eat light but walking and viewing all the culinary offerings is a tour in its self. An excellent exhibit of historic Korean royal architecture. Visit in the mornings around 10:00 am entering at the South Gate to catch the changing of the royal guards. Note the building techniques, colors and layout to the palace buildings. At extensive as these palace grounds are the represent only about 14% of the original structures. Make it a point to exit through the North Gate.

485,380,3978,"During our time in South Korea, being the history buffs we are, we purchased the Integrated Pass for Palaces, which basically gave us tickets and access for all five major palaces for 10,000 won, as compared to 14,000 won if purchased individually instead. From our visits, we could safely say that out of the five, Gyeongbokgung Palace seemed to be the most well known, and perhaps unfortunately, the most crowded too.  We happened to visit during the Golden Week holiday period in China, and that meant hordes of Chinese tourists swarming the Geunjeongjeon, or Throne Hall. It would have been a little more ideal if I had been able to secure a slot for the night tour, where the crowd is much lesser and it is more beautiful for night photography. Luckily, it seems that most tour groups bring their tourists to the Geunjeongjeon area only. Beyond that, if you are willing to walk more and more further, you will be rewarded with less crowds.  The architectural style of the palace is somewhat closer to the Ming Dynasty style, such as the Forbidden Palace for example. This is in contrast to the other palaces such as Changdeokgung Palace, which has a more traditional Korean style. It might look similar at first glance, but on closer inspection, some differences can be seen. The Gyeongbokgung Palace that is seen standing today is actually a reconstruction and restoration, as the original one was sadly demolished during the Japanese colonial era in 1915. Still, the amount and scale that has been restored so far is astonishing and must be seen first hand to understand the very soul of Korea better.  The National Folk Museum of Korea happens to be inside Gyeongbokgung Palace and it can provide a respite from the heat with the building itself being air-conditioned. The exterior of the museum is quite beautiful and is worthy of some great shots. There is also the Hyangwonjeong Pavilion that is worth walking far enough for a great shot.  You should not miss the royal guard changing ceremonies done by reenactors that take place at Gwanghwamun, the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace at 10 am and 2 pm. The ceremony takes about 20 minutes and it is an experience you should not miss. You can even take photos with the royal guards after the ceremony too!  Do take note that Gyeongbokgung Palace is closed on Tuesdays and sometimes it may close if it gets too crowded, so do plan accordingly. A night tour would be even better if you are able to get a slot. This is an excellent place to see both the locals and tourists in Hanbok, the Korean national costume, since those in Hanbok get in for free. If you want less crowds however, I would strongly suggest Changdeokgung Palace instead if you only have time for one palace to visit.",485,much
486,381,4008,There are site with nice views but didn't offer much to see since most rooms are barred from entrance. Only peeking from windows are allowed. But quite a place to visit anyway. Love the lakes though.,486,much
487,382,4029,"OH MY GOD! This is a huge area with lots of palaces all connected to each other that makes the whole place feel like a maze! The biuldings are beautiful and the architecture is superb. The decorations are really nice! Just one problem though, there wasn't enouh info about the places in this palace. We didn't want to walk with a tour and wanted to look around on our own pace so we didb't get much info. There's a good resting place with food and drinks and souvenir shop at the entrance. you can get a hanbok and wear it while you go around.",487,much
488,383,4042,"The first of Seoul's palaces we visited, and by far the most impressive. Incredible architecture & fantastic English guide, who explained so much in so little time. The changing of the guards ceremony was also worth staying to see. Really worth visiting.",488,much
489,384,4050,"Nice photos to take, but if without a guide its boring, however i guess you can read about it beforehand so that you can enjoy more. Takes around 1 hour to 2 hours depending on how much photos you take :)  There is an option of a combo ticket for 4 palaces and a temple, but although i bought it i do not recommend you do it unless you really enjoy this repetetive rooms and buildings :)  May be just one palace and one temple would be ebough, so no need to pay for the combo ticket  Try not to miss the guard changing ceremony and take photos witg the guards. So do go early (not after 1:30 pm) to be able to attend one of them (held each 15 minutes i guess)",489,much
490,385,4061,The guards at the entrance very interesting. There is not much things to see inside. It was not crowded and probably you need 15 minutes to view the whole palace.,490,much
491,386,4097,"I've visited three palaces in Seoul and this is my most favorite. It's a big place with many beautiful sites so be prepare to walk. We took our three teenage girls and found so many places to take pictures.  Recently, my girls traveled to Korean and decided to go here at night or at dusk. They ended up taking great shots and it was much cooler in July. Summers are a challenge to go sightseeing in Korea because of the heat and humidity. Visit in the fall or spring if you can.",491,much
492,387,4102,"Absolutely beautiful wandering the grounds, watching the changing of the guard. We happened to be there on the hottest day of the year which meant we did not wander as far and as much as we wanted. Be sure to see the Folk Museum there.",492,much
493,388,4119,"This place is huge and there is so much going on. Although I didn't get to see it because there was a bad rain storm and it was still raining a little, I still enjoyed walking around this huge place.",493,much
494,389,4123,"It was such a hot month that watching the changing of guards (they have my sympathy) and walking around the huge palace grounds sapped all our energy - even with an umbrella. We perspired so profusely that we decided not to visit every part of the palace. It would definitely be much nicer to visit during the cooler months although not too cold. Having said so much, I would still recommend this place highly for a visit.",494,much
495,390,4130,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is definitely worth a trip if you are prepared! It is quite large and gets very hot in the summer months. Comfortable shoes, water bottles, and sun hats are a must. We were lucky enough to catch the changing of the guard, which included a small parade of fresh guards and drummer. We had to buy a ticket to go up and into the upper section of the palace entrance, to be honest, there was not much English around to explain things. Definitely read up on the history of the Palace, maps are available on site. The farther you go into the Palace the more beautiful and lush the surroundings become. We also ventured into the Korean Folk museum on the property, a welcome retreat from the heat and chance to grab a cold drink. At the very end of the property, just outside and behind the palace, The Blue House is located. It is the executive office and official residence of the South Korean head of state, the President of the Republic of Korea. Outside the palace back gate is a wonderful photo opportunity if you have interest in The Blue House. We took the path down between the Palace and The Blue House and came to large intersection which had a beautiful fountain and free museum across the street.",495,much
496,391,4141,"Not much signage so, I would recommend taking a tour. Be sure not to go in the heat of the day. There is little shade and the summer heat was brutal.",496,much
497,392,4157,"It's a lovely palace and very expansive. For photographers, it is an excellent venue both day and night. I can't remember how much the ticket was, but probably around $2 usd.",497,much
498,393,4185,"This formed part of a private tour we'd organised, so we didn't need to buy tickets or think on timings... we simply were guided, informed and enjoyed.  The changing of the Royal guard was stunning and brilliantly translated over tannoy :-)  Our guide explained many many interesting facts about the architecture, history, residents and traditions relating to both the palace, residencies and grounds.  In the grounds is also the National Folk Museum... Well worth visiting with its excellent exhibitions and Korean history timeline board... please stop to read it, rather than just walk past, or you'll miss out on knowing so much!!  There is also a children's museum, so all ages catered for.",498,much
499,394,4194,The grandest of palaces in Seoul. I arrived when they were doing a traditional guard ceremony demonstration which was great to watch. Not much to see there but nice to wander around the buildings.,499,much
500,395,4203,"I went with a group of people in a bus, Tour guide was Korean lady fluent in English. After arriving there was too much walk and talk, we were not allowed to enter some places so we only sneak peek from outside",500,much
501,396,4210,I have visited the Palace a few times with my South Korean students. There is so much history there! It is amazing and all South Koreans know a lot about it.,501,much
502,397,4217,"This was the first Korean palace we visited - it is a 5-minute walk from the Gwanghwamun subway stop. The admission fee is minimal ($3.00 I believe), which is appropriate. It was hot as blazes - be sure to dress for heat and bring an umbrella - not for rain - but for shade! You can look in to the palace, but visitors are not allowed inside - you have to peer-in. The palaces are interesting, though after you see one or two, they begin to look very much the same. I would recommend choosing two to visit and then move on to something else.",502,much
503,398,4229,This is a great attraction and you can get a free guide that will make the tour much more enjoyable.,503,much
504,399,4231,"I went there with my family and we only walked into the front yard. We did not enter to the palace because we think there isn't much to see and they are not as nice as the Summer Palace in Beijing. However, if you are interested in these kind of places, you got to visit this Palace.",504,much
505,400,4265,"It is really amazing place. Very cheap too (only 3.000 won and you get a free tour of 1:30h). The place is huge so wear confortable clothes and shoes. If you are coming in a sunny day do not forget to wear sunscreen and caps because except for the gardens, there are not much shadow or trees to hide from the sun. You will probably spend more than 2 hours walking. You can also rent an audio tour if you do not want to wait for the next free tour. Beautiful buildings and story of Joseun Dinasty.",505,much
506,401,4284,"This tour is absolutely nice !!! We loved everything, especially the greated tour options. Thanks for all of your good suggestions. I also appreciate your guiding me as I really appreciate Seoul and Korean culture so much now! Thank you for everything.",506,much
507,402,4293,One of the important places in Seoul must be visited .. too much big and too much beautiful .. you feel there you are one of the old Korean people .. full of history .. I like it and want to visit again,507,much
508,403,4300,Make sure to get a tour guide to take you through this amazing Palace. You get so much more out of exploring this sprawling complex with someone giving you context. The changing of the guard is colorful and filled with drums and music. Very cool.,508,much
509,404,4327,Not much to say since we didnt go into the Details. Nice place to take some photos. Everything was clean and the place itself was worth seing.,509,much
510,405,4332,"We liked it quite much. Beautiful place, worth the visit. It closes at 5pm we were there at 4pm, still enough time to wander around :)",510,much
511,406,4404,"Historical place and it is spectacular. Free tour guide provided and there is performance in the middle of palace. The palace is connected to the front area of Cheong Wa Dae. Love the view so much. There is a museum with the coffee counter, you may get a rest here with free wifi. It is worth to spend 2-3 hours here and then go to eat ginseng chicken soup after this.",511,much
512,407,4409,It was pretty much a muchnes although changing of the guard really good. Inside was sparse and for me just ok. The museum however far more interesting as it depicted life to the present,512,much
513,408,4413,The Gyeongbokgung Palace is an interesting place to visit especially if you are interested in Korean history and the way of life of royalty during that era. I cannot say that I could identify with much of what I saw as it was not an area of the world that I know very much about and so did not appreciate a lot of what I was seeing and was being told about.,513,much
514,409,4436,"We did this free transit tour by the city of Seoul and while the place itself is amazing, there is nothing much to see especially if you have no background on korean history like i did.",514,much
515,410,4444,"When we visited we saw the change of the guard at the main gates. I'm not sure how frequently this occurs but it's worth checking out to see if you cancoincide your visit. The uniforms of the guards are colourful and flamboyant and you can take photos with them much the same way as you can with the guards in London. There was also a lot of young Koreans visiting in traditional dress when we were there. The grounds, lake and palace are nice - you need to set aside a couple of hours",515,much
516,411,4450,"Enjoyable tour of the palace given, free of charge, by students of the local language college wanting to improve their English. If asked do say yes to this service. It really is free and you'll get much more out of your visit. Lovely kids.",516,much
517,412,4459,"Beautifully restored after a tumultuous history that left large parts destroyed, the palace is a monument to the resilience of Koreans and the importance of their history. More understated and elegant than the Forbidden City, the palace can be enjoyed as a stroll in an hour or as a full half days' exploration activity. For future visitors: there is not much shade (particularly in the central parade ground area where the changing of the guard may be viewed) and it can be very hot in the summer months.",517,much
518,413,4473,"The palace is simply mesmerizing. Whenever you step in, you'll automatically grab your camera to capture the beauty.  Tip: 1) be there on 10 am to watch the guardian-changing ceremony. 2) take a photo with hanbok-wearing local. 3) don't waste too much time here, there are other palaces around.",518,much
519,414,4482,"Nice for a wander around on a nice sunny day. Not at all expensive for how much of the palace and the grounds you get to walk around. Can easily spend a few hours walking around the palace and the gardens. Definitely worth a visit, an absolute gem in amongst the high rise buildings of central Seoul",519,much
520,415,4498,It is much smaller than Beijing's Palace but similar set-up. Many Korean came here with traditional costumes on that day and friendly enough to take photo with us. Thank you!,520,much
521,416,4502,"Was lucky enough to see the changing of the guards ceremony, very colorful! This place is Amazing, so much to see. Make sure you read all of the information plaques. Very highly recommend",521,much
522,417,4507,This is my 2nd visit but its much different as compared to winter period. Do not miss the change of guards and be all out and rent a hanbok for great photo around the palace. Of course take a tour if you are interested in the history as this is the grandest palaces in Seoul.,522,much
523,418,4520,"We visited during peak festival time as a family of three, with a 2 year old in a stroller. Overall, this is a great place to visit. We would have enjoyed it more if it hadn't been so busy, but obviously as we visited during a festival it was to be expected. Good: Huge. Seriously. You could probably spend two full days here if you saw every inch of this place. Very interesting. Lots of signs in English. They also have audio tours available in English (and other languages) if you like that sort of thing. Lots of other things are connected to this, including a children's museum. If you like museums, you could spend several days going through all the ones surrounding this Palace.  Bad: Since this hasn't been much restored, the ground is very uneven. It is very difficult to push a stroller or wheelchair over it. The staff do their best to help by putting ramps over doorways, up stairways, etc, but it is still difficult. Not necessarily bad, but be careful about going here on a windy day. The sand/dirt on the ground is very loose and will blow into eyes and noses.  Definitely a must-see if you enjoy/are interested in Korean history.",523,much
524,419,4524,"Enjoyed seeing the palace complex, I was glad I was with an organized tour group since I learned a lot of history that made it much more interesting",524,much
525,420,4537,"Loved seeing this beautiful place nestled in the heart of such a cosmopolitain city. The architecture was breathtaking, with so much to see for a really affordable entrance fee. There were so many hidden areas to take photos without tourists all over. Had a great time.",525,much
526,421,4576,"This palace is huge and would probably take a good part of the day to explore. I personally did not venture into the palace quarters (seems like you had a pay an entry fee?) but remained outside taking photographs. Some lovely views guaranteed, what with the mountains some distance from the palace in the North. I actually much preferred Changdeok and Deoksu Palaces though. I found the change of guard procession here to be a tad bit disappointing. Also, tourists come here by the bus load and the crowd was overwhelming at just 10:30am in the morning. Needless to say, I left really quickly.",526,much
527,422,4582,We visited the palace meanwhile a few times and can recommend you to put this on your list too. There are guided tours available in foreign languages. We did a few in English when friends came over and there's quite a difference in quality among the different guides. My wife followed once the Chinese guided tour which was apparently best of all. The chinese speaking guide carried apparently so much more knowledge of the history than the English speaking guides we followed so far. The season I liked most is autumn. The different colors around the lake and the ginko tree area are magnificent.,527,much
528,423,4604,"The complex is nice and some buildings spectacular. The whole place impress because of its overall size. This being said, there is not much to learn or even to do besides walking outside, along the empty or closed palaces. Certainly worth a visit though",528,much
529,424,4631,"There isn't much too see, but if you're on a date, you don't want the experience to just drag on and on. So in that sense, the palace is perfect. Many people prefer to go to Gangnam for dates, but I think Gyeongbokgung and Gwanghwamun area are much better as it is cleaner and more things to do.  Night-hours at the palace is also a sight to see, however, be warned of big crowd.",529,much
530,425,4638,"Most of the palaces have been burnt down several times (being made of wood), so they are mostly replicas, and not very authentic when there is a concrete lintel across the roof...it wouldn't have taken much to hide the lintel under authentic roofing tiles. Also, you can't go inside most of the buildings due to their small size and fragility - 'wallpapered' floors wouldn't take too many feet pounding across them - so it's not like visiting a stately home in the UK!",530,much
531,426,4654,"This is one of those places that you need to visit because it is one of Seoul's tourist attractions... It looks like a much smaller and less ornate version of the Forbidden Palace in China. If you visit here and want to go to the Bukchon Hanok Hillage, be sure to ask for directions as they are in close proximity... Since you are here, the National Folk Museum was also pretty good to see. That attraction was free...",531,much
532,427,4682,Great to spend 4 hours learning a bit more about korean culture and history. I found this really interesting. We joined the free walking tour which was probably the best decision as the guide was able to explain the difference between the buildings and piint out clever little things like the symbolic meaning of the number of animals on the roof beams and the innovative way the korean royalty kept their rooms warm in winter.  The palace is large enough that you wont feel crowded much. Bring some snacks or purchase outside so you have a drink while you wander around.,532,much
533,428,4689,"I visited the palace with my partner and got bored too soon. There is not much to do inside the palace. Only a very few spots where you can get yourself clicked. I would not really recommend this site if you are seeking for some fun place and picnic spot to visit. But, if you want to tick one more destination on your checklist then go ahead and have a look at it. You might like it. Oh, and by the way there is a museum also which you can visit. But again, it was a disappointment too. Good luck!!! :) :)",533,much
534,429,4721,This palace is like stepping back in time. You learn so much about Korean history and the architecture of this palace is gorgeous.,534,much
535,430,4722,Grand spot. Nice visiting. However the palaces are all similar and less nice than the Chinese ones.  Basically yes you have to go and see but don't expect much.  It is quite surprising to see the mix of modernity in a so small space.,535,much
536,431,4738,"This palace from the Joseon Dynasty was awesome! The price of the ticket was reasonable ($10 US) and it also including the Korean folk museum, which was by far the best museum I went to in Korea! We waited for the English speaking tour at the front. I would highly recommend the free guided tour!! I wouldn't have enjoyed this place as much as I did without the tour guide. She gave some really good insight and background history that was compelling as you walking around the grounds and visited the different areas of the palace grounds. The guided tour is about an hour or so. We also visited the museum which was included in the price. Go there as well. It was awesome!! It has some spectacular displays with life size depictions of Korean traditional ways of life and past history. It also had a Korean food history area as well which was fascinating too. Overall, I am very happy we went to Gyeongbokgung Palace! A highlight of our trip.",536,much
537,432,4745,"Its a must visit, cos its very much part of Korean history. Location is perfect, near US embassy and busy intersection. Free English tour and you can sit in the park and relax if you must. My son who was an exchange student there took me around, so I knew not to expect much out of this 'palace'. Click a picture with the guards outside if you like and the big statues of the King on the pavilion outside",537,much
538,433,4764,"Maybe it was the fact that this was a somewhat spontaneous visit without detailed planning and we happened to hit it at the perfect time that the changing of the guard was starting, which was exactly when we arrived. Maybe it was that the weather was bright, sunny and perfect. I think it was more than that. This place felt magical. There was a peaceful presence that can't be explained but we both very much enjoyed it. I found the free English speaking tour also enjoyable and informative helping to bring me up to speed on the Joseon Dynasty. If I had one complaint, it was that the English speaking tour guide had a quiet voice and the sound system didn't help her much. The site is beautiful and historic and not to be missed in Seoul.",538,much
539,434,4766,"This palace basically composes of many temples, pagodas and more standing on sand. It just looks like an abandoned desert. They don't let you go into the palaces, so there's not much to see from the outside. The similar characteristics of different palaces and the lack of background information makes it a tourist site that is not recommended. Remember to follow a guided tour to have a better understanding of the functions of different structures. Or else you will find your visit boring and meaningless.",539,much
540,435,4789,"The area is big. But most of the building is closed. So much to see, only outside of the building. The only building we could see inside is the Throne, but the dragon on the ceiling is nice. There is a museum inside which has a nice display.",540,much
541,436,4793,"Our family really enjoyed the visit to the palace. Glad we joined the free volunteer guided tour which helped us learnt more about the palace, than just touring the surrounding. The palace is really huge, from outer court, to inner court, to every little corner of the palace, it tells us so much about how the royal family lived in the olden days. The tour guide was very patient and explained in great details of how the emperors lived, how the palace was managed, and how the princes/ princesses were brought up outside palace. We learnt a lot through this visit, and fell in love with Korean culture even more :) A must visit place, for someone who loves history - like me :)",541,much
542,437,4797,Definitely a must go to if you are a traveler visiting Seoul. Not too much to do though- you just walk around and look at the buildings and cant go inside them.,542,much
543,438,4805,"I went on the Seoul Historic Tour through Koridoor tours on the weekend. I was going to like traditional Korean places, so it was so much fun.  First, I went to the Jogyesa Buddhist temple, and I could understand of Korean Buddhism. There were also a bunch of great flower-decorations It was nice to see the temple in South Korea, and then we went to gyeong bok palace. Tour guide was explaining to us about Korea Choseon dynasty which was so impressed.  We went to national folklore museum and then we went to the blue house and sa-rang chae.  It was exciting to see all the presidents from the very first and currently one.  I would love to go there again, when my friends visit to Korea next time.  Thanks Koridoor Tours!!!!",543,much
544,439,4830,You much visit all palaces in Seoul. Palaces are must watch. The structure and the piece of art is something that you will admire. It is very peaceful place.,544,much
545,440,4833,"Even in the freezing winter days, this palace is still a worty place to visit. Quite a big ground to cover, its interesting to see inside the museum and when you re lucky enough they will open some of the palace doors to let you see whats inside. Its not much, but still interesting.",545,much
546,441,4861,"Nice day out to walk around the palace grounds. I find the explanation a bit lacking. If you did not have a guide, you would not be able to appreciate as much of the history",546,much
547,442,4893,"It's Seoul's Northern Palace and subsequently also the largest palace in Seoul. There isn't much to say about the Palace other than that you need to go if you're traveling in Seoul. The grounds are huge and the buildings are beautiful. Yes, there are quite a lot of people, but that is to be expected. If you really really dislike crowds, I would suggest the Changgyeonggung Palace (just east of Gyeongbokgung) however this palace is not nearly as impressive.",547,much
548,443,4915,"The palace grounds are huge. Don't try and do this on your own. You need a guide to explain the layout and importance of the architecture and history.  Be warned - the steps can be high and tricky. Wear comfortable shoes and take it at your own pace. Visit the Korean Folk museum to get an overview of life. Also, there's another museum by the main gate that features some of the royal cars.  The changing of the guard is impressive. Don't expect the huge pageantry of Buckingham Palace. This is a much smaller ceremony worth viewing.  If you walk all the way to far back corner, beyond the lagoons, you get a great view of the current Presidential House. Be sure to keep your ticket with you.",548,much
549,444,4926,"We had previously visited the Changdeokgung Palace and felt that this palace was pretty much the same only larger with far more tourists. My conclusion is if you have time for only one palace, go see Changdeokgung instead. It's only about a kilometer or so up the street. Anyway - we did enjoy the visit here and found some spots not completely mobbed by tourists. There were lots of teens in hanbok which leant an old world authenticity to the site.",549,much
550,445,4927,"Conveniently accessed by public transportation and close to a bunch of other attractions like Bukchon Village and Cheonggyecheon Stream, I would suggest to head out early to Bukchon Village, enter Gyeongbokgung Palace and head out to Cheonggyecheon Stream for the evening. The palace is beautiful but can be very full at times, but try to see as much of the buildings as possible, especially the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion and don't forget to see the re-enactments of Korean royal guards in the court yard.",550,much
551,446,4928,"This place were huge. Nothing much to see or do here. Empty buildings, dull ground. There are beautiful lake and small cafe. i went here in spring season . Weather kinda hot. This area will be hotter in summer because the surrounding are plain desert.",551,much
552,447,4933,South Korea is very much famous of its heritage such that it will always be a good idea when visiting to this country to go to the palaces. Gyeongbokgung Palace is one of the famous palaces in South Korea. The place is big and you can explore. It is good to go there in the morning. There is an entrance fee of 3000 KRW.,552,much
553,448,4953,"It very much reminded me of the Forbidden Palace setup in Beijing, but felt much more extensive. The fall colors on the trees were fabulous. It seems to be more beautifully landscaped in Seoul. It was big enough to feel you could get lost. We did not do a tour, but many people were and you would learn a lot more by taking a tour.",553,much
554,449,4959,"As much as I've enjoyed the forbidden city in Beijing, I had a good time exploring Gyeongbokgung Palace with my camera. historical architecture and beautiful garden walk which I often seen in Korean period drama! It was very very crowded when I was there.",554,much
555,450,4963,"I went here on a Thursday which I think was good because it was not that many people there as I would expect it to be on a weekend. Very easy to get there by metro and the entrance is only 3000 won, a little less than 3USD. The park is really nice especially in autumn with a lot of different colors and a lot of space. Defiantly worth a visit. There is also a museum of Korean people and history connected to the palace where you get free entrance if you went to the palace. It was also good for those that doesn't know that much about the development of Korea and its people.",555,much
556,451,4965,We didn't get to see much of the gyeongbok palace because our tour was in a rush. But they had an interesting architecture & heating system which was explained by our local guide.,556,much
557,452,4987,"Enjoyed it, not as much as the secret garden and other palaces or the shrine, but definitely the largest and most visited temple. Skipped the tour and walked around on my own. Not much to see except the very spartan buildings, all the area around has been cleared sort of, very little vegetation.",557,much
558,453,4991,Gyeongbokgung palace was an absolutely stunning place to visit. We went on the last day of Chuseok so it was very busy with school groups and visitors for a festival.  It's very large but there's lots to see with several old buildings open to view and walk around. There isn't too much to say other than it was a truely breath taking place.,558,much
559,454,4998,"Took the train to the stop just in front of the palace also named after the palace. Try to get there by 10 am as teher is a changing of guards parade which is quite fun to watch. you can also take pics with the traditionally garbed guards at the South main gate. Much like the Beefeaters, they cannot talk and will not move. make sure to line up and be orderly!  the palace was well preserved and there is much space to walk about and roam despite the tourist hordes that were everywhere. We went in all the way till we arrived at the back garden sanctuary which feature ponds, trees and small hillocks. this was a gem of a garden in the heart of Seoul and a great place to just sit down on the grass and imbue the tranquillity of the place. The looming hills just beyond the walls were a magnificent backdrop as is the pond to the east where there was a picturesque pagoda on the island in the centre. Many shutterbugs were capturing the beauty of the place. Do take the exit where the National Folk Museum is ..take the EAST gate and from there you can take a leisurely stroll past arty shops to Insadong where u can have a wonderful lunch in one of the traditional eating houses in the side lanes!",559,much
560,455,5004,Can easily be done in an hour. Only $3USD. Good photo opportunities. Not much history or displays or artifacts. The buildings look the same after you see a few but definitely Wow for a while.,560,much
561,456,5021,"We went during Mid October 2015. Ticket prices 3000 Won per adult which at the time was equivalent of less than £2. Gyeongbokgung is very easy to get to by the MRT on line 3. It is closed on Tuesdays. Recommended time spent in this attraction: 1.5 - 3 hours.  Firstly, before entering the actual Palace, on the left side of the entrance, there is a free service where you can wear the costume/uniform of the ancient imperial soldiers and take pictures for five minutes. There are timed slots where you can queue up and I think they allow up to 10 people per hour to borrow these costumes to take pictures. I didn't note down the times, but it was something like 11:15, 12:10, 13:15 etc till closing. I highly recommend this as it really adds to the overall experience.  At the entrance you will see guards in the ancient soldiers uniform standing guard and patrolling (much like the Queens guards in London) You can take pictures with them (but not if you are wearing the borrowed uniform - it is forbidden, we saw a girl get told off for doing this).  Inside the palace, though it's not as big or as grand as the Forbidden City in Beijing, houses the ancient architecture with the big halls for the Emperor, his Queens and officers which are beautiful and inspiring. The stone sculptures on the stairs and the roofs look amazing and the artwork inside the halls are exquisite. I definitely recommend a visit to Gyeongbokgung for anyone passing through Seoul, if not for the history then at least for the art that is the palace itself.",561,much
562,457,5022,"The palaces are beautiful, but this one is the largest, and is just amazingly beautiful. There is so much to see and the pagoda in the pond I spent hours looking at it. I went here twice, each time I found inner peace. Cheesy yes but true.",562,much
563,458,5048,"There is no doubt that the palace is grand and it covers a large area. I did get the feeling though that it was a shell and that outside of foreign tourists there was little else going on there. The buildings themselves that surround the main palace are all empty and you can only go inside a couple of buildings that were furnished by the Spartans.  I think if you goto Seoul, you do HAVE to visit but don't expect too much apart from a clean pretty palace with nice gardens.",563,much
564,459,5051,"Much of this palace has been recreated following destruction, but it is very much worth seeing. The structures as well as the gardens and grounds make for a wonderful experience.",564,much
565,460,5059,"It is one of the top ten tourist destination in Seoul so don't miss it if you are here for the first time. It is big place and offer free museum entry, although you will need to pay 3000 won to get to see inside the palace but it is worth it absolutely.  Very easy access as it is connected to the Gyeongbokgung station, just walkout of the station as it is right in front of you ! Can spend just one hour there to have a quick tour if you are not into too much history !",565,much
566,461,5060,"Well if you ask us the history and what the guide was talking about , we were actually not much into it, but the beauty is too good. One of the main attraction to be visited when you in Seoul. Change of guard ceremony was interesting we were there I think 3pm or 4pm and we got to see it!",566,much
567,462,5061,"To understand Korea's 5,000 years of history & ties to Confucius theology, one needs to set aside some time & wear comfortable shoes to walk thru these grounds, see the restored beautiful and best of all five palaces - much like going to BJ to see China's Forbidden City. Our escorted group tour took us via the back by way of the Blue House (Presidential compound - like America's White House) onto the vast complexes - once housed over 7,000 rooms in its 500 buildings, ancient & historic designs in harmony with nature, haven & earth - and how once Imperialistic Japan virtually nearly destroyed SK's rich history and artifacts. The performances, special showings and the daily changing of the ""costumed"" guards are extra bonuses when timed - otherwise, there's plenty of see, visualize and appreciate - of a nation and its people, proud and mindful of its past while steering ahead of its destiny - despite its modern day South-North separation and threats of war.",567,much
568,463,5080,"I signed up for a free tour from the visitkorea.or.kr website and thoroughly enjoyed the place. The guide Jun, a retired South Korean volunteer, was excellent in giving our small group of four the background to the palace and use of different buildings in Gyeongbokgung. I learnt so much about this palace and its inhabitants during the Josen era in the two-hour tour, from why there are three entrance gates and why they have different heights to the different uses of the different kitchens in the palace. It was really intriguing to also see the sun dial invented during that period by one of the scholars and more importantly how it is used. Do I recommend this place? Yes but especially if you have a guide to help you fully appreciate the rich culture and history this palace embodies.",568,much
569,464,5083,If you visit seoul you must go to Gyeojgbokgung. It is very beautiful and very huge so prepare yourself with water and snakes if you have to but my advise is to eat well then go. It is much better to visit it early in the morning or after 11 I'm not sure which times it opens but after 4 pm will be so crowded,569,much
570,465,5091,"I enjoyed this palace. It is a very big area and you could be there for hours. There are some guards at the entrance in traditional dress so that is interesting. If you have been to China, this is very much the same as sites there. I visited quite a few in China, so just this one would have done me. If you have never seen anything like this then you must go.",570,much
571,466,5092,Good for history buff and also to witness the change of guards. Accessible by train (gyeongbokgung station exit 5) but shouldn't spend too much time here.,571,much
572,467,5094,"One of the few palaces in Seoul, a favourite amongst tourists.  It is small in size and if one has visit The Forbidden City in Beijing, this palace is much smaller in scale. It does not have the opulence and grandeur as normally seen in a palace.  Must understand the history behind the palace and how it was largely destroyed during the Japanese invasion and the palace was only rebuilt in the 1990s due to shortage of funds. So what we see now is a rather new landmark.  To make it interesting, one can also enjoy the walk around the palace in the traditional costumes i.e. hanbok but the rental shop isn't inside the palace, One has to rent from the shops outside the palace.  In my visit, it was really enjoyable to see a few local girls dressed in colourful hanbok, and they welcome picture moments with you.",572,much
573,468,5099,I strongly recommend a visit to the palace. We visited wirh out 4 years old son and had a lovely time. We started with the National folk museum and visited the palace on the way back to the metro station. I recommend this because you will experience much shorter waiting time to purchase a ticket,573,much
574,469,5101,"The grounds of this palace are expansive and you can wander around for hours, seeing the gardens, ornamental ponds and many palace buildings .You can also witness the colourful changing of the guards ceremony which is staged at regular intervals, or participate in a free english tour (these depart 3 or4 times a day). It does tend to lack a little character because basically all the buildings are new and there is nothing much inside the buildings to see (it was ""restored"" after being destroyed in the distant past). It also does get very crowded. However the entrance fee is a modest W3000 (or you can get a combined W10000 ticket and visit 4 sites within 3 months) and it makes for a pleasant diversion. You can also visit the folk museum at the side of the palace (for free) which also has a very interesting open-air section of historic shops, buildings and statues. Certainly worth a visit when in Seoul.",574,much
575,470,5104,"i don't know where or when but the moment i walked out the train station for this palace, i was in love. i had come just as the changing of the guards happened, it was so amazing. i can honestly say, i enjoyed everything, from the random pots of flower to maps in the floor. i had so much fun just walking around and taking pictures. you were able to view into the palace rooms but they were still in preserve. everything was perfect.",575,much
576,471,5110,The palace has so much history. It is definitely one of the most famous palaces in Seoul that one has to visit. getting to palace is quite straightforward. Spend more time in the palace and explore all the rooms.,576,much
577,472,5128,"There's not much of ancient Korean history you can see in Seoul. And this palace is a must see. However it is less well maintained and less impressive than, say, its equivalents in Japan. (I realize that 35 years of Japanese colonial rule may have contributed to the comparatively poor state of Seoul's palaces). I would also replace the thin sand with gravel (grass?) as ground cover. Otherwise it feels a bit dusty.",577,much
578,473,5159,"A vast, sprawling and frankly uninspiring estate of allegedly very old palace buildings, of which all were empty inside, and which had been so thoroughly refurbished in and out it looked as though they'd been built last year. There are vast open flagged spaces between each of the buildings, and probably the least unattractive is the one in the picture on Tripadvisor. There is the changing of the guard - a bit of a Disney luridly-coloured 'show'. with the actors not looking as though they're enjoying it much either. What saves it is the intricate tilework, soffits and external dressing of the buildings, which are worth photographing. There are barely any cafes inside so bring plenty of water.",578,much
579,474,5160,I did my daughter's first birthday photo shoot here. Well maintained. Huge. too much walking and too much to look around. Best to visit in fall or spring. Palace tours available in different languages.,579,much
580,475,5169,"Wow, beautiful palace and so unique. We didn't go inside but we're already so much impressed with the beautiful and immense outside. Watch the nicely dressed guard in their original costumes at the front gate. From you walk in 10 min to Insadong",580,much
581,476,5171,It is a beautiful palace! With a nice park around the palace. But the other famous palace which is bigger looks exactly the same. I recommend going to one of the palaces if you don't have that much time.,581,much
582,477,5185,"My perception of Seoul before actually visiting was that is a largely artificial city with no real history or culture relative to places like Hong Kong. Seeing Gyeongbokgung Palace and a some of the other cultural sights during my visit proved me wrong.  I happened to arrive around when an English language tour was about to begin, so I joined up (it was free). I won't give any spoilers, but the guide helped me understand why Seoul might not have quite as much of its pre-modern history on display compared to some other cities.  Further, the on-going work to rebuild Seoul's heritage sites is impressive and uplifting. I'll look forward to future visits to see it unfold.",582,much
583,478,5189,I recommend a tour because I regret not getting one. It was still interesting and worth seeing. The temples have a lot of beauty and great detail to them. I expected more greenery but I'm assuming that's too much for cost of upkeep,583,much
584,479,5211,"Right in the heart of Seoul, this is a must-do if you are interested in learning about the history of Korea. The palace grounds are beautiful. Be sure to do yourself a favor and hook up with a tour guide so you can learn as much as possible. And bring your camera because the sites are amazing",584,much
585,480,5225,"A must see when traveling to Seoul. There is much history in beauty in this palace! The Joseon period is a huge part of Korean history. I highly recommend doing a guided tour; they're free and happen multiple times everyday. The tour guides know a lot about the place and its history, and you see a lot of the palace without getting overwhelmed by its complexity.",585,much
586,481,5249,Very beautiful. The best out of the 4 palaces in Korea. It is optional to buy a group pass to visit all 4 palaces. I will not recommend it unless you have plenty of time to visit all 4 palaces. Its pretty much the same.,586,much
587,482,5284,"Enjoyed a walk through this palace, partially with the English tour that`s included in the entry fee. The palace is really nice. The guided tour was informative and added to the experience, although the guide did go much in the detail neither followed a chronology.The only real disappointment is that you need to book in advance to enter the palace building on the west side (surrounded by a small pond).",587,much
588,483,5302,"I happened to be here during July which apparently all the palaces and museums are open for free!!! and also coincidently to have enjoyed the free guided tour provided by the palace, all of which has made the whole experience so much better!",588,much
589,484,5305,"This palace has been destroyed, twice I think, so what you can see today has been entirely rebuilt. The grounds are huge and nice for a stroll around - but there isn't too much to see here in terms of exhibits, etc. The changing of the guard ceremony has interesting music and costumes and my kids really enjoyed seeing it.",589,much
590,485,5332,"I and my family members enjoyed visiting this palace. And we had so much fun wearing the guard costumes and having some great photos, too. It was nice to see the moment of of guards changing the shifts.",590,much

592,487,5354,"Well,maybe because i expected it too much so when i got there i was disapointed. If you wanna go there,it is not far from the station. But i forgot the station's name. It is kinda confusing to reach it,you must really remember the station's names since typical station in Korea are almost same. It costs about 3,000 won.",592,much
593,488,5361,"This palace in my personal Seoul palace rating gets well-deserved 2nd place. It doesn't differ much from acrhitecture point of view from other palaces, but nonetheless it's beautiful and impressive. Guard ceremony is interesting. You can check times of ceremony at the gates - there is info sign with schedule and type of ceremony.",593,much

Especially I was comfy with strong security in Korea and Korean were quite kind and warmhearted. Anyway it is very recommendable to visit Korea with your family.... I went to two palaces as my guide's recommendation... actually she preferred 2nd palace named Changdeokgung palace.Gyeongbokgung palace is representative, I was told it is the biggest one... it looks like forbidden city but it was built up around 30 years later than Gyeongbokgung palace. I went to Chankdeokgung palace as well. it is 2nd palace... there are 5palaces in Korea. the second palace was completely different.. it is also recommendable with many interesting history.SEEING IS BELIEVING.My tour guide was very enthusiastic and her story telling was so helpful to understand ,catched our concentration and touched us.. it was one of my strong impressing in Korea until the end day.. My collegue let me know one tour agent in Korea. We stayed for 5days, except for one day, we joined guided tour with her. she was very proud of their company(tour agent).. she was professional. When you travel to Korea, I want you to be with a good tour guide with very forsure agent. The agent name was very unique.. Anneonghaseyo Tour.. haha..It was available to have costomised tour with very reasonable budget...I was told it was handled by family that's why I could trust much more than other contries for trip. If you have any plan to travel to Korea, contact here.. I have business card of that agent.. Everyone will be satisfied with ...",595,much
596,491,5383,It is definatly worth a visit but don't expect too much. Korea is still rebuilding and getting their sites back to their former glory after the Japanese occupation. It was good and it is worth a visit but I would recommend a walk around changdeokgung palace and it's secret garden if you only have time for one,596,much
597,492,5400,Nothing much to see. The guards are unusually dressed in red and blue and are worth a look. The palace is a series of bulidings in a large walled compound with gardens and plenty of gravel.,597,much

601,496,5427,"The complex was great to see and explore. Most things have an english translation, so it is very US tourist friendly. I did the audio tour and there was a good bit of history, but not as much information about how the buildings were used as I would have liked.",601,much

603,498,5442,"It is a huge palace but basically looks the same after awhile. Interesting to see the guard change ceremony. Probably the only one that worth seeing, the rest would pretty much be smaller scale than this one.",603,much

605,500,5463,"Whether you have 36 hours or a more extended stay in Seoul, you should definitely stop by Gyeongbokgung (gung = palace). There are several palaces in Seoul but this one has the largest compound. If you don't much about Korean history, I would recommend the guided tour (which I think is free) and is offered in several languages and throughout the day. It's interesting hearing about the function of the different buildings and getting a sense of Koreas's imperial history. Definitely must see/do.",605,much
606,501,5469,"The site is huge, and there are so many aspects of the property that the best thing is to join a free tour so that you can learn as much as possible about life in the palace. Certainly worthy of a visit. Plan at least 2 hours.",606,much
607,502,5473,"clearly one of the things not to be missed in SEOUL, if you are into monuments. I have lived 5 years next to the palace to know it quite well under many different seasons, Winter can be quite nice with SUN and SNOW. Expect people but the palace is big, however not as big as the FORBIDDEN City in BEIJING. There is a FOLKS museum inside that is worth visiting (you need 1.5 h) and you can have a lunch there, quite nice to take a break from the busy city. Dont expect to see much furniture into the buildings, Korean Palaces are always very barren...the whole thing makes an enjoyable experience for a half day.",607,much

609,504,5481,"this is 1 of the 2 palaces you can visit in Seoul, it's probably the main one people visit, it's truly magical and picture perfect. it gives you a great sense of how the royalties lived and there's so much history in this place, even though a lot of the buildings were not the original as some of them have been destroyed by fire, but they did a great job of reconstruct them to their initial appearance. I enjoyed it a lot and spent about 2-3 hours there :)",609,much
610,505,5482,"We were amazed at how beautifully presented all the buildings were. They were lacking in information though, even the tour guide didn't tell us much. Great place. Must see. Do some research before so you know more about it.",610,much
611,506,5491,"We were there when it was the peak of autumn, and the beautiful palace garden was filled with bright colours. As many other reviewers would point out, it would be good to come in time for the guard-changing ceremony, where you get to see the different units marching around in the main square. You can plan in advance with the ceremony timings here: http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_2_1.jsp?cid=292853.  The grounds are clean and well-maintained, although I wouldn't wax lyrical about the sights (other than the garden yes). I might have unfairly compared this to Beijing's Forbidden Palace, but if you have been to Beijing, you might get what I mean. Nothing that much to see when you really look into each of the halls or rooms here.  It's a short walk to Samcheongdong (use the eastern exit, and work north for 7-10mins), so you could always plan to have lunch or teatime at one of the cafes or restaurants there.",611,much
612,507,5496,"Beautiful Place. It was winter so there wasn't much greenery but it is still very nice. Also got to see the 'Changing of the Guards"" ceremony. Very informative. Can't wait to go back in the summer.",612,much
613,508,5532,"5 visits to Seoul, I came here thrice! I specially visit the place again as my previous trip I came in early autumn and mid autumn. Very much wanted a view of the palace in winter! It's lovely, the only thing is it will be more beautiful if it snowed. Simply loved this attraction so much! A great way to spend a morning in Seoul... I'll be back here again in the other seasons.",613,much

616,511,5571,"This is a must if you are in Seoul as there are so much to see and do around the area Recommend that you can start the morning walking around the strip just in front of the palace where there is a museum of sort underground. Then have boiled ginseng chicken lunch at a nearby restaurant (there is a famous one nearby) before heading to the Palace. At the Palace ground, you can witness the changing of guards, and sometimes traditional dance performance, and also a visit to the museum inside. Spend the late afternoon walking along the street at the right of the palace (when you are facing the main entrance) which are lined with boutique shops and restaurants. You can also walk up the hill and look at the traditional houses.",616,much
617,512,5591,Beautiful palace. We would have left much earlier if we didn't jump in with the English tour guide. Probably would have given a lower review if not for the guided tour. Without the tour there wouldnt have been much to see.,617,much
618,513,5592,"A wonderful place to see. I saw some previews of Korean telenovelas but I don't pay much attention to it. Seeing this place, now I appreciate it more. A huge place and lots of history in it. It's worth a visit or 2. Take your time.",618,much

But I missed them as the place is too big.. Visit the museum on the outside of the entrance before u left, U can learn lots regarding the palace there..  Two significant in one time.. Yeah! Gwanghwamun and Gyeongbokgung. Save the subway fare.. Plus, u can walk down to the Gwanghwamun Square to visit the King sejong statue and also the Admiral Statue..",621,much

624,519,5642,The palace is quite huge so we were lucky to have followed a free English tour guide from the visitor center. We avoided the crowds as much as we could while still seeing all the major attraction the palace had to offer. The tour was almost an hour long but it gave us further insight to the history and lives of those living inside the Gyeongbokgung.  The ticket also comes with free admission to the folk museum located within palace grounds.,624,much
625,520,5648,"Great palace, for reference it is much smaller than the forbidden city, but the gardens and the lake give something else to this palace. In my opinion it would be my first choice when comparing with Changdeokgung, nevertheless both attractions deserve a visit. I would set from 90 min to 2h for a good look around.",625,much
626,521,5651,"It was an unintentionally visit for me. Been there since 2013, 13 hrs before my next connecting flight so that was the chance to get around in the city.  The palace has nothing much to see, building style is the combination between Japanese and Chinese. I was not sure about the ticket price but it was worth for paying.  If you wanted to pin this on your travel map that's fine, but for me once is enough. There is something else to see in Seoul.",626,much
627,522,5660,Very beautiful palace with a very tranquil feeling. Really worth a visit. So much history. The staff is very helpful.,627,much
628,523,5664,"We asked the taxi driver for Changdeokgung but he took us here instead. Apparently Changdeokgung is closed on Mondays. This place is huge & simple, not much to see except for the Korean Folk Museum. We missed the National Museum, so make sure not to miss it. We also watched the palace guards marching in traditional costumes. Lots of photo opportunities. Overall a very good visit.",628,much
629,524,5668,"Very big & crouded palace. From my visit, after doing pretty much all the palace section, I've came to realize that it pretty much looked the same.. Therefore, it's up to you guys to decide if it's really worth it. I did enjoyed the guard change !",629,much
630,525,5675,"The palace is old, and surprisingly small. Perhaps I just did not see too much into the history of the place. I noticed though that they have put more significance in places that would not have been significant had it not been for tourism purposes. But the facade of the building is interesting. It is a good place to visit one time. Just to get it out of your system. But not to revisit.",630,much
631,526,5676,"Following the style of the Forbidden City in Beijing, Gyeongbokgung is much less impressive but what's great about it is the pine grove and white sand ground that make it feel so aged and natural. In ancient time, Korea didn't have a big forest to build a large palace as China did. The woods for the palace were delivered from China, to whom it used to submit. Thus the houses are much smaller, especially the doors are low and narrow. Interesting place to learn about the country.",631,much
632,527,5690,"This palace is unbelievably large. You definitely want to have a guide, whether a human guide or an electronic one. We were traveling with our own guide and we learned so much about the Korean people and the buildings in which their royalty lived. The buildings are beautifully painted, with very bright colors. Be sure to look at the ceilings in all the buildings because they are decorated very elaborately (inside and out). This is a ""must see"" in Seoul!",632,much
633,528,5692,"I took a guided tours to visit the Palace. Gyeongbokgung itself means ""the palace blessed by Heaven"". This is a complete historic building to let you learn more about Korean people way of life and their historical life. I would recommend to take guided tour because of not so much signage or maps available to allow self guided tour. If you are lucky, you will be able to see the Guard Change ceremony on the main gate. Behind this palace, there is a Presidential House called 'Cheonghwadae' or 'Blue House'. Prepare yourself for a lot of walking, from the main gate to the exit gate.",633,much
634,529,5693,Good way to spend a couple of hours in Seoul. Guided tours are essential because there is not much in the way of signage or walking maps available to allow you to do a self guided tour. The complex is sprawling so without a tour guide you will have no idea what you're looking at. Be prepared for lots of walking.

The information are also clear and they are everywhere, so don't be afraid you've got lost :)  Nearby, there are also a Children's museum (?) that you can also visit by paying some fees. I don't know much since I am just passing by, but I saw the sculpture on their front door. It seems nice.",635,much

637,532,5745,"This is on my list of must see on my first day in Seoul and it didn't disappoint. True to its description, it's a grand palace with imposing gates, stunning throne hall and large lawns for leisurely walks. The palace is huge and doesn't have much information around so it's advisable to go with a tour guide. Either join the free tour given by the palace or sign-up for free walking tours from visitseoul.net. I think the latter is much better because the group would usually be much smaller than the ones who join the free tour by the palace.  Once you're done touring the palace grounds you may want to check out the Blue House and National Museum which are both strategically located behind the palace. Oh! don't forget to checkout the changing of the guards at the from yard which happens like every hour or two.",637,much
638,533,5777,"This is a grounds that contains a palace and various affiliated buildings. It was partially rebuilt in 1867. There is a modest 3000 won entrance fee so you are not risking much to go in. We toured the palace and grounds on our own. The replica buildings are magnificent and ornate but there is inadequate description of the history and contextual setting of the buildings. Also you can look into many of the buildings but you cannot actually go inside. We did not engage a tour guide as we wanted the freedom and informality to explore on our own but there is generally inadequate information (plaques, descriptions) to really appreciate the grounds and the replica buildings. If you really want to appreciate the site a tour guide is needed. There are some ramps for handicap access but there are also many steps. This destination is a work in progress as a tourist attraction but at modest cost it is interesting for a short time.",638,much

It is well worth the entrance fee, because there are just too much to see. be sure to watch the guard changing ceremony that take place at 10 am at the main entrance. I think it last for about half an hour or so. There are so many palaces in Seoul, but this one is the probably the most visited and most beautiful.",639,much
640,535,5785,"I visited Gyeongbokgung in November of 2010 and May of 2014. In 2010, I visited the palace as part of a tour and this year I had the opportunity to visit again, but at night (the palace is only opened at night during certain times of the year). Both experiences were great, just completely different. In 2010, the tour was a great opportunity to see so much of the palace grounds, plus the Folk Museum and learn a lot of history along the way. Our time in the palace this year was much shorter (simply based on our schedule), however it was amazing to see the palace transform as the sun set. Whether you have a few hours or maybe just 30 minutues, Gyeongbokgung is definitely worth a visit.",640,much
641,536,5808,"Quite a mouthful to pronounce, Gyeongbokgung actually means ""greatly blessed by heaven palace"". Originally built in the 14th century, most of the buildings were destroyed over time but have now been faithfully reconstructed. Apparently some of the original buildings still exist. If you only have a day or two in Seoul make sure you visit this palace. The magnificent Gwanghwamun entrance gate overlooks a major square which is also worth visiting. The buildings take you back in time to the Joseon Dynasty and, if you're really into these kind of palaces, I suggest you take as much time as you like. We felt a couple of hours was enough for us but enjoyed roaming around and taking in the historic atmosphere which contrasted nicely with modern day Seoul. Better to get there as early as possible to avoid the crowds although make sure you see the changing of the guard. This colourful reenactment takes place 3 times a day, between 10 a.m and 3 p.m, and is well worth watching. The guards are dressed in royal uniforms and carry traditional weapons and musical instruments. For a moment you feel you are actually living in the 14th century.",641,much
642,537,5815,Not sure if it will be every Sunday that they have the changing of guards as it will be boring if you goes there without any 'show' or even a tour guide to guide you along. We were greeted by a teacher before we reached the palace. She had offered her student to bring us around the palace for a tour as part of the boy's curriculum. The cute Korean boy was indeed very good and speaks very good English. Entrance to the palace = Won 3000 only.  I enjoyed very much on every corner of this palace and after knowing the history behind it. I happened to be there during the cherry blossom and it was indeed very beautiful seeing the blooming flowers.,642,much
643,538,5842,"If you are just going to Seoul for shopping, I'll say you may not like going to these historical places which can be a little dry.  But it's highly recommended especially for 1st time visitors to take some time off to read, see and learn how is the history like and how much hv been destroyed after the war. Take your time to stroll the gardens to take the city stress away. Try on the guards uniform for a fun photo taking at no costs.  Every country's historical buildings are to be respected for what they have been through with time. So we think its not a fair comparison to compare the different palaces. Just have an open mind to learn more of what was recorded during that era.",643,much

This place is HUGE and has so much stuff inside! You really need to set aside a lot of time for this area! There are 3 museums in the area you can see (one is hidden under the statue of a man sitting on the street in front). After you check out the changing of the guards, you can check out tons of buildings on the inside. If you bring kids, this is definitely a full day!

The property is beautifully maintained and there is so much history around it. This should be part of every first-time visitor's itinerary. Be sure to wear comfortable shoes as there is a lot of ground to cover. I went in January, at the height of the Korean Winter, but enjoyed the walking tour immensely, despite the cold. Get there early in the morning (I arrived before 10AM) to avoid the queue at the ticket booth and the crowds. Don't miss the colorful Changing of the Guards ceremony that happens daily at 11AM. At the end of the ceremony, there's an opportunity to have your photos taken with the guards. The entrance fee of KRW3000 -- roughly US$2.50 -- is a small price to pay to see this picturesque, historical attraction. From my personal experience, it's not necessary to pay to join a group or package tour to get to this attraction. It's easy to get to this place. I went on my own and didn't have any issues. From my hotel in Myeong-dong District, I took the Seoul Metro (move from Line 4 to Line 3) to get there. Exit 5 takes you right to the doorstep of the Palace Museum, a few steps from which you'll find the ticket booth for the Palace itself. When you get to the Palace, there are free information brochures in all languages and best of all, free guided tours. English tours are scheduled at 11AM and 1:30PM.",648,much

650,545,5922,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is interesting in the fact that it layed in ruins for over 200 years! From the late 16th century until the mid 19th century Gyeongbokgung was abandonded, Changdeokgung Palace was the main palace of the royal family during this time. Therefore, it must be noted there is basically nothing inside the palace that dates before the major rebuilding period of the 1860's.  So while there are a few buildings that are between 100 and 150 years old, sadly much of the palace was destroyed during the Japanese Colonial period. What we see today is a masterful reproduction of the original with a few important authentic Joseon buildings still remaining. Most of the buildings that we see are very recently built, just in the last 20-30 years.  Nevertheless, I always enjoy my time here. For one, the palace has a grand atmosphere, the buildings are large and are built in classic Joseon architecture. My favorite palace is without a doubt Changdeokgung, in large part because it is the best preserved palace and the gardens are exquisite. I do feel however, that the two palaces compliment each other. Changdeokgung is the authentic Joseon palace, which is typically called the most ""Korean"" of all 5 Joseon palaces. Gyeongbokgung is really a product of the final years of the Joseon Dyansty, and the architecture is built in a style that is supposed to legitimize the Korean King as an Emperor.  For anyone who enjoys history (like myself) you will enjoy Gyeongbokgung. I had plenty of time in Korea, so I was able to visit all 5 royal palaces on more than one occassion. If you only have time to visit one palace, visit Changdeokgung, but if you have more time, by all means enjoy the grand Gyeongbokgung Palace.",650,much

It meant cutting short the palace tour proper and queuing up for about two hours at a designated place. When noontime came, the attendant advised us that they would be closing for lunch and would be resuming at 1 pm. Since we were already next in line, our Korean guide pleaded that we be allowed a few minutes extension since our bus was no longer capable of waiting for us much longer.They understood our predicament and finally conceded. My daughter and i were given the choice of color and kind of costume we wanted to wear. A costumed Korean ""lady-in-waiting"" assisted the both of us inside the dressing room. She asked us to remove our rubber shoes and produced two pairs of Korean shoes for us to wear . She then motioned us, one at a time to go up an elevated platform, to spread our arms as she went about fastening the costumes in a wrap-around fashion on top of our shirt and pants. Our guide ably took our souvenir shots wearing these costumes at the palace grounds. We boarded our tourist bus, happy at having completed the Hanbok experience..",652,much

A vast expense of land in the center of Seoul yours for exploring at your own leasure without too much interference from low key museum staff. Take a camera of course and be prepared to walk away with hundreds of wonderful compositions from magnificant architectural roofs to detailed close-ups of ancient fixtures and doors. Well worth spending a half a day exploring preceded by and with a follow on late lunch or early dinner. High noon is the spectacle of spectacles with the changing of the guards, so don;t miss it. One of many palaces in and around Seoul but in my humble opinion the best preserved and most professionaly presented and maintained.",660,much

A few people brightly dressed as traditional korean warriors marched around a bit but didn't really do much else.  Pretty impressive overall though and a fairly large complex to explore. We had a group tour guide who was full of interesting information about the place, which brought it to life a bit more.  Some of it is original but much has been extensively restored, but done in a sympathetic manor.  I guess it depends how much you like this sort of place but we took about 1.5 hours to see all the major bits of the complex and I thought that was enough.",661,much

It was highly informative and provided me with a much richer experience than if I'd just bumbled through the place. For a moment I stopped to listen to the free tour and it seemed quite worthwhile, too, providing even more color than the audio guide. I would recommended it if you're into a slightly more structured walk. My favorite part? Hyangwonejong in the back - a phenomenally beautiful pagoda and pond. I could have spent hours there.",663,much

This was on the top of my list. I arrived in Seoul and stayed at the Sky Hotel which had free shuttle service and was two blocks from the metro for downtown Seoul. Excellent location!!! Took the metro to the Palace and arrived just in time for the changing of the guards which was absolutely beautiful and very entertaining with music, costumes, drums, marching bands, etc. I enjoyed it so much that after I toured the palace and grounds, I stayed for the next guard change which is on the hour. The Seoul metro makes it very easy to get around the city and it is very reasonable also. Two days was enough time to see most of the important sights of the city. Food was delicious esp. the area called the Samcheongdong with its wonderful street food. Also went to the Jeongdong theatre for the ""Miso"" showing (full house).

It was a re enactment of a feast day and I managed to see much of it before I had to leave.

669,564,6036,"The name ""Gyeongbok"" translated as ""Palace Greatly Blessed by Heaven"" seems somewhat of a misnomer given that it was destroyed by fire at least twice and the scene of much murder and mayhem during the Joseon Dynasty.  All visits begin at the rebuilt front entry which leads into a wide, open courtyard. At noon, we saw the colorful changing of the guard ceremony which was accompanied by drums and horns. A not-to-be-missed event!  Along with the admission ticket, you receive a pamphlet showing the palace complex layout and details about the buildings. These should be read carefully, or the place just looks like a bunch of empty buildings, along with bridges and walls decorated with stone mythical beasts. The government has done a magnificent job restoring this treasure, except they really need to install more trash cans!  The complex deserves at least 2-3 hours, although I suspect tour guides do not give their charges that long. I'd advise wearing really comfortable shoes. There is no problem finding a taxi to elsewhere in Seoul from out front of the complex. If you walk a bit, there are many restaurants around.",669,much

Gyeongbokgung is too crowded since it's the main center of the palace to be visited by the tourists. The main attraction would be the changing of the guards, the history of the palace, the national folk museum and the national museum.  However the last time I came here I can't enjoy it that much since it's very crowded with people. Even the pictures that I took were not as beautiful as ones I took at Deoksugung. Perhaps, one suggestion, come to Gyeongbokgung during weekdays, and not in a spring, winter, or summer break. People are coming not only from Seoul but also China and Japan. I really find it unattractive in a huge commotion like that.  Nevertheless, for 3000won, this area is really worth to visit. This palace area is so huge that even 3 hours will last like a flash. And make sure, you're not coming during holiday. It'll be an awful experience.You can't really enjoy the scenery since it's too noisy and crowded.",679,much

Depending on the time of the day, you will be able to experience the changing of guards at the entrance of the palace.

684,579,6134,"This palace can be covered in much less time, but I spent about 5 hours exploring. Took the free English Tour which leaves from the Information office at designated times. Tour guide was impossibly nice, but a little hard to understand. Still, she tried very hard to make sure we got the gist of what she was trying to say. My tour group at the peak of the day was only about 15 people which was a nice size. The tour took about an hour and she did provide a few minutes here and there for us to linger.  I also bought for 3000 Won, an audio tour (right next to where you buy your tickets). I do recommend this as it provided a good number of additional tidbits that the guidebook and tour did not. It is also on a GPS so the audio/video clips just start playing as soon as you come up to a landmark. So after my guided tour, I doubled back and visited most of the places again with my audio guide. Try to time it for the changing of the guards. Not as spectacular as some I've seen in other countries, but certainly worth checking out.  I ventured out to get a better look at the Blue House (out the back gate, just make sure you have your ticket for re-entry), but did not have time for the Folk Museum which you can also access from the side of Gyeongbokgung. Make sure you have plenty of water and food if you need it, with you if you're visiting in the summer months. There is only one cafe at which to buy food & drink and it is located towards the front. There are large circular drinking fountains if you're not picky, though these are more 'faucet like' so folks do 'wash' in these too. I saw them cleaned frequently though.  I was surprised at how precarious many of the spots were - you have to climb to most of the buildings on rather tall stone steps. The ground is stone paved in many places and the stones are roughly hewn and you can easily trip. Just be aware if you're planning to go with anyone with mobility issues or young children.  I took the subway to get here. Get to Gwanghwamun station and there will be signs and maps that lead you to Gyeongbokgung. It was an easy 5 minute walk straight ahead from the exit that I took.  The only thing to realize is this palace has been completely restored from the ground up after it was razed by war and fire, so it is all a 'replica' if you will, if you are a real stickler for that. That aside, I think it is well worth at least a couple of hours visit.",684,much

The guards at the main gate were incredibly still as tourists posed beside them.  The 1100 changing of the guard was impressive: much music amid solemn ceremony and marching.  The Palace's reconstructed buildings occupy a large area. Reconstruction is ongoing with some traditional cottages being built.  The entrance fee (KRW3000 was particularly good value). One can combine this with a visit to the free National Folk Museum.  Don't come on Tuesdays: it is closed.",685,much

Do take the video tour, it has a built in GPS so the narration automatically starts as you approach each viewing point. The changing of the guards, every hour on the hour, is colourful and worth seeing. My favourite parts were the stone animal statues and the large pavilion set in the water.  Probably not interesting to small children as there's a lot of walking and not much to do.",686,much

For me it was like a dream to observe the Korean Traditions, History and culture, wearing Korean traditional, dress I felt myself a Character of King Sejong, the great.  I personally think we should preserve and promote our history and culture for the upcoming generations and the organizations like Touch Korea Tour are doing this in a remarkable way here in Korea. The visit of the National Museum of Korea introduce us to the culture of Korea, the seasons, bridal, birth and funeral ceremonies, music instruments and all that was very unique to us. It also gives us comparison of various ages of empowerment and emperors in Korea. It also tells a clear story of the downfall and rise of Korea. Our guide Sunny Park while explaining all the history of Gyeongbok palace created such an environment and interest that I felt myself to be a part of that era. She explained us the in detail about the various parts of palace and the ruling situation of various emperor. Indeed she proved herself a kind and competent resource person. It was very interesting and romantic to visit the Historical Street behind the palace. The Combination of modern and ancient culture of Korean Society was awesome. I recommend every visitor to visit Gyeongbok palace if you wana explore the real culture and tradition of Korea.",689,much

Beautiful grounds, most likely better suited for the history loving folks, who are able to imagine how these grounds must have looked and funtioned in the 15th century. Perhaps not so much for kids, teens or adults that require more visual stimulation for enjoyment.  The palace grounds could be enjoyed any time of the year, but probably best enjoyed during the mild weather months when a leisurely stroll through the lush grounds among beautiful flowers and tree blossums is possible.",691,much

I took hundreds of photos at Gyeongbokgung Palace to remind me of this incredible experience. The palace is a huge complex of several buildings and features a changing of the guard ceremony and lot of people in colorful traditional palace costumes.  Very highly recommended... especially if you can go with a Goodwill Guide.,692,much

For anyone who has seen the Forbidden City, Angkor Wat or the Grand Palace in Bangkok, Gyeongbokgung Palace might not pack much of a tourist punch.  Having said that, if you enjoy Korean history or just the pleasure of exploring culturally significant sites, then Gyeongbokgung is a good choice for a day trip - especially if you visit near-by Insadong-gil (Insadong street) and explore the many wonderful side streets, alleyways, temples and galleries that the surrounding neighborhood has to offer.  I also encourage a quick visit to the very nearby Bukchon Hanok Village. It's a collection of traditional houses and streets that have been protected and restored, and I think it provides an excellent complement to a day of cultural/historical exploration!",694,much

One thing I love about Korean public attractions is that they are reasonably priced, so you can return again and again. Obviously, as my first date, it has a special place in my heart, but it still has plenty to check out. It's also very convenient and close to many other attractions or places to go (Statue of Lee, biggest foreign language bookstore, Tomatillos). Over all, the palaces are very similar, except one has ""Biwon"" which is the secret garden (not Gyeongbokgung, though) If you have been to the Forbidden Palace in Beijing, you may be disappointed. It is very similar, but smaller, but has it's own beauty, nevertheless. By comparison, the process of getting in here is much easier. Since my husband and I are leaving after many years in Korea, we recently went back to take photos again. Second time around, it was beautiful and awe inspiring. It has sections designed to draw kids as well... I recommend it!",697,much

Besides the main pavilions, I recommend seeing the Hyangwonjeong Pavilion towards the north gate and the Gyeonghoeru (Royal Banquet Hall), set on water. But honestly, its worth it to just take your time and wander through the whole thing leisurely and read the posted information along the way.

Don't go expecting the splendor of a bygone era. The sprawling grounds are filled with identical buildings with little to differentiate from one to another.

Although reconstructed after much destruction by the Japanese colonists and relatively simple for a palace, the overall experience is great and the grounds make for a nice walk. Entry WRN 3,000. Be prepared for herds of tourists though during weekends & holidays, so probably during the week is a better experience. When I was there in August it was quite warm but above all very humid, so prepare for some serious sweating while walking the grounds. The National Folk museum in the back on the right is OK, if you have another hour and to cool off, but more interesting for locals than for foreigners. Entry for the museum is free.

Unfortunately there wasn’t much to see inside the palace buildings as everything has been removed.  Nevertheless, something not to miss on your Seoul holiday.

If you are coming out of the palace, turn to your left towards the station. when you hit the first traffic light, you will see lots of rental shops opposite. That's the place to rent your hanbok for photo taking. The palace itself was nice but probably I was expecting more. The palaces look pretty much alike and nothing much to see for us. Probably they do not have a richer and older history as China. We practically walk everywhere in the compound and our last stop was the library where you will have to take your shoes off and be real quiet! I don't think I enjoyed unless there was an event there.

Steeped in history, and quite well preserved, the Palace grounds we found were quite large, and filled with palace structures and artifacts. The interiors of the palace were quite well preserved, awash in colored interior spaces, and the palace was teaming in costumed Korean soldiers of around 16th century Korea.  The changing of the guard ceremony happens in the afternoon, and it's quite a flamboyant spectacle with many costumed participants. The ceremony lasts around a half an hour, and is well worth a pic or two. To add to the historical flavor, many locals come in costume to the Palace, and parade around the grounds. I had heard many weddings also take place at the Palace, however, that was just traveler talk, nothing from anyone official.  Self guiding audio tours with earbuds are available in many languages at the entry, and there seemed to be an ample supply. As far as entry costing goes, I have no idea, as it was included in our airport layover tour.  We found it worth the effort, and would recommend it to anyone exploring Seoul.",717,nothing
718,13,1067,I visited this palace today.  Wow - how boring can a palace be! This one takes the biscuit!! Lots of Koreans all garbed up in traditional Korean dress which they hire locally - even men so they get free admission. Selfies are the order of the day. We maybe just a bit of glamour.  Let's get down to hard facts. Lots of buildings - most closed with nothing to see. Those open / nothing inside - again empty rooms - nothing to see. Exceptions: the throne room has a throne in - basic and the Gyeonghoeru Pavilion is of national significance for its important part in architectural design and application.  This is not a place to visit even if it only costs 4000 won.  The National Palace Museum of Korea is in the same compound (admission free) is excellent.

This place is great for photography. So many different types of plants and flowers and lots of buildings to walk around and explore.  Yo will see many people walking around in ""Hanbok"" which is a traditional dress of Korea. Colourful and beautiful imo.  Grab a leaflet at the start which includes a map, its free and will ensure that you don't miss anything. There is also a way to see the ""Blue House"" which is where the president resides.

I did not see any maps for visitors to take along (maybe I missed it), hence, some places that I walked had nothing much to view.

It gives an insight to the palace and gives understanding to some of the building structures, such as chimney towers that are not noticeable. Heating under the building provided via tunnels.  To its defence, I supposed because the palace was burnt down during the early Japanese/Korean war, much of the original details in the palace was missing.

The only features of interest past the initial cluster of buildings were the small lake with the garden island (behind the main palace) and the large pavilion for official entertaining on a large lake to the west of the main section of palace buildings. A lack of clear signage made it hard to find where to go next. I spent an hour and a half wandering around until I lost interest but you could easily spend much more time here if you wanted to. I was a bit disappointed that the palace is largely just empty buildings you can only see from the outside - it is hard to appreciate the rich history of Korea when one buildings looks the same as the one you just saw.

Exhausted from our debate on how to properly pronounce 'Gyeongbokgung', we were instantly silenced upon being greeted by two stone sculptures. Was it a hairless lion, or a mythical beast? Something to debate as we explored the palace further.  Royal Guards dressed in traditional uniforms, swarmed in as we walked through one of three large red doors. Their spears pierced the heavens as they marched towards us in a ceremonial fashion. It was an amazing transition from the busy, modern streets behind the red gates of the palace; like stepping back in time. Alarmed at first, we were relieved to learn it was only the opening of the palace gates that we nearly interrupted.  After a pleasant ceremony feature, we proceeded through the massive courtyard, at the entrance, to the ticket booths. The ground was soft. The sand filling the courtyard was fine and yellowish orange in colour. I was fascinated by how comfortable it was to walk on it. I dimwittedly thought there was nothing more to the palace, beyond the courtyard. That was until we advanced further in through the palace's second second gates.  We spent 2.5 hours wandering the grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace, discovering amazing detail in architecture, beautiful natural scenery, and a taste of Korea's history and culture through the people we encountered an learning about the demolition and restoration of the palace.  It was not too busy, but if you are trying to capture tourist free photos, you may have to be patient for the perfect moment :D I enjoyed viewing the city, which towered over the walls of the palace, from within the center of the palace. It was an exciting place to be; almost like viewing the future while standing in the past.  If you are Palace, Temple, Castle, etc. hoping throughout East Asia, do not miss this palace. There is also plenty to see and do around the palace if you have time to spare in Seoul.",747,nothing
748,43,3272,Honestly it looks a lot like Chinese palace with lesser stuffs It's big enough and a must see but then it was an ok place for me In front of the palace are expensive food and nothing special about it Just a must see then but not a must stay in the area,748,nothing
749,44,3289,"The place is vast but nothing impressive/memorable. The palace looks newly built rather than a historical site.Lots of vast , sandy open areas.

Japan has much better and more impressive historical site. If you don't have much time in Seoul, can skip this.",749,nothing

751,46,3363,"Gyeongbokgung is the main among ""Five Grand Palaces"" in Seoul – Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung and Gyeonghuigung. But! Its rival -Changdeokgung became UNESCO World Heritage from 1997. Why didn`t Gyeongbokgung become despite its historical meaning? Thanks to its history! It was twice destroyed by the Japanese during the invasion and occupation. Last time Japanese destroyed it as the symbol of national independence and sovereign power. That`s why most buildings inside are rather new. Not restored but built again. Palace is closed eaurly at 5.00. p.m. That`s why I could visit it just with 3rd attemt. We`ve lost 1-st day in Seoul due to Jetlag, 2-nd and 3rg days I arrived from Namhanseong and Suwon just at closure. I arrived just in time for the closing. And only in the morning before leaving for Busan, I was able to come almost to the opening. It was a weekend and the Babylonian pandemonium was in the Palace. But mostly Koreans participated in Babylonian pandemonium. According to the traditional attitudes of the tourist to look at the Palace of nothing. No furniture. Sculptures no. Paintings either. In short, not Versailles, and not the Hermitage. If this is your first Palace, a slight disappointment or confusion can not be. I already had one Palace of the big five and 2 UNESCO world heritage in Suwon and Namhansanseong, so I was not surprised. Once ambivalent sense it is necessary to visit: Gangnyeongjeon (King's Quarters), Geunjeongjeon (Throne Hall), Gyeonghoeru (Royal Banquet Hall), Gyotaejeon (Queen's Quarters). They are almost the same. But next place will be romantic - Hyangwonjeong Pavilion near small lake. After that I would recommend to turn to right (East) and visit Korean folk museum. You`ll able to understand that the technological victories of Samsung, LG and Hundai on the world markets are not random, but prepared by the whole history of Korea. Entrance ticket is the same as in Gyeongbokgung.",751,nothing

Don't miss the changing of the guards, check the website for the times. you can take selfies with guards but they will never smile for you.

765,60,4624,"The Gyeongbokgung Palace is easily reached via the Purple Line 5 Gwanghwamun Station. The prominent huge statue of Emperor Sejong watches you as you stroll past him at the Gwanghwamun Square towards the Gwanghwamun Gate. It is a good 500m walk from the station.  The 3 colourful guards in traditional Korean military outfits stood solemnly at the Gate as tourists posed photos with them. Don't miss the changing of the guards. The entrance fee to the Palace proper is 3,000KRW including free entry to the National Folk Museum at the back. The Palace is nothing spectacular if you compared with those in Beijing, China like the Summer Palace or Forbidden City. It is just wide and big open sandy ground with squarish traditional houses. Nothing colourful or interesting. It would be nicer during the autumn or cherry blossom season. We were there in late March and all trees shed their leaves and look so gloomy.  The National Folk Museum is more interesting as it showcases the history of the Korean culture. You should spend more time in the Museum than walking aimlessly in the big wide Palace ground unless you take the free tour which offers better insight of Palace. We did not take the free tour as we missed the timing. The other highlights are the pagoda and the traditional Korean houses around the Museum vicinity.  We existed through the National Folk Museum road entrance instead of walking back to the Gwanghwamun Gate. We original wanted to have lunch at Tosokchon for the ginseng chicken (nearer to the Gate side) but the Museum Entrance staff showed us a cross arms indicating not worth the walk back to the Gate.

The courtyard costs nothing to enter, and that's where the aforementioned reenactment occurred.

770,65,4941,"While I was looking forward to this trip, I did not have any expectations whatsoever so as not to ruin the mood. This is the second palace I visited, and it lies just in front of two statues, one of the admiral and the other King Sejong, seated in a chair, and founder of the Korean alphabet. The ticket entrance was 5000 won, a bit hefty if you ask me. The tour started and I joined a tour with an English translator, kudos to the translator for really trying to explain the history and details of all the buildings.  The architecture and style can somewhat be likened to those found in Shanghai and Beijing, maybe because of cultural influences. I was a bit disappointed though because of the lack of English descriptions of each of the place. Signages are also scant in the area and be ready to endure long walks!  I suggest going here in the morning or early lunch time so that you can have time to visit the blue house which the guide said was one gate away only from inside this palace. Unfortunately, I didn't see the blue house.  In total, I find this palace, nothing special, an average if you ask me, but I commend the departments involved here for really making sure to preserve the edifices. So, in going to Seoul, choose wisely which among the palaces you'll be visiting. This one would not be in my list again.",770,nothing

There was a sense of grandeur and warmth that was unlike anything I ever saw and I didn't even really get to go inside to look properly. It's a must see in Seoul for a reason.

It does tend to lack a little character because basically all the buildings are new and there is nothing much inside the buildings to see (it was ""restored"" after being destroyed in the distant past). It also does get very crowded. However the entrance fee is a modest W3000 (or you can get a combined W10000 ticket and visit 4 sites within 3 months) and it makes for a pleasant diversion. You can also visit the folk museum at the side of the palace (for free) which also has a very interesting open-air section of historic shops, buildings and statues.

It's a large compound so wear comfortable shoes and bring a camera. If you have one with a good zoom lens it will come in handy, as you can't actually go into many of the buildings.  You can't miss this if you go to Seoul, the architecture is nothing you've ever seen. Breathtaking to see the details and colors used when everything was built. Buy a guide for 50 cents, it will give you information and a cheap souvenir to take with you. It's only a couple dollars for admission, worth it to walk the grounds.

You can take the guided tour or go around on your own. It's not very difficult to go around, and the maps indicate which are the notable landmarks to visit.

787,82,5922,"Gyeongbokgung Palace is interesting in the fact that it layed in ruins for over 200 years! From the late 16th century until the mid 19th century Gyeongbokgung was abandonded, Changdeokgung Palace was the main palace of the royal family during this time. Therefore, it must be noted there is basically nothing inside the palace that dates before the major rebuilding period of the 1860's.  So while there are a few buildings that are between 100 and 150 years old, sadly much of the palace was destroyed during the Japanese Colonial period. What we see today is a masterful reproduction of the original with a few important authentic Joseon buildings still remaining. Most of the buildings that we see are very recently built, just in the last 20-30 years.  Nevertheless, I always enjoy my time here. For one, the palace has a grand atmosphere, the buildings are large and are built in classic Joseon architecture. My favorite palace is without a doubt Changdeokgung, in large part because it is the best preserved palace and the gardens are exquisite. I do feel however, that the two palaces compliment each other. Changdeokgung is the authentic Joseon palace, which is typically called the most ""Korean"" of all 5 Joseon palaces. Gyeongbokgung is really a product of the final years of the Joseon Dyansty, and the architecture is built in a style that is supposed to legitimize the Korean King as an Emperor.  For anyone who enjoys history (like myself) you will enjoy Gyeongbokgung. I had plenty of time in Korea, so I was able to visit all 5 royal palaces on more than one occassion. If you only have time to visit one palace, visit Changdeokgung, but if you have more time, by all means enjoy the grand Gyeongbokgung Palace.",787,nothing
