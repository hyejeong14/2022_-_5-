5.0,"We bought the package of the aquarium tickets together with the admission to Lotte World. We decided to visit the aquarium first as they do not allow rentry at the Lotte World. The aquarium was located at the other side of the Lotte mall. The aquarium was new and well space out onto two floors. As with all aquariums around the world, you get to see almost the same typical species of marine animals on display. However, they have the beluga whale that is our first seeing it up close in an aquarium. Interesting! You can also ""bottle"" feed the fishes on the second floor which is our first too. My boys had a fun times feeding the fishes through bottles. Is definitely a memorable experience for them.","Written December 26, 2019"

You can just walk through and look at the colorful species. I think I spend around 2 hours inside. Beautiful designs to take pictures, and have a good time with friends or family.","Written December 10, 2019"
4.0,"If you are going to the Gangnam area any way, apart from visiting the shopping mall, you may wish to reserve time for this aquarium. It is not a very big one and the advantage is that it is actually inside the Coex Mall and is wholly indoor. Though it is compact variety of fish is good. You can see shark, turtles, penguins, and many more. You can spend two hours there, and worth going even if you have one hour and are thinking what to do. Kids will enjoy.","Written October 18, 2019"

4.0,"Located in Lotte World Mall, it's a popular spot for tourists and locals alike. I'd advise going early for a visit as when the crowd's build-up, the experience can be a little harrowing (jostling for space to view the exhibits). Good educational fun for all ages and it's wheelchair and stroller friendly.","Written August 27, 2019"
3.0,"This is a popular aquarium in Lotte World. We weren't impressed. But, it's good to visit with kids once.  - It is 10~15 min walk from Lotte World Mall Entrance. Not that close. - Entrance fee is quite expensive. There are various discount rules by the way. Some of them will be available for foreigners too. Check the website before purchasing tickets. - We waited 20~30 min to buy the ticket. I was disappointed because we didn't have many people before us and their kind work is not that quick. - It was very crowded on weekday afternoon. We waited for our turn to see tanks mostly. I don't know how it's going to be worse on weekend. - The inside was dark. Not easy to get good photos. - They allow big strollers and it was pretty annoying for others. Sometimes those are risky when people don't notice in a dark area. - This is very ENTERTAINMENT friendly aquarium. They seemed take much efforts to attract family visitors. As well as watching and touching, they have various experience programs like scuba diving. If you are more leaning on underwater sanctuary, you'll probably be disappointed seeing fishes and marine creatures looping in relatively small tanks for them. - Unlike other common aquariums having the souvenir shops at the end, they have so many shops and food stalls on the way. - They don't have giant sharks like above three meter long. Instead, they have penguins, otters, sealions, etc. Belluga whales are the highlight of this aquarium. - The scale is smaller than we thought. It will take 1~2 hours if you don't staty long at each tank.","Written August 5, 2019"

Not a bad choice to see a wide variety here and the penguins was so playful and engaging! Jelly fish was so beautiful, seeing it glow. Great for the kids to learn more of the marine life.  Cons: The place was a little bit of confusing of where to go next. Like, left or right kind.","Written May 26, 2019"

If you're a foreigner, Trazy has a great combo ticket price for both the Aquarium and Lotte Adventure.... The belugas made me a bit sad because they seemed so bored-- just swimming in the same circles over and over. But the rest of the exhibits-- especially the huge tank with the giant rays-- are pretty stunning.","Written May 25, 2019"

We paid 60.000 won (50€) each, for a package deal including the aquarium, lotte tower and lotte world. And even though all three are worth a visit, the aquarium was the best. Having some great displays of fish and other animals like penguins, otters and whales.  The aquarium is in the same building as the lotte tower, and mall. Which are both enormous, with tons of stores and restaurants.","Written February 12, 2019"
3.0,"Its a nice place. Located at the basement of Lotte Mall, it shows some of the wildlife found in Korea. What interest me the most was to see the Beluga Whale. Gentle and playful creatures. The Spider Crab was another species that surprised me.  Have you seen the Flashlight Fish? Small fish that actually lights up in the dark? You can see it here.  Highlight would be the full screen aquarium. It is smaller than the one in Singapore but still gives a sense of foreboding as you watch the sea creatures.  Probably due to the amount of space, the aquarium makes full use of what they have.  To get here... Jamsil Station. Go to Lotte Mall.","Written December 24, 2018"

5.0,"I’ve been to a few other aquariums so I really considered carefully whether it was worth while going for this, especially on a national holiday when it was jam packed with people. I TOTALLY enjoyed myself and would say this is in fact the highlight of my entire Korea visit. I was there primarily to see the Beluga and it certainly didn’t disappoint. The Beluga seems trained to swim near to the side of the tank so it was really easy to take pictures/videos of them. Besides, I also enjoyed looking at the collection of strange frogs and extra large river fish, which I haven’t come across in other aquariums so far. Somehow I felt that the enclosures were really well built and gives you a feeling that the fishes are really near you, it is really quite different in a great way.","Written August 21, 2018"

The seals were very entertaining too.","Written July 11, 2018"

There were lots of varieties of fish to see. The jellyfish section was closed though... not sure if it costs extra or just really closed on the day I visted. I appreciated that the aquariums were huge and can be seen at various angles like tunnels or different sides of the tanks. I just feel bad that all were enclosed... I do hope that the animals have an open environment somehow where they can take a break and not look so enclosed (especially for the sea creatures).,"Written July 4, 2018"

It was a nice, clean, and cool place to go if you want to escape the summer heat and outside rain. The tanks were all kept clean and strategically spaced out so it's not too crowded with people. Our favorite areas were the beluga whales, the sea otter, and the short walkthrough with the overhead aquarium. The kids enjoyed it, and it was a good size so that it's not overwhelming for them.","Written August 2, 2017"

Some of the exhibits are not opened yet during our visit. I paid about 59,000 won for 3 pax if I didn't remember wrongly (1 adult, 1 youth and 1 kid below 6). There are a lot to see and I would recommend to anyone who love marine life and families with kids. I find that it is small compared to COEX Aquarium.

The area was well-kept and the marine animals look so happy!  the star of the aquarium was dugong and they were seen playing happily with balls and swimming around the huge tank. they appeared to be smiling and at times, they are seen swimming near to the visitors posing for photo taking  there are also quite a few backdrops for visitors to take photos, e.g. since i went during autumn and close to halloween, there is a backdrop that decorated with halloween pictures and items and another backdrop we saw is decorated with autumn related items. i think it is a wonderful idea. i saw many families with kids & couples are posing with the beautiful decorated backdrops.  there is also a small section for kids or anyone to do a touch/free of the starfish or other small marine creatures and dont worry about getting your hands dirty as there are washing basins with soaps right next to it!  as compared to S.E.A. aquarium that we have in Singapore Sentosa, i think this Lotte World Aquarium is much more fun. or maybe it's just me.. :)  There is also ample of space that is friendly for strollers, families and couples..  i would definitely recommend this place to my friends","Written November 28, 2016"

3.0,"If you don't have much to do, and are trying to kill 1-2 hours, this is a decent aquarium to attend. I might be biased, as the Osaka and Atlanta aquarium have set me with high standards. BUT, I do believe that this aquarium (compared to some of the best in the world) is sort of expensive, for what it has to offer. I believe that I either paid the same or more, to attend this aquarium, compared to top-rated aquariums, like the ones in Osaka, Japan and Atlanta, GA (USA). That being said, the animals/mammals that they have inside the aquarium seem to be well fed and have enough room to get around. If you go on the weekend, plan for it to be packed, as it was for our last trip. My family and I have went during the week, and there was no line to feed the fish or do anything other ""extra"" activities within the aquarium. Plan for a 10-20 minute wait on the weekends for those activities. All of this being said, this aquarium is NOT BAD, it's just sort of pricey, for what it has to offer. I recommend going here at least once, whether you're on vacation, or just trying to kill time. If you drive to Lotte World mall, you get a discount for the parking (if you attend the aquarium), so keep your receipt, as the parking is the most expensive as I've ever seen.","Written August 13, 2016"

The highlight is the hugs 2 story glass window where you feel as though you are in the ocean itself. Its amazing to see so many fish in one tank. There is also a little play area for small children to make things. It was really nice to have an arts and crafts place for kids as well as a feeding area where kids can feed fish. The only bottleneck is the Whale aquarium where its hard to see anything when its crowded and there is only one entrance and exit. Aside from that, its nice to spend a few hours there on a hot summer day. When you finish, you have the whole mall to peruse. I recommend it especially if you have children.","Written June 21, 2016"

My young one was gawking at walking under neath some portions of the aquarium and trying to get the seal to play with him through the glass.  There were fish and species I have never seen at other aquariums. A few of the seals had sense of humors and would play along with children movements swimming up to kids and following their hands around like a large shadow. There is so much information that if you want to read and learn about all of it please block of a decent amount of time. I would say three hours would be minimum.","Written March 19, 2016"
1.0,"We arrived aroun on Valentine’s Day at noon and were finished around 2pm. We payed 29,000KRW or about $24 for two hours! The shows occur around 11:00am and then again 4pm. We figured we would get our hands stamped and check out the Lotte Duty Free and Mall (My wife’s idea lol) and then return to see the Sea Lion and Beluga Whales’ show. To our profound amazement, they wouldn’t stamp our hand so we could return. They spoke decent English for purchasing tickets and for renting the audio guide but all of the sudden, the English proficient customer help didn’t speak a word of English as I tried to get our hands stamped to return. All they could say was they are sorry. Even with listening to the audio guide, the entire trip lasted 2 hours including multiple trips to the restroom by 4 people in a family, snacks such as a pretty decent churro etc… Had we not purchased the rental audio guides, the entire aquarium could be seen in under an hour as it is very tiny. One would think they would give the audio guide for free with the 29,000KRW price but then the audio guide rental is another 3,000KRW a person. Unlike the museums we’ve encountered with children and great teacher supervision, here parents let their children run wild here and even try to push you out of the way to let their children get a view. I could understand a child trying to get a good view and pushing, not having common sense or decency, but a parent pushing you out of the way? That was ridiculous and I surely told the parents to have some civility. What a waste of money and time with the Lotte World Aquarium. If you are considering or contemplating spending your hard earned money on Lotte World Aquarium I strongly advise you spend your money elsewhere and avoid the frustrations my family felt visiting the poorly run Lotte World Aquarium.","Written February 15, 2016"

It is small compared to large parks like Sea World in the US, but I think very comparable to the other aquariums in Seoul. Expect to see everything in 60-90 mins if you don't catch the shows around mid day and early afternoon. This location has beluga whales, penguins, sea lions, many different fish, hands on area and activity areas for small children. Very large single tank that is about 20-30 feet tall and over 100 feet long. Several tunnels for visitors to pass through tanks and be surrounded by the aquatic life. I recommend it, especially if you have small kids and visit in the morning to catch the shows.","Written December 12, 2015"
3.0,"We had expected much from this new Aquarium, but, it seems that it was designed by someone who hadn't designed or experienced the top Aquariums in the world, which bring fun, and, sensory-enhancing experiences, and, which are educational, interactive, and, family-oriented, This Lotte Aquarium is somewhat educational, but, it wasn't cohesive, and, even shabby.  1.5 hour was sufficient, and, we felt we were at a “temporary” exhibits, although every feture was permanent. The best part was the staff at the ticketing area, who are many times friendlier and cheerful than other Lotte employees throughout the 2-3 buildings, where their staff are alarmingly indifferent, lazy, and below-average in work ethics, due to the discouraging fact that the locals and the government did not support this new development but criticized them heavily when they first opened in 2014. Since the ground breaking day, Lotte have had nothing but the series of serious environmental issues, construction-related accidents, and, customer injuries, and the luxury item stores premature shutdowns due to mis-targeting consumer groups, and, the worsened public transport access discouraged anyone to go there for shopping. I tend to think this might be the embarrassing example of the poor-sighted development by a 2nd class developer, with the rushed oversighted process. Well, the Aquarium program is also a typical example to me.  Compared to top-notched Ripley's Aquarium in Toronto (AA), or, solid ancient Boston Aquarium (A), it wasn't even B-, it is at best C+. They need to reprogram the routes around the gigantic water tanks, and bring more interactive fun, starting with music and light effect for the visitors.  The Entrance fee was steep at 29,000 won ($25). Not a good value for the visit. They open late till 10pm. If you were disappointed, I suggest exploring the new Lotte World Tower Mall (Aquarium in B1 level). It has lots of late night dinner places at the upper levels that you will experience the good authentic Korean dishes and snacks on 5th floor.

On the first night we thought it was a novelty but we quickly realised that some of the food wasn't as cheap as we thought. Some of them vendors reheat food by using those gas flame lighters so they're not fresh off the grill or reheated on it. As well as it being unbelievably busy, there was rubbish everywhere, it was a bit of a turn off. Worth a visit if you're into k-beauty though but wouldn't come here just for the food stalls.

Some restaurants have a 2nd or 3rd floor, so do go in and check with host/hostess for availability, and don't just assume there's no seating when the main floor is full. There are lots of street vendors along Myeongdong-Ro (St) where they sell gimbaps, deep fried squids, etc...which you may fancy. For tourists, you will find good exchange rates in this area too.

4.0,"We were in Seoul overnight and wanted to shop for their wonderful Korean beauty products. We stayed at a hotel near Incheon and debated whether to take the AREX Incheon Airport Express train from the airport or uber. The one way train ticket was definitely cheaper at 9,000 South Korean won compared to the $75 USD uber but we opted for the uber due to time constraints. Taking the shuttle back to the airport, finding the express train, and coordinating the train schedule plus a transfer to Myeongdong Street from Seoul Station seemed too much of a hassle and time consuming. Travel time was between 45-60 minutes. Be prepared for the crowds since this was one of the main shopping/tourist streets. The stores accept credit cards but have SK won for the street vendors. We found ATMs in the area. We tried some of the street food but after awhile tired of the greasy fried food. There were some rather unique concoctions: fish shaped waffles, dumplings with red bean paste, and seasoned chicken/rice cakes to name a few. We were there for the beauty products and found Innisfree to have the best selections. We loved: Jeju orchid enriched cream, green tea seed serum, green tea seed eye cream, volcanic pore clay masks, wrinkle cream and of course the masks. The jellyfish vital mask was one of my favorites. Credit cards were accepted plus duty free was an option with a passport. These products can be ordered online but was cheaper in the stores. What was interesting about this area was that there were literally no garbage cans to throw away wrappers etc. from the street food. Fun experience and felt very safe in the area.","Written January 6, 2020"

There is so much here for everyone, in terms of beauty, music, niknaks, food etc. I would 100% recommend going here at night for the market, it is a once in a lifetime experience. The two best things I found in Myeongdong were - Nanta Theatre and Underground shopping centre.  The Nanta theatre was absolutely hilarious and can be loved by people of all ages. The underground shopping centre - found when going into the myeongdong subway station, was okay, there wasnt much there other than niknaks and socks, but there are a few kpop album shops there with such a large range of albums, all for very cheap. I'm from the UK and albums here (mainly bought through amazon) cost 4/5 times more than what I found here. I spent over £1000 on albums whilst here, and actually got my moneys worth, wheras in the UK this would have gotten me 30 albums at the most.","Written December 31, 2019"

The price can be diference betwen 3000 idr per item. Its all up to your decision.  I think 2.5 hours is not enough for first shopper like me. In the winter session, (-3 C) you must wear appropiate custom, since this is an outside area. And do not take more than 15 minute in the outside. visit a shop every 15 minute is the best to maintain your stamina.  There are alot of the same shop, so be careful if you make an appointment. be more specific on the location.  Take Care and have Fun.. happy shopping...

4.0,"During the day this is a street of cosmetics and young fashion, interesting enough and with plenty of restaurants of all Korean varieties with a couple of western ones as well. A labyrinthine network of little streets with shops and restaurants for all tastes. But in the evening it becomes a delight of impromptu stalls making and selling all sorts of Korean delicacies, fruit and drinks. Even some stalls selling costume jewelry and cosmetics. On a cold winter's evening when I was there, plenty of warming snacks and drinks. Not to be missed.","Written December 6, 2019"
5.0,"Sure, you can go during the day but at night this place truly comes alive, especially on weekends. About 3 blocks square, the food stalls congregate along one strip and it is on this strip that we spent most of our time as we are foodies. From live octopus to egg cake, fruit smoothies to scallops in large seashells, the choices are endless and a veritable taste sensation. Prices are reasonable to a tad pricey for what you get but where else can you have so much selection in such a condensed space.  We also had a Korean massage for a reasonable price but it is a dry massage through towels and a hospital-like gown; more of a pressure point session than a true massage... a bit of a disappointment.  The stores offer packaged almonds, dragon's beard candy, ice cream, face and beauty products, and numerous tourist trinkets. But really, it is all the neon and energy and liveliness in the crowds that make this place work. An hour will do or stay the whole evening; it's totally up to you. Also, as it is downtown it is walkable from anywhere in the tourist area and certainly a short walk to a bus or metro stop. Definitely go; one of our highlights. 5 stars.","Written December 5, 2019"
4.0,Love the street food in this place. There are a lot of variety compared to some markets. Slightly pricey for the food but quite standard throughout the street I.e. no need to look for best price or haggle.  It was quite crowded on a weekday night (wednesday) up to 930pm when we left. So can imagine it to be worse during weekends. There are also a lot of bulk discounts for cosmetics.  Even though you are not into cosmetics. Can just drop by to eat or soak into the atmosphere!,"Written December 5, 2019"

The variety of skin care brands and products is so wide but I did not buy anything. Mainly because I was not sure which ones are good and they all look the same to me. But if you are a big fan of Korean skin care, this may be a place to visit. Street food is nice but not fantastic. My overall experience is good. The place is vibrant and busy, the weather was cool and comfortable when I was there. I am not really a night market person but I really enjoyed my walk, looking at things and people.","Written October 23, 2019"
5.0,"Visited at night when the shopping street becomes a night market after a plethora of booths, almost all selling street food, are set up in the middle of the road.  Because the streets containing the market are wide, there is plenty of room to walk comfortably, without claustrophobia, having to push or being pushed. This gives Myeongdong night market an advantage over every other night market I’ve visited in Asia.  A further plus is the amazing variety of foodstuffs offered. As opposed to other similar markets in Asia you don’t have three, four, or ten merchants offering exactly the same food.  For those who like street food and/or night markets Myeongdong night market is very highly recommended.","Written October 22, 2019"

Also there are lots of clothing stores, restaurants, coffee shops and much much more. The stores close a little later at night so its a very fun street to walk day or night.

4.0,"With expectations set pretty high after watching loads of Youtube videos on this neighborhood, I was understandably left feeling 'eh' about it after getting a chance to experience this for a few days.  First off, I loved the vibe of the neighborhood, despite how crowded it became every night. That said, the neighborhood actually is not that big - two main thoroughfares, primarily, each maybe 4-5 blocks long. Lots of side streets with other shops and food options, but the main action really is on the thoroughfares. Lots of cosmetic shops, lots of cheap clothing of the Forever 21 quality level.  The street food was very much hit or miss, nothing completely mind blowing. Lots of repeat stands, but note that not all the stands have the same quality. I tried to use the length of the lines for each as a rough gauge on how good the stand may be - also a hit or miss approach.  Two tips and heads up (literally): - there are a lot of hidden eateries, cafes, and shops in all the buildings above ground level. really pay attention and look up to see what you may be missing out on! I found a few cafes that I loved - grab a coffee and a window seat and you can people watch all the action down below for awhile - garbage cans are really hard to come by. stay with the vendor you purchase food from and chuck your garbage with them after you're done, or come prepared","Written October 20, 2019"

One thing to note is that you'll see the same shops every 100-200 metres apart so if you're not looking for anything specific but are on a time crunch, I'd suggest visiting the bigger branches which should have everything. However if you're looking for specific Brands/products, you may have to visit different branches if brand/product isn't as popular.

I also found that if you spend over £30,000 won most of the shops would immediately deduct the tax free amount so no need to claim it separately. Take your passport with you.

4.0,"Myeongdong street is a shopping heaven, both for food, goods, and beauty products. It is clean and not rowdy, making it a safe place to roam around even at night. You have to try the street foods, they taste really yummy and cheaper than eating at a sit-down restaurant. You can have a good fill of delicious food just walking around while shopping. Beauty products are sold at stores left and right. You cannot go wrong as Korean beauty products are top of the line. It would be a mistake to come home without atleast buying one beauty product. As far as buying replicated goods on the street, it is not advisable to haggle down on the price as every vendor sells pretty much similar items in the same price. Don’t embarass yourself as they will just dismiss you or worse, you may end up being laughed at or given the dirty look.","Written September 8, 2019"

4.0,"I’m not fond of crowds and crazy shoppers; so Myeongdong’s beauty shopping mecca doesn’t really spell paradise for me. The only thing that draws me back would be its hardworking purveyors who spend their nights feeding hungry bellies, no matter the weather.  It’s important to note that Myeongdong’s street food are darn expensive. It’s something that definitely won’t fall under cheap eats; as you’ll usually be able to eat a hearty meal in a sit-down restaurant for the price of one or two of these street food finds.  There will never be a shortage of options in Myeongdong Night Market. The tricky part is though is how to strategize what to choose, given that you usually have to allot for queuing time and work with a limited budget and stomach. The Roast Lobster with Cheese (KRW 15000), for example, is an insanely indulgent treat, which serves grilled juicy lobster topped with a fluffy melted cheese blanket. It’s delicious, but it definitely won’t fill you up.  Baked seafood served with hot gooey melted cheese seems to be a popular trend (given that we arrived at the tail-end of its winter season), as kiosks of Cheese Butter Baked Scallops also drew in their own lines. The scallops were humongous; but tended to be overcooked.  The Shrimp King’s Grilled Shrimp (KRW6000) may be an uninspired choice compared to its flashier neighbors; but its perfectly cooked juicy shrimps were addicting. Its sweetness guarantees the freshness of the shrimps and makes them perfectly delicious to eat on their own. They do give you a variety of sauces and dips to play around with though!","Written August 11, 2019"

Come to COEX Mall just to see the library and you will understand what everyone is talking about! I loved seeing entire families sitting there together with books. I was amazed to see children off all ages, sitting in nooks against the window panes, reading. How wonderful of Korea to have inspired so many children to enjoy the simplicity of curling up with a good book. A real, actual book, not a tablet or a computer. A paper book to hold in their hands.

There is a large good court too. Also, a movie theatre and aquarium. Aquarium was very good on the other night. It closes at 8 pm with ticketing ending at 7.

4.0,"One of the interesting places to visit in Seoul is the COEX Mall.I would say don't miss it. The best way to get there from the city center, if you are taking the subway, is to take line 3(the orange line). Line 2(green line) will also take there, but line 3 takes less than 25 minutes.Take line 3 to Seoul university station and then take line 2 to Samseong station. Whenever you get out of the train look at the station and vicinity map posted on the platform to see the closest exit to the mall. As you enter the mall, make a right and you will see the information desk and a virtual interactive map of the layout of the mall.Check this out before you start exploring the place. Check the various restaurants and the food court before you decide to eat. Believe me, you wouldn't want to miss out on some of the best food in Seoul, all under one roof. Also check out the various retail shops, just browse, even if you don't buy anything, this would be an interesting experience. Once you are done with the mall, check out the area around the mall.

There are who stores and fashion stores and a lot of restaurants. There are high end shops but also bargain places like Daiso.

You’d find an area with food in one corner, walk for another 10 minutes and find another cluster of food stalls at another area. The signage/directions are rather confusing at times and the place is too big, it can be a pain if you are looking for a specific shop and realise you have to walk around 20 minutes just to get to it. The developers could have built more floors instead of having almost 95% of all the shops on the same level.

Spent 20 mins looking for a restaurant in the food court but it's not a traditional courtyard style food court. It's just restaurants almost along the same row. It gets even more confusing when you add the Oakwood arcade foodcourt into the mix.  The shops aren't really anything special either.

So big that it has two different KTX stops that bring you to its front doors.  It's more of an upscale mall with a great variety of popular Korean and foreign brands (Uniqlo, Roots, and some European designers are all I remember off the top of my head) as well as smaller boutique stores. Also being in a very developed area of Gangnam as well as being a destination in its own right, everything is a little bit more expensive here, especially compared to many of the other underground malls that have more stalls than built-out stores.  The food selection has a wide variety of prices and offerings so you'll find something you like for sure. The Seoul Aquarium and a movie theater are also in the mall if you're not much of the shopping type.  All in all, covering the whole mall would take about an hour of non-stop walking. While stopping in a few shops here and there, you can get through it in 2-3 hours. If you're like my girlfriend, well, you can spend the whole day here pretty easily.

When you're there, check out what conferences and exhibits are held--you may be lucky like us! We left because I was starving! There were so many restaurants to choose from in the mall. We saw an eyeglass shop and had heard that eyeglasses were reasonable in Korea, so, we checked it out and got some spiffy glasses as our souvenir! They were professional there, checking our eyes against our prescriptions and I was glad that we went there rather than a shop on the streets. The mall kept going on and on with an Aquarium, movie theatres, shopping, shopping and more shopping. We had planned to walk across the street to Bongeusa Temple for tea, but, we were tea'd out after that fabulous Tea Exhibit. We found our way back to our lockers using the well-marked signage, then, bought the Airport Limo Bus ticket (about $17 US each). The ride took a little over an hour and dropped us off on the 3rd floor at the airport where we could skip the long lines and go through the City Airport Transit line. Wonderful experience!","Written November 1, 2015"

The Hyundai department store is a must see. It's 11 stories and filled with high priced boutique stores. It's fun just for the experience.

At times I wasn't sure where I was going.  But, somehow the mall connected into the Hyundai Department Store. Since this is located in Gangnam, the first two floors are dedicated to luxury shopping. And I do mean ""high end"". This Hyundai Department Store is the best in Seoul! And they have a food court on the lower level.  Is the mall still worth going to..........it sure is.

And that's not even including the Hyundai department store. If you venture around to the bottom of the Hyundai department store, there are lots of bakeries selling awesome treats, a shop selling the best Korean mochi treats (dduk) that I have found in Seoul – including one with white cake crumbs which tastes like birthday cake that my whole family absolutely loves, a good wine shop and a cool place to find interesting kitchen items from around the world.  … so… if you're looking for a day to wander around aimlessly indoors… a place that will keep everyone in the whole family happy… yeah… give Coex a wander.

The first day I was overwhelmed with the commercialism, but then as the week wore on, the COEX mall became a friend providing warmth, sustinence and entertainment for me as a solo business traveler in a strange land.  HOLLYS COFFEE: Can't find it on the map, but it's worth a visit. I have never before had a Dutch Baby at a restaurant (they're a family favorite to make at a shindig) and it was good (not great). The coffee was very good, better to my palate than Star*ucks).  I also ate at Kervan one night, sushi for lunch, found some skin products at one store, and found groceries to stash in my hotel room at the Hyundai basement store.  The entertainment was watching the very young, very hip K-POP population meandering the mall in massive crowds at all times of day and night.  The surrounding area is not bad to walk, and had some nice sculptures. Quite urban, noisy, not really pedestrian-fun, but not unfriendly to walkers either.","Written May 3, 2015"

And I don't have time not energy to visit the more diverse shopping areas after work.  There are many retail shops; restaurants and cafes are plentiful too, but they don't come cheap, so be prepared to spend.  I was here during early spring when it can still be quite freezing at times, so shopping underground, staying indoor worked well for me.

Actually I'm Korean, and I live in the Samsung road(10 minutes by walk from COEX.)  My grade for Coex is 5stars, because there are many wonderful restaurants, and shops, and etc.  But not now.  From 2013, Coex mall is on a remodelling, so if you come here, you can use just 2 services.  First one is a mega box theater, and 2nd one is a aquarium.  I think, It's a terrible season for you to come here.  For me, I live in here so I go there to see a moive, but you don't have to see the movie here in Korea.  Instead of Coex mall,  I recommand you some sites.  1st one is 경복궁., which is a royal palace of CHOSUN dynasty.  You can see the Korean traditonal structures, and traditional clothes of royal family.  2nd is Insa-dong, where you can drink Korean-tea, and see the gallery.  3rd one is 동대문 시장, which is an cheap market for clothes, and sports equipments.  4th is 명동, the downtown of Seoul.  You can see the cathedral, and korean traditional market, and may complex marts.  I think, You can shop here, instead of Coex.  5th is 이태원, this is a road for foreigners. You can go by the subway line no.6, so It's very easy to find it.  There are may restaurants of western foods, and pub& clubs are in 이태원.  So I reccomend you to go there in the night.  Next is 삼청동.  It's a little bit expensive, but there are may beautiful cafes, and delicious Korean restuarants.  My last reccomendation is 여의도.  It's a little island, in the Han-river, and in 여의도, there is a nice river side park.  You can jog along the river.(Beer & Chicken will be a perfect selection. You can odrer by phone at the park.)  And for the restuarant,  I'll say just one thing.  Please stop by the 팔색삼겹살, in 신촌(sinchon).  It's very popular Korean pork bbq restuarant, and so many Japanese love this restaurant.  I believe that you'll be satisfied.  That's all.  I post this review,  just because I see so many foriegners in the Coex these days,  and everyone was dissapointed.

Armed with a map and the directions I got from the KTO website, I just followed it and emerged in front of a group of buildings that includes COEX MALL and World Trade Bldg. At the other end of the block, after a lot of walking (I was on my own DIY adventure with the map so I was looking like a lost little person), I found the Bongeunsa Temple on the other side of the street. The pedestrian lane connects Coex to the temple fronting each other. I wanted to see that temple where the Korean actor Lee Min Ho emerged from (particularly the Buddha Statue within the temple) in his KDrama 'Faith'. Going back, I ate lunch at Coex food court, found DunkinDonut for coffee.","Written July 23, 2013"

Megabox cineplex, the Aquarium, Lotte Duty Free and the big bookstore were still opened. There were only limited local dining options. Coex looked like a mall from the 80s.

The Coex Aquarium is on the bottom floor but there was a bad smell the day we went. Not sure if it was something to do with the aquarium or not but we did not end up going coz of the smell.  There is a very large bookstore/stationery shop in the centre of the mall which is great for book lovers!! There were show displays too! They were having a Samsung Galaxy Note event when we went and we just sat down and joined even though we didn't understand what they were saying.

If you are in the center of Seoul, like the Insadong or Myeongdong areas, take the number 3 subway line (orange) to Seoul National University of Education stop, and change for the number 2 line (green) and go to the Samseong station. The mall is connected to this station and the directions will lead you to the mall. The mall is underground from the Korean World Trade Center, and very large stretching for many blocks underground. Also located in this complex are the Intercontinental Hotel and the Park Hyatt Hotel. The mall has stores for all tastes from economical to luxury. There are a huge amount of restaurants from Western to Asian, and an Aquarium and the Kimchi Museum. The layout of the mall is relaxed with plenty of space and although there may be many people there, it never feels crowded. A worthwhile visit especially on a rainy day when you need something to do.

The mall opened at 1030 hrs, some stores did not open until 1100 hrs. I forgot the name of the coffee shop (Beans and something) located in the mall; the establishment has an enclosed area for smokers,pretty cool with automatic door (similar to the smoking room at Incheon airport).

In case you're craving for your usual fast food, this is definitely where you can get them. Some off the top of my head are Macdonalds and KFC. You can get almost anything in this mall, ranging from duty free shops, clothes, stationery, shoes, and so on.

You can find digital map at the mall entrances as well as along the mall. Remember to select the language you desire in order to read the map. The information desk and small stand along a few corners also have map in Japanese, Chinese, and English.  There are a few run of the mill restaurants in the COEX mall, as well as a few very elegent ones, all depends on ones mood. But be forewarned, if you go to COEX on a weekend or holiday, be prepared for long lines at any restaurant. I saw many locals grabbed a bite and the 7-11 inside the mall because the restaurants are too crowded.  The mall is very clean despite heavy traffic. Skip the kimchi museum because no one goes there (admission fee 3000w which is around $3). The food court inside the department store is very popular and worth a try.","Written July 23, 2012"

It has a respectable aquarium, an above average number of name brand franchises, a decent food court and a CGV movie theater. It also straddles the Samseong Station on Seoul Metro Line #2.  If you want an injection of weapons grade retail therapy then COEX will do the job.

3.0,I liked Deoksugung the least of Seouls five grand palaces Thats because its myriad buildings present a mishmash of neoclassical Western and traditional Korean architectural styles A palace since 1593 Deoksugung took on a new look in the early 1900s when King Gojong instituted a program of modernization and reform In addition during my October visit a wall enclosed a large portion of the grounds further detracting from a cohesive whole Construction work was under way with windows in the wall revealing only dirt and construction materials  I found the buildings interesting to look at separately especially Jeonggwanheon Hall a fusion of Western and Korean The king drank coffee here and entertained guests This small structure features a verandah and metal railings and fits in better with the Korean halls than with the massive Western buildings One of the latter now holds the Daehan Empire History Museum and another features the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art  I came here on a weekday to watch the changing of the guard at the entrance gate and stayed to visit the palace itself The guard ceremony proved to be absolutely spectacular with at least 50 participants dressed as Josenera soldiers and bandsman in vivid yellow or brilliant shades of purple The ceremony lasted about 10 minutes with a woman describing what was happening over a loudspeaker in English and other languages She then invited spectators to approach the soldiers to take photographs  Excellent free brochures about the palace are available in English Information signs most with details in English exist throughout the complex and tours are available in English The admission fee for adults is 1000 KRW about 1 US,"Written November 12, 2018"

5.0,Deoksugung has a different character compared to the other wellknown Korean palaces like Gyeongbukgung or Changdeokgung For me this is mostly because of the mix of Eastern buildings next to Western buildings which are greatly influenced by neoclassical architectural styles Deoksugung is also softer and feels less imposing than Gyeongbukgung possibly due to the less extensive grounds  I visited Deoksugung in the cherry blossom season and it was lovely especially in the sunset and as the lights started to come on Deoksugung is the only palace that is open until 9pm all year round allowing you the opportunity of walking in palace compound at twilight Its pretty amazing to feel that youve been transported back several hundred years only to look up and see a modern building or sign in the distance  If youre not fond of mingling with the tourist crowd but yet wanted to visit a Korean palace Deoksugung is ideal for its size location right next to City Hall and character,"Written May 15, 2017"

4.0,As I have done most of the palaces this one didnt have anything special no must see factor until I went round the Historical Museum This was the tick in the box for this Palace The w1000 also includes the museum and if you want to walk round head over as soon as you arrive and get yourself on a tour It is access by tour only and they leave every 30 minutes but gets full quick as the groups are only small Shoes off and slippers on they gave me an English audio so I could follow round but obviously the passionate guide was giving the locals much more than I was hearing All renovated in the last 10 years but decorated as best as they could from old photos and with some of the original furniture The history you get is the best thing and even some photos of the old emperors and emperoresses Your 1000 doesnt also get you into the art gallery that will cost you more,"Written February 4, 2017"

5.0,While this palace doesnt have the sprawling grounds of some of the others  it is stunning The lawns are so wellmanicured and the mixture of the architecture styles is quite interesting to see Some of the more European style buildings were constructed on the palace grounds during the Japanese occupation I believe there is also a small annex of the Seoul City Art Museum inside the grounds which holds small exhibitions I got to see a gorgeous collection of antique Cartier jewelry by chance in there one day Such a fun surprise I would say this palace is a must see,"Written January 18, 2017"
4.0,Being the smallest one among the four palaces I got to in Seoul not sure how it compares in size with Gyeonghuigung which is the only one that I didnt get to among Seouls five palaces this is not a palace like Gyeongbokgung which is kind of a world of its own with its huge grounds where youll get an immersion experience of the Joseon era days but what this palace offers just because of its significantly smaller grounds compared to Gyeongbokgung is nice contrasting views of traditional palace buildings  their modern highrise counterparts right outside the confines of the palace grounds including the interestingshaped allglass structure of Seoul City Hall which can be seen from the raised platform around the main palace building which will kind of give you an idea how far Korea has come from those days of the Joseon Dynasty And those relatively small grounds of the Palace actually merge on one side to the left of the main palace building while facing it or equivalently to your right if you go all the way to the end of the pathway from the entrance gate after coming in from the street with the grounds of a big museum with a lovely fountain in front although Im not sure if the museum is considered part of the Palace for admission purposes or if it can be entered from another side  And unlike at the other palaces the main building of this palace can be entered not just to look at from right outside so you can get a closeup view of the throne stage Also present here at the entrance gate are two or three ceremonial guards didnt see them on the way in at about 10 am though only saw them on the way out about an hour later but Im sure theres no big ceremony involving a lot of guardsmen in colorful attires with some holding beautiful flags as at Gyeongbokgung since theres simply no space here for such a ceremony  Coming by subway City Hall Station Lines 1  2 is where to get off and youre pretty much right outside the Palace once you get out of the station onto the big street Sejong Daero just a 1to2minute walk to the entrance gate And what I suggest for the ticket is getting an integrated ticket for 10000 won the equivalent of 10 US dollars which is good for like a month and which gives you admission to four of Seouls five palaces except for Gyeonghuigung which Im sure is a small one maybe even smaller than this one  Jongmyo Shrine; also do keep in mind that this palace along with Changdeokgung  Changgyeonggung are closed on Mondays whereas the main palace Gyeongbokgung  Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays,"Written January 17, 2017"

3.0,This palace is within walking distance from the City Hall Station Had I not visited Gyeongbokgung the next day I would have rated it very good Somehow the modern cityscape surrounding the palace ground spoils the flavor of the traditional palace architectures  The Royal Guards changing ceremony is a must watch if you do not plan to go to Gyeongbokgung Do check out the schedule in advance so that you can optimize your time Be at the entrance before time so that you can watch from a good spot The schedules during our visit in the last week of Oct15 were 11 am 2 pm and 330 pm The ceremony last for 30 minutes and I found it a bit lengthy at the end The colourful costumes of the Royal Guards make some of the otherwise plain photos stand out  It is also worth to pay a visit to the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art which is also inside the palace compound If youre here at the right time during autumn which we obviously were not you should be able to see a blaze of vibrant autumn colours,"Written January 2, 2016"

5.0,My aunt and I came upon this little place by accident we were actually trying to catch the metro for another palace The interesting thing about this palace is that its remains lie across the street from Seoul City Hall where there is always a concert or market or something going on When you walk in the palace itself is just beyond the trees and paths of greenery The designs of the palace itself are those that one sees in all the palaces flowers with bright colors and repetition of all the designs As you walk further into the area you come across a museum of art which is separated from the palace by a little pond with a fountain The hustle and bustle of the street and city beyond the palace walls all but disappears Its crazy to have the two contrasts of old meets new in this small area,"Written August 28, 2015"

4.0,According to various online resources visitkoreaorg the palace booklet etc you name it Deoksugung Palace was originally belonged to Wolsandaegun 14541488 the older brother of King Seongjong 14691494 of the Joseon Dynasty It became a proper palace when Gwanghaegun 15751641 ascended the throne and gave the palace the name Gyeongungung in 1611 Afterwards the name was then changed back to its original title of Deoksugung  Visitors can enjoy watching the ceremony of the changing of royal guards at 1100 1400 1530 It takes about 10 minutes to finish the show Personally I prefer the Gyeongbok Palaces ceremony better as the compound is bigger over there and the result of the pictures taken there came out way nicer  One interesting building within the palace is the Jeonggwanheon Pavilion  \xe9\x9d\x9c\xe8\xa7\x80\xe8\xbb\x92 Literally the name means \xe2\x80\x9cPalace from which to watch the garden silently\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a very zenlike name This building was renovated and reopened in 2006 It was the first western style building built in the palace in 1900 Widely known as the Kings Lounge it is said to be a place for the King Go Jong to enjoy coffee and snacks and hold various banquets here Influenced by the western culture and lifestyle Go Jong enjoyed drinking coffee and spending his leisure time here The back of the building had secret passageways to the Russian Emissary which still exist today  for more reviews check httppheurontaycomdeoksugungpalaceseoul,"Written July 19, 2014"

4.0,Liked this palace  smaller more interesting layout and of course the impressive changing of the guard ceremony It also lies aside the new modern Western residence that the last King built in the early 1900s which we were told will be open to the public probably October this year What makes this palace so intersting is that mix of old and new What was once the garage is now a cafe This coffee habit started life in the Jeonggwanheon Hall where the King drunk his beloved brew  but got poisoned  which supposedly stopped him producing any heirs Great modern stories mixed in with the old history The changing of the guard ceremony a bit staged and a tiny bit off putting when you can see the velcro and the odd Nike trainer on the soldiers None the less a good spectacle and an even better photo opportunity,"Written July 3, 2014"
3.0,Since our kids are not really big fans of palace tours we opted to just time our visit to the Changing of the guards Its a delight to watch as we were almost brought back in time with the display of guards in uniforms marching in front of the palace gates There is also a tent across the gate which lends traditional Korean clothes to visitors Photos can be taken with the guards after the ceremony,"Written June 19, 2014"
3.0,A beautiful place to sit back and relax but if you are after Temples and dont have much time in seoul I would not suggest this to be the best out of the lot  Its a nice place to have a cold drink and read a book this temple is included in the 5 palaces in one ticket,"Written June 10, 2014"

5.0,Following our visit to Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung we had some time to visit Deoksugung The history of this palace is covered extensively elsewhere and all the practical information required is in the excellent KTO page httpenglishvisitkoreaorkrenuSISI_EN_3_1_1_1jspcid264316  We bought an Integrated Ticket of Palaces which covers Changdeokgung Changgyeonggung Deoksugung Gyeongbokgung and Jongmyo Shrine This was excellent value at 10000 won  After the history lessons at the first two much larger palaces we did not join a tour as the palace is small enough to wander around independently with notes from your guidebook It is situated in delightful gardens with many seats dotted around so you can bring a picnic or rest your weary feet if you have been shopping too much in the nearby area  There is also a Changing of the Guards ceremony at this palace and the National Museum of Contemporary Art is in the same compound  Although this palace is not as big as Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung I gave it a five star rating because of its convenient location right in the centre of a shopping area which means you can just pop in for a quick visit and get some history and culture along with some art as well,"Written April 23, 2014"
4.0,Small in size compared to the big and famous gyeongbokgung palace Situated right next to the city hall metro station Very convenient to reach Had the modern art exhibition when I visited But the guard changing ceremony is not to be missed In fact can be better appreciated here as crowd is less If you reach early can take photographs with the royal guards Very friendly But the palace complex itself is small in size and some parts are under renovation hence closed But can spend few hours here,"Written April 13, 2014"

4.0,Would highly recommend the changing of the guard ceremony in front of the entrance particularly if you have kids Guards and soldiers are dressed in full traditional costumes and regalia with traditional music playing the background  In the middle of the ceremony the audience is invited to take pictures with the soldiers  I saw tourists in traditional costumes  I think there is a tent near the front providing costumes to add to the experience  The palace grounds are well presented we had the extra bonus if cherry blossoms with the palace buildings here and there along the grounds We found an hour was sufficient to walk around,"Written April 10, 2014"
5.0,Situated in the center of the city right at the subway exit Not a very big one which makes it a good choice when you dont have much time but still want to do some sightseeing Entrance is only 1 but theres additional charge for entering the museum located inside Pretty crowded among netizens during lunch time Make sure to check the schedule of changing guards ceremony outside the main gate,"Written March 3, 2014"
5.0,While changing guard ceremony is a must see and free at the palace gate you can be part of it by registering at the tent in front of the gate There are also many clothes to lent to visitors to have a taste of traditional costumes men women kids Looks like we are travelled back in time contrasted with the surrounding skyscrappers I was invited to be in full dress and hit the drum as part of the ceremony A white guy looked at me in full guard costume with envy or not If you found it too cold to stand in the wind there is a cafe in wall glass and chairs facing the gate,"Written February 24, 2014"
4.0,Nice palace with a variety of architecture to include Korean mixed Korean architecture designed by Russian architecture western style buildings They had some interactive games and the kids enjoyed playing the one that they played We watched the changing of the guard which is scheduled at various times and occurs at the front gate This palace had a nice thrown room that you could go in which was unique If you only have a chance to visit one palace then I would go to one of the others as there are multiple palaces in Seoul such as Gyeongbokgung but if you have time or are going to be in Seoul for awhile then this is a nice visit It only took a few hours Fee is reasonable as we have found most of them to be in Seoul,"Written February 2, 2014"
4.0,We visited this palace at night which was very interesting to see all the buildings lit up The grounds are not as extensive as the other palaces so if you can only choose one or two to visit I wouldnt pick this one but if you have time to see them all this one is worth a visit I think this palace is interesting because of its proximity to so many modern buildings history meets the city,"Written February 1, 2014"
4.0,It was a truly unique experience to watch the elaborated change of guards ceremony in front of Deoksugung Palace it was like a walk into history The ceremony happens three times a day at 11am 2pm and 330pm Traditional Korean outfits or better known as habok could be borrowed for picturetaking with the guards after the ceremony  The palace itself is surrounded by the busy urban traffic located just above City Hall Subway Station opposite Seoul Plaza Within the ancient walls you will find old Korean palaces and westernstyle buildings forming a stark contrast against the modern skyscrapers of Seoul The charm of the past the beautifully lined trees and the serenity of the palace ground is enchanting Just be sure not to visit on Monday because its closed  If you are visiting during winter drop by the iceskating rink opposite the entrance of Deoksugung and have fun doing one of the Koreans favorite winter sport for as little as 1000KRW,"Written January 20, 2014"

4.0,Deoksugung is one of the four palaces in Seoul and it may be the easier one to access right next to City Hall There is a small entrance fee KRW 1000 I think but it is worth it as you can freely wonder in the park and around buildings with skyscrapers in the background There is also a Museum within the complex at the back where it is possible to view Korean artwork for the early 20th century for an extra fee There is also a caf\xc3\xa9 with a souvenir shop on the grounds  There is also a changing of guard ceremony at the entrance three times per day which is worth watching for traditional costumes and music If you can only see one palace make it this one,"Written January 5, 2014"
4.0,It was a unique experience visiting the palace surrounded by the busy city life and traffic Within the walls you witness the old palace in its time The trees were beautiful lining the walk towards the grand palace  While the palace was smaller compared to the Chinese palaces it doesnt loose its grandeur  Best visit in Autumn to witness the foliage of the ginkgo and maple trees  The change of guard is elaborate and not to be missed Check the schedules  Dont miss this,"Written January 2, 2014"

5.0,What a pleasant surprise tucked next to City Hall an elaborate and accessible Changing Of The Guards ceremony apparently running all the time; very inexpensive ticket price; immaculately restored and kept grounds and buildings all in a compact space Perfect for the tourist with limited time this gives a reasonable idea of the architecture and style of the glory days of Korea just as the Japanese were taking over There is a constant delicious juxtaposition of the spacious grounds surrounded by the totems of modern life shopping malls and skyscrapers Unlike the much bigger Gyeongbokgung palace where one may feel at times transported to the 17th century at the DeoksuGung you always see the context  the value Korea places on its history and its future both A further plus is the National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art tucked in the back of the grounds like a forgotten relative Quite tame and not really very modern the museum is now showing Masterpieces of Modern Korean Painting an interesting set of tableaux clearly designed for a Koreanlanguage audience Still its worth a visit,"Written December 30, 2013"

5.0,Of all the changings of the guard the one at Deoksugung Palace is the only one that felt personal At this location the changing of the guard is close enough to reach out and touch the guards you can feel the drumbeat and you can take photos with them after the ceremony As a photographer this allows for some wonderful closeup photos If you are going to choose one Changing of the Guard ceremony Deoksugung Palace is the one  The Palace itself is interesting but fell third behind Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace for us One of the Five Grand Palaces of the Joseon Dynasty Deoksugung Palace however is unique in that it offers the only example of a palace built in western style Seokjojeon and the first western style built in Korea The juxtaposition of ancient old and the very modern surroundings is fascinating and disconcerting all at once  Well worth the nominal admission price the best part of our visit to Deoksugung Palace was the ChangingoftheGuard Ceremony outside the main gates a free attraction and one of my favorite in Seoul,"Written November 9, 2013"

4.0,Deoksugung literally means the Palace of Virtue and Longevity in Korean or Chinese It is not well known that the Chinese was very much the official language in Korea although King Sejong created the Korean scripts in the late 15th century  I will mention the modern dimension first The place is near the City Hall One building houses the national museum of art which is not worthy its great name but holds special exhibitions I was impressed by a modern Korean painter who adopted Western techniques in his paintings Also Western style was introduced into the architecture and landscape in the compound  Without knowing the history one will not find the palace particularly interesting So let me add a historical flavor This place was used as royal places twice First was during the Korean resistance to the Japanese invasion at the end of the 16th century Since all others palaces were burned this place served as royal palace for a while It became a royal palace again after King Gojong ended his yearlong refuge in the Russian embassy in 1907 Gojong ascended the throne at the young age in 1863 and was under the influence or control of his father and later his wife He declared himself an emperor but was forced by Japanese to abdicate the throne to his son the last emperor His death and Wilsons 14 Points in January 1919 triggered the March First Movement which aimed at Korean independence,"Written August 1, 2013"

3.0,This is probably the most accessible palace in its proximity to Seoul city hall but the alterations to it during the long Japanese occupation gives you the impression that this of the three major palaces within Seoul is the most affected A multiple palace entry ticket is good value though palace entry is generally quite cheap and this palace is included There is probably little point in visiting this palace too if you are seeing the major palaces to the north,"Written July 4, 2013"

5.0,There are many palaces in Seoul and unless you are spending a long period of time there impossible to visit all so I chose 2 that I thought would have colorful changing of guards ceremonies and I was not disappointed with Deoksugung The Palace is located on the main street of Sejong and more importantly right across the street from Seoul City Hall and Seoul Park You can take the number 1 train green line or the number 2 train dark blue line and get off at the city hall stop Take exit 2 or 3 from the station and once thru the turnstiles look for and elevator It will let you off at street level directly in front of the Palace Check for the times of the changing of the guards but they are listed at 1100 200 and 330 It seems it may be more frequent as I was in that area a number of times for other attractions and it always seemed to be going on Position your self more to the left of the entrance as the procession enters from the stoned and brick side street to the left of the Palace especially if you want to take pics I videoed the ceremony with my Ipad and the pics were great This is a must for any visit to Seoul something that friends and family back home will appreciate Not something you see everyday The grounds of the Palace are spacious and clean but looks barren The day we visited the Museum and another building were closed for renovations and there were very few people on the grounds There are many trees offering shade if a warm day and a teacoffee house toward the back with tables and chairs outside It was just peaceful to sit and look around at all the history and culture of Korean royalty There are a number of buildings to view although the landscaped grounds were not as beautiful as Gyeongbokgung,"Written December 7, 2012"

5.0,Deoksugung is important for two reasons it become a royal palace following the Imjin War and was breifly the primary palace until Changdeokgung was rebuilt in the early 17th century Second near the twilight of the Joseon dynasty Emperor Gojong used the palace as a refuge after the brutal murder of his wife  The palace itself consists of roughly 13 of the structures that once stood within the complex The palace is not as beautiful and wellpreserved as Changdeokgung Palace nor as grand as the largely rebuilt Gyeonbokgung Palace Yet I really enjoyed my visit for both the history and pleasant atmosphere within the palace grounds There is one unique feature of Deoksugung the European style palace structure that stands out rather prominantly  For those interested in Seouls dynastic past the first palace you should visit is Changdeokgung the second should be Deoksugung,"Written November 28, 2012"

3.0,My wife and I visited Deoksugung Palace one icy cold afternoon It was in walking distance from our hotel in Myeongdong although I later learned that it was also just one station away The palace is probably the smallest or one of the smaller in Seoul but we found it romantic The grounds were very spacious and full of trees and the architecture was colourful as with other palaces Not much to see to be honest other than a few palace buildings and the changing of the guard ceremony But there is an museam inside the palace ground that provided interesting viewing and respite from the freezing cold There is also a lovely walk around the outer walls of the palace that we thoroughly enjoyed During that walk we had a fantastic lunch at the organic restaurant that is located at the theatre If you time your visit to the palace well you can follow it up with this walk late lunch at the restaurant and a theatre show So Deoksugung is okay on its own but great and conveniently fitted in as part of a walk of the area Do it,"Written July 11, 2012"
5.0,Deoksugung Palace as has been said in other reviews is one of the smaller palaces in Seoul But it isnt any less of an experience to visit By having relatively smaller grounds you can walk the entire complex in an hour to an hour and a half seeing all the beautiful architecture from Koreas history But take some time to really experience the surroundings and stroll through the grounds featuring beautifully kept open spaces gardens and walking trails alongside the stunning buildings It was quiet and peaceful even as more visitors arrived we went around 10am The Museum of Art located within the Palace grounds is also another great plus of visiting here  But the main attraction was definitely the Changing of the Guards ceremony The colors and the sounds from the likely hundred or two individuals acting out the ceremony are a musthave experience when visiting Seoul After the ceremony the guards and royal officials remain outside the Palace for you to take photos with them A highlight of the experience is the opportunity for you to dress up in traditional Korean clothing for free A tip dress up before taking photos with the guards Makes your souvenir photos that more special,"Written July 8, 2012"

5.0,There are three great cultures in East Asia Chinese Korean and Japanese For at least the last two millennia Chinese cultural influences radiated out to both Korea and via Korea to Japan Westerners sometimes dismiss Korean art as imitative but thats not true You might as well dismiss Italian Renaissance painting as simply imitative of Flemish or Romanesque architecture as simply imitative of Roman Each of the Far Eastern national arts is unique and excellent But I suspect even those with a strong interest in art and culture are far more familiar with Chinese and Japanese than Korean So in terms of delving into artistic and cultural terra incognita we Westerners would get more bang for the buck in the National Museum of Korea than in either the Imperial Palace Museum in Taipei or the National Museum in Tokyo All three of these museums are overwhelming but Koreas fine arts are the ones most likely to be a terra nova  You could spend a full day at this museum standing in line when the doors open and being ordered out when they close and still not absorb it all I was astonished to see TAs suggested duration as \xe2\x80\x9c2 to 3 hours\xe2\x80\x9d but felt better when I checked and saw their suggested duration for the British Museum was also \xe2\x80\x9c2 to 3 hours\xe2\x80\x9d In fact cheer up curators of the NMK TAs suggested duration for the Louvre is \xe2\x80\x9c 1 hour\xe2\x80\x9d The curatorship of the NMK by the way is as outstanding as its collection which was good news for me I needed all the help I could get Here are just a few things Id recommend you look for  Plug Em and Pot Em We do a lot of odd things to our dead Egyptians mummified them; so did Chileans Zoroastrians put them out for the buzzards to eat; so did Thais long ago Eating them was the norm in New Guinea New Zealand and the Amazon But as you wander through the NMKs collection of Three Kingdoms artifacts 4th5th century CE be on the lookout for some huge red clay pots Baekje honoured their noblest dead by jarring them My mother used to preserve stuff in jars too but it was apples and apricots not ancestors See Burial Jars photo  A Really Old Boat The bestknown boat surviving from antiquity is the Khufu boat which has an entire museum to itself a baseballs throw from the Sphinx in Gaza Its over 4000 years old and remarkably wellpreserved but was built strictly for mortuary purposes and never even got wet The NMKs got a real boat thats twice as old 8000 not 4000 You get to see what little remains of it and a recreation A humble canoe; no Pharaoh would have dreamed of stepping into it but it would be thousands of years later before Pharaohs were even invented Im not sure wed even gotten to antiquity yet when some stoneage Korean carved this canoe Korean fauna back then included cave lions and woolly mammoths I suspect the canoe hit a rock got holed and was abandoned by its owner as a nowworthless piece of junk Little did he know that people would line up and pay good money to see it 8000 years later see Neolithic Canoe photo  Buddhas Explained Naturally the NMK has a large collection of ancient Buddhas Ive mentioned the NMKs outstanding curatorship I particularly commend them here Ive been to national museums in China Japan and every country in Southeast Asia and this is the first museum Ive seen seen that explains each and every mudra Whether theyre giant Buddhas or miniatures all Buddhas do something with their hands Each hand gesture has a specific meaning but if you dont know Buddhist signlanguage you cant read them The NMK provides you with an easy 10minute course on what each one of them means immeasurably improving your understanding and appreciation of what youre seeing After six years of wandering around Asia I knew a few of them but now I know five times more A healing Buddha holds a medicine ball in his left hand and not only heals folks but saves them from calamities in both Pure Land or Theraveda Buddhism the \xe2\x80\x9cgoddess of mercy\xe2\x80\x9d Guanyin does the same and she also holds a bottle of medicine see Healing Buddha A different gesture indicates that the Buddha is dividing his disciples into nine different grades depending on their religious capacity see GradeMaking Buddha The star of the collection however is a pensive Bodhisattva one of the National Treasures of Korea see Pensive Bodhisattva The museums also got a brilliant 5minute video on the building of one of the UNESCO world heritage site Buddhist temples in south Korea broken capstone and all Every NMK video is worth watching  Other National Treasures Korea has an admirable system for identifying its finest cultural treasures Youll find quite a few of them in this museum National Treasure 61 NT 61 is a 12th century dragonshaped celadon ewer see Celadon Dragon; NT 191 is a golden \xe2\x80\x9cantler helmet\xe2\x80\x9d and girdle see Antler and Girdle Other NTs run the gamut from NT86 a towering ceramic pagoda that you cant possibly miss see Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda to NT 89 a belt buckle that you could easily miss but hopefully wont its made of over 50 grams of pure gold thread and granules shaped into a large twisting dragon surrounded by half a dozen smaller ones see Gold Belt Buckle I used to have a belt buckle just like that myself in my dreams Be on the lookout for anything in the museum with an NT designation  I could have spent several days in this museum Spending only one I focused almost entirely on the Korean collections However the museum has important collections from other cultures including Gandhara and Pala Two items that definitely caught my eye were a bronze Greek helmet and a small but ornate Malay basin small because it was used to give newborn babies their first scrub see Greek Helmet and Malay Neonate Basin If youve an interest in Chinese celadon dont miss the the Sinon Shipwreck Collection This notquitehardyenough ancient freighter was headed to Japan in the 1320s ran afoul of a typhoon or faulty navigation and wound up at the bottom of the sea off the coast of Korea 1323 was at the tailend of the Mongol dynasty they went through seven emperors during that decade each one worse that his predecessor but China was still making firstrate china Hence a treasuretrove of Chinese celadon from as far afield as Canton being glazed thousands of pieces were in pristine condition Personally Id rate Sung celadon 1 Tang porcelain 2 and Ming 3 but a shipfull of any Chinese celadon is a treasuretrove indeed with a thousand pieces of metalware as a little something extra see Sinon 1 Sinon 2 Sinon 3 and Sinon 4 photos  If you want to take a break the museum has both a excellent teahouse and a restaurant Be aware that if you order anything with \xe2\x80\x9cspicy\xe2\x80\x9d in its name such as \xe2\x80\x9cspicy beef soup with black tigers paw mushrooms\xe2\x80\x9d it may be hotterthanHades spicy even by South Louisiana Cajun standards see Spicy photo Also note that the grounds around the museum are wellworth a stroll with bridges and pavilions gardens and carp ponds see Museum Gardens photo  As with any other major world museum what you bring to it will reflect what you take away from it If you can do the Louvre in under an hour 2 or 3 hours here will certainly suffice If youve got young children the odds are that that hall after hall of glazed porcelain will make their eyes glaze over But for visitors with a real interest in Asian culture and art Id recommend getting there when the doors open and sticking to it until they close But then Id recommend spending a whole day at the Louvre too,"Written September 3, 2019"

4.0,This museum is my favorite museum in Seoul with a vast array of artifacts ranging from ancient times to the era of the Korean War The museum is educational for learning about the history of Korea something which is mostly ignored in Western education Many of the rooms are not filled to capacity but the museum is spread out enough that there is plenty to see The top floor has exhibits on Asian history in general encompassing more than just KoreaI found these more interesting There is also a large quantity of pottery and calligraphy throughout the museum Admission is free and while an audio guide is recommended I found it cumbersome and unnecessary Many of the items have English labels and an English map is available,"Written June 18, 2018"
4.0,The museum offers a decent download of the history of Korea till the formation of modern Korea Sadly you wouldnt get to see anything like the impact of World War Alot of stuff are touch and go but that is understandable because Seoul also hosts many other related museum such as the National Palace Museum of Korea As an arsent museum goer it is just a pity that this museum is not a one stop shop  The key exhibits are in the first floor The 2nd and 3rd floors houses some arts pieces of Korea and artifacts of the world respectively I personally think that you may give these 2 upper floors a miss it time is a constraint  I can see effort in the curation but the collection especially on general world is quite thin  I spent a total of 45 hrs in the museum Entrance is free,"Written June 18, 2018"

4.0,The National Museum of Korea is connected to the Ichon Station Line 4 and a comfortable walk both to the museum and within the museum While it is a big location with multiple artefacts to keep you occupied I will first warn that most of the permanent exhibits are of art and archaeological digs making the museum cover more about what Korea was hundredsthousands of years ago more so than what South Korea is now If that is what you want to see then the Museum is a great place to be in otherwise I suggest you take the time to explore Seouls other museumsdistricts which would talk more about peoples present lives  Otherwise its free and an appropriate location for wet weather There are also special exhibitions you can pay for and the National Hangeul Museum in close vicinity so you can easily spend a few hours here,"Written May 30, 2018"

5.0,I visited the National Museum on my own while on a family vacation This is an expansive complex that is impressive in its own right Space is scarce in Seoul so experiencing the landscaped grounds and the massive building itself is already notable This is a good break from much of Seouls commercialism and it is a good way to spend a cold or rainy day The main museum would not be fun for kids; its geared for high school students at a minimum  Getting there You can get there from the Ichon Station on the Seoul Metro 4 line This line is convenient because it also runs through Seoul Station and Myeongdong You need to travel some distance from the stop itself through two moving walkways and up weaving stairs Its possible to travel the entire distance on wheelchair but if you have trouble walking it is quite a trek  First Floor If you go through the first floor by beginning on the right side as you enter and proceeding counterclockwise the exhibit will unfold chronologically from prehistoric times to the beginning of the 20th century As an American its impossible to see Korean history in such quantity at one time Its quite a treat  Special Exhibit I was able to see a very manageable but very informative exhibit of the muchoverlooked Baekje Kingdom which goes through the end of January 2017  2nd and 3rd Floors consist of donated works calligraphypainting Asian art and sculpturecrafts I did not see these floors  Building The building itself is extremely large Others have commented that the museum feels relatively empty To me this is a plus Visitors can explore at their own pace and dont have to worry about being swept up in the crowds  English language There are a few English language tours an English language map and an audio guide which I did not use Each major section has a good English introduction and most artifacts have at least an English label,"Written December 30, 2016"

4.0,I spent four or five hours engrossed in the many exhibits A good way to spend a wet day The galleries are arranged by the periods in Korean history from the paleolithic to the Joseon dynasty and is an excellent introduction to the countrys story  I felt however that the museum could have had more to say about Koreas interaction with its neighbours through the centuries  trade cultural etc  and about the modern period including the years under Japanese rule  Then again better not as the museum seems to maintain a somewhat nationalistic tone  There is a food court within with reasonably priced dishes  The museum is easily reached by metro Get off at Ichon station light blue line and follow the signs from there,"Written December 18, 2016"

5.0,We spent 212 hours at the museum with our day tour guide who gave us a wonderful overview of some of the major exhibits To do it justice would take 23 days On entering the incredible building one is immediately attracted to the 10 story Gyeongcheonsa Pagoda at the end of the main hallway Constructed in 1340 from marble rather than granite the pagoda is a Korean national treasure It was stolen and shipped to Japan in 1907 but was returned in the 1960s after international pressure on the Japanese government Also a must see are the various Buddhas and other historical artifacts that have amazing detail and workmanship The museum was busy with many young students observing and making notes but at no time did it feel crowded because of its spaciousness We also noted that the students were taking their excursion very seriously and well mannered On leaving the Museum we were pleasantly surprised that we were engaged in English by a small group of teenage students who wanted to try their language skills The students were extremely polite and we had a pleasant conversation until we parted ways in the coach parking lot We enjoyed the contact and the students seemed to as well,"Written November 19, 2016"

4.0,As with all my reviews to sights in Seoul I will preface this by advising visitors to carefully check opening days and times and whether timed entry tickets are needed to access certain parts of the attraction and also the times for booking guided tours in their language of preference \xe2\x80\x93 bearing in mind that numbers can be limited  The reviews here are a little mixed And I think the reason is that sometimes a building is better than the artefacts it is designed to accommodate Not to denigrate the artefacts as many are fine objects in their own right and have historical and cultural significance for Korea  The approach to the building engenders a sense of expectation A wide open air stair case frames a panorama of north Seoul with the iconic Naksam Tower as a central focus in the distant horizon  Inside the cathedral like space is immense with the entrance being a spectacular rotunda formation soaring to a great height The sense of space is exaggerated by use of simple finishes with creamwhite marble and stone walls and floors The entire building is an outstanding example of public architecture on a grand scale  Visitor amenities are excellent Outside there are pleasant grounds which the hordes of visitors use for picnics and leisure  When I visited there were numerous school parties dashing around trying to complete their Ispy books  they were noisy and intrusive  taking away some of the pleasure of the experience  Public transport access is easy from the nearby Metro Station,"Written October 10, 2016"
5.0,I have visited many museums and to be honest after a while they tend to become a blur This one did not and I think that this was largely due to our English speaking tour guide you have to book when you enter the museum I learned so much The childrens part is the usual hands on dress up offered,"Written October 7, 2016"

3.0,The museum building and grounds are very pretty and has its own train station  The first floor inside is the most interesting part in terms of history everything else is for art lovers I guess and people who can appreciate ceramics Would be great if they had more exhibits like maybe what prehistoric animals  dinosaurs they had in Korea  If you had to choose between this and the war museum go to the war museum Wouldnt spend too long here,"Written September 28, 2016"
5.0,Very interesting building in its own right The collections are very well organized especially if one is not too familiar with the very long history of Korea The building is large and spacious so it takes some time to go through it even if one does not read everything We signed up for the tour with one of the English speaking docentsguides She was very informative and pointed to the exceptional pieces whether for their historical or artistic significance,"Written September 23, 2016"

3.0,Im always excited with the prospect of visiting a museum or any other informal learning institution for the first time There is a tingling sense of anticipation when you first see the building from a distance and as you walk up to the lobby you begin to visualise the wonders to be experienced within The National Museum of Korea was no different except that the walk to the entrance was so long that by the time I reached the building itself after being deposited at the main road by bus I was physically spent  To call the museum sprawling is an understatement Its a massive footprint and ranks among the top ten largest museums in the world Just walking from point to point including within the building will take you hours Though I never expect to finish a museum experience in one visit or however many since the experience always evolves the National Museum of Korea is particularly draining although there are some gems in the expansive collection  Its worth noting that the outdoor experience is worth checking out too but I did wished for more leisure friendly facilities like an affordable cafe Theres enough seating and water dispensers but the restaurants I stumbled on were a little pricey including the premium gift shop However I didnt have a chance to fully experience every area so perhaps I may have missed some of the facilities I was looking for  In general the museum is free to visit but special galleries may have additional charges Theres a childrens museum and the main museum consists of significant permanent galleries with changing ones too Its not too far out from downtown Seoul took me around 30 minutes by tour bus and I believe its also accessible by train do check the website The museum is somewhat sterile inside  hushed not too welcoming and ohso serious but well it is a national museum after all Even though there are lots I missed in my half day visit I really wouldnt need to go back,"Written September 8, 2013"

5.0,The building itself is very imposing and the collection inside is truly of national standard The various provincial museums of which I visited several in five weeks in Korea pale in comparison and a visit here almost saves you the bother The collection of porcelain especially celadon is very fine and rivals something like the Shanghai Museum but in a narrower field There are many things like recovered tumuli treasures which are appropriately presented here in the National Museum although also elsewhere Some of the donor collections tend to be fairly narrow roof tiles etc but nevertheless valuable for their dept Unmissable if you visit Seoul but not on the handiest subway line,"Written July 11, 2012"

4.0,This is a big complex so give yourself plenty of time to visit The buildings are situated in a lovely park area refreshments are available in a cafe We used the audio only guide in English but we think the audio plus visual would have been better The exhibits are good lots of English and the audio was very informative Learnt a lot about Korean history As the museum is a far distance from the centre it is located close to a train stationbut taxis in Seoul very cheap so both methods of transport good to use,"Written July 6, 2012"
4.0,The architecture is as fascinating as the exhibits and the museum is laid out very well allowing you to move through time periods sequentially The permanent displays are free and there are food facilities inside and outside One down point  there doesnt seem to be the same peaceful museum etiquette in Korea as there is in the West So expect loud adults and children alike the sound echoing around the halls with the curators doing nothing about it,"Written July 6, 2012"

4.0,It definitely is the National Museum of Korea with relevant displays and exhibits but it is rather lackluster unless you are really fascinated with Korean Culture It is quite big and spacious and the outside of the museum is almost like a park where you can just enjoy a stroll along the pond during the late afternoon  I recommend taking advantage of the free museum guides who volunteer at certain times of the day rather than spending your money on those audio guides unless you really want to,"Written June 4, 2012"
5.0,The museum was very huge and there were a lots of exihibits Those were not only from Korea but also from many Asian region Those are very interesting and I learned much about Asian history When I visited they seemed to have a special exihibition too but I had no time to enter becuase the permanent exihibition was so much I should go again,"Written June 2, 2012"

5.0,Its an amazing experience thats worth even a quick stop; there are numerous amazing exhibits along with the great Turtle Ship replica,"Written June 10, 2022"
4.0,I did and didnt enjoy this The museum is big and if you want to see everything you should allow a few hours Free to enter Given all the information and history I am quite surprised they dont charge I just found information was not that easy to understand or well laid out I got more confused although at the sane time I did learn a lot of things I just think it could be laid out better Some parts were in Korean only I went as soon as it opened There were already quite a few school children but as the museum was so big and spacious it was still peaceful to browse Clean What was nice to watch was just outside the main entrance young army recruits were practising and performing This was interesting to see I would say if your very into history and learning then come I normally am but for some reason struggled to grasp much here I spent just over an hour and a half there for a basic overview,"Written June 2, 2022"

3.0,Ive had the good fortune of being able to visit the war museums in both North Korea and South Korea What is most striking is how similar the museums in Pyongyang and Seoul are  In front of both are aggressive statues of military men Both have an outdoor exhibit of military machinery like vehicles and airplanes But whereas the museum in Pyongyang proudly displays the USS Pueblo the museum in Seoul displays happy childrens mascots in uniform of course and a playground which is weird to say the least in a war museum Both museums love a good panorama exhibit  And finally both rely very heavily on propaganda For example the two different sides are called Attackers at dawn and Defenders of freedom And while the museum happily described the atrocities carried out by the North it does not mention with a single peep the atrocities carried out by the South The exact opposite can be said about the museum in Pyongyang of course  If you are looking for any kind of truth about the war you would have to look elsewhere But if youre interested in how a country wants to present their image about a war both museums are very interesting indeed,"Written July 31, 2020"

5.0,As a veteran I am a lover of places that price and honor the fellow and good military men and women of the past and present; Men and Women who gave the ultimate sacrifice for the sake of freedom and liberty In this vein I dedicate part of every travel we make with our company to search for Memorials and Museums of War  The War Memorial of Korea as expected for the history of this country is no disappointment It opened in 1994 on the former site of the army headquarters to exhibit and memorialize the military history of Korea and it holds an exquisite collection and memorabilia of several past wars ranging from prehistoric times with very rudimentary weapons; passing with extreme detail throughout the Korean War and the ROK Armed Forces until more modern conflicts and the presence of South Korea as an allied in the United Nations  13000 items are displayed in six halls under different themes and about 100 large weapons are displayed in the outside exhibition area on the lawns around the building  Outside the building premises you can see a great variety of mobile units such as fixedwing aircrafts like the De Havilland Canada U6A Beaver the Curtiss C46D20CU Commando also the Fairchild C123J built in 1956 as a C123B and later converted to a C123J in the 1960s Helicopters are also in the premises such as the Bell AH1J \xe2\x80\x9cInternational Cobra\xe2\x80\x9d also the Bell UH1B Iroquois even Russian units as the Sikorsky H5H Dragonfly and the Sikorsky HH19B Chickasaw But there are more mobile units such as armored vehicles artillery and antiaircraft guns Missiles and several other maritime vessels like the Hurricane Aircat Airboat used by ROK special forces during the Vietnam War and much more well kept pieces of war history are exhibited here at the War Memorial of Korea  The place definitely has been groomed to detail and has also a special glow about it; meaning a building with a soul I truly recommend this place for the lovers of War History and War Artifacts and here you will also find a special place for the special connection we have with those who gave it all for the sake of freedom in South Korea and everywhere else,"Written January 28, 2020"
5.0,I planned to go here mainly for my boys Ages 9 and 6 because they wanted to see tanks and planes but I surprisingly learned a lot The guide we had Mr Kim was very knowledgeable and it was so interesting to see how grateful he was to the US and their help He says if it wasnt for the US and their help they would be a communist country under North Korea It was interesting to hear the history from someone who actually experienced it Definitely a must see,"Written January 27, 2020"
5.0,one of the must see museums in my opinion they did a great job presenting the Korean war and its immediate aftermath the museum used to be a bit too much propaganda but they have make it more objective  gone are the famous pictures of the happy children of South Korea and the starving children of North Korea that was a bit too much in my opinion the museum is close to the national museum see my review and the Samsun ilan museum in near by Itaewon Itaewon is still a good bet for lunch or dinner after musuem hopping,"Written January 27, 2020"

5.0,Seoul has many state funded museums and forms the ones Ive visited or know of all are well presented It seems little is spared to put on a hood high quality show The National War Museum is no different It showcases her military history from the earliest period up to the Korean War Youd be surprised that Korea is not the doormat people perceive But a proud and sophicated nation There are things on display that you would not expect and not mentioned in books elsewhere Ive seen pictures of the turtle boat but to sea in person is a nice experience Yes is a scaled replica but its still impressive There is also the large outdoor display With a number of Korean War period planes and tanks Also other retired items of hardware Youd have to pay good money to see this elsewhere but all free in Seoul There is a B52 bomber which is smaller than I thought At the time of my visit done halls and the outdoor display was closed off for maintenance There are plenty of toilets most displays have English and I suppose the only let down is that the giftshop You can spend a fair few hours here,"Written September 25, 2019"

5.0,Thats the poignant catch phrase that sums up the general feel of the War memorial  There are indoor and outdoor exhibits that makes this old school museum a sight to behold The exhibits are grouped into 2 main rooms  one from the norths and one from the souths perspectives  There are complimentary tours with a volunteer doyenne and I barely made it to the 2pm session with Chang theres one more at 10am although there is plenty of English explanation and if you use the guided audio youd be in good stead  Chang brought life to our walk particularly when he provided a glimpse to his life as a Korean War survivor he was barely 3 then and how his ancestral home was South according to the 38 Parallel but because of the DMZ now belonged to the North and hes rendered homeless If you know how much the Koreans repeat nay treasure their ancestral hometowns you can almost hear his angst through his thick accented English  Yet his gratitude and humility shone through  All in all an educational tour And a must see Set aside 34 hours to go through the exhibits thoroughly,"Written September 8, 2019"

5.0,The best military museum Ive ever seen Koreas War Memorial has about 650000 squarefeet under roof and more than 60 fixedwing aircraft choppers tanks artillery pieces missiles and naval vessels outside in the rain You get a crash course in the history of Korean warfare from neolithic spearfights to modern times civil wars between ancient ethnic groups invasions by the Chinese Japanese Mongols Manchus and so on; the centurieslong Japanese pirate fleet threat; the 19th century attacks by various Western powers; all the way up to the Vietnam War when more than a third of a million ROK troops supported Saigon  Most of these wars battles sieges victories and defeats will be terra incognita to foreign visitors But its all interesting and wellpresented Curatorship is outstanding 21st century technology helps if you see locals watching any animation on pirate fleets citywall sieges et cetera stop and watch the spectacle with them  Most military museums focus on generals and admirals soldiers and sailors strategy tactics and the various regiments or battleships involved in the fighting The War Memorial goes beyond the fighting forces to also provide information about noncombatants This is underscored before you even walk into the museum in monumental statues of both soldiers and the victims of war see The Warriors and The Victims photos  Not surprisingly half the indoor area is focused on the 1950s Korean War I walked in with a fair grasp of the military changes of fortune in that war such as the Norths surprise attack which captured Seoul within 48 hours What Id never known before was that not only did the Northerners carefully plan exactly how and when theyd attack but they also carefully planned the sweeping atrocities they would inflict on the civilian population of Seoul as soon as they captured the city If you were on their list you and your family disappeared within 48 hours of takeover; thousands were on their list  The museums information on the war is sweeping The commitments made to the North by Stalin and Mao prior to the attack Douglas MacArthurs determination to turn the tide with the Inchon landings against the opinion of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff and the massive winter counterattack of Chinese forces are all presented clearly and cogently  The Korean War is also unusual because of the ROKs powerful ally the United Nations fought on their side There have been UN peacekeeping missions since to the Balkans and other areas but never again anything like this Two dozen nations from Europe Asia Africa Australia and both North and South America fought under the UN flag to save the people and legitimate government of Korea Several rooms of the museum focus on the UN decision and the UN leadership of Trygve Lie The museum notes that immediately upon hearing of the attack on the ROK Lie called an emergency meeting of the Security Council for the next day and the UN support for the ROK was proposed argued revised and passed the same day The museum names the countries which supported the UN resolution the one who abstained Titos Yugoslavia and the member state which was absent the USSR It doesnt mention one interesting bit the USSRs delegate was refusing to attend UN meetings over a totally different issue\xe2\x80\x94the seating of the PRC\xe2\x80\x94another partner in the attack But had he attended I believe the USSR could simply have vetoed the resolution in which case the ROK wouldnt have been defended under the UN banner and the UN in all likelihood would have gone down the drain like the League of Nations At any rate you get to see a diorama of Douglas MacArthur receiving the UN flag that theyd all be fighting under see UN Flag photo  A large area of one floor provides information on every nation that sent military personnel to Korea as well as every nation that sent medical personnel some of Indias and Denmarks noncombatant personnel also died in Korea Each of these countries has a special area in the museum where you can learn how they contributed how long they were in Korea where they fought and how many died see Thailand Display photo The information for each country is in Korean English and that countrys national language Greeces in Greek; Colombias in Spanish and so on Since Belgium is bilingual you can read or hear about Belgian forces in Korean English French or Nederlands This United Nations aspect of the war is symbolized before you even enter the museum by the national flags of the contributing states flying in a semicircle around of the facade see International Flags photo  Each of the national stories is interesting Luxembourgs infantrymen were integrated for the duration with the Belgians and although the headcount of Luxembourg fighting forces was small as a percentage of total national population it was one of the highest of any of the countries Turkey sent a brigadesize integrated unit of artillery ordinance engineering and transport which inflicted ten times more enemy casualties that it received  In 1950 there were only three independent counties in subSaharan Africa; all three contributed South Africa sent pilots Liberia supported civilian relief I thought Ethiopias story was the most amazing of all Haile Selassie was a strong proponent of collective security; hed appealed for support from the League of Nations when Mussolini invaded Ethiopia and hadnt gotten it So he wanted Ethiopia to help Korea another innocent country but Ethiopia had no army Solution the Emperor sent his Palace Guards The guardsmen werent trained for combat so US instructors gave them a threemonth crash course and attached them to the US 7th Infantry Division The Imperial Guard did just fine the museum has videos of them marching upcountry where among other battles they fought at Pork Chop Hill  The museum also addresses the impact of the war on individual men and women of the allied nations For example an Aussie who left his pregnant wife to go to Korea died there; his wife never remarried; more than half a century later her ashes were buried in the Korean grave of the husband she lost in her youth see Mrs Shepherd photo Another Australian widow Nancy Hummerston was buried at Koreas UN Memorial Cemetery even more recently in 2010 sixty years after Captain Hummerston died defending the ROK  I spent the best part of a day here and could have spent longer had they not been closing Among my favorite sights were   A replica of an 500year old dragonbowed Korean battleship reduced to frigate size so it would fit in the central courtyard but still impressive Battleship photo   A grand gallery of military paintings around the walls of that courtyard including Koreas crushing defeat of a French invasion force sent by Napoleon III in 1866 KapkotJin photo; that same year Napoleon IIIs army was also beaten by the Mexicans; figuring the odds of losing three in a row were negligible the IIItime loser then declared war on Prussia   Korean \xe2\x80\x9cknights\xe2\x80\x9d using tridentspears rather than the lances of their European counterparts see Trident Knight photo   An ingenious ancient Korean contraption for rapid fire of multiple arrows see Gatling Bow photo   Something for the children a miniature Korean castle they can climb onto to man the bastions Hawseong Fortress photo   A huge drum commemorating the 60th anniversary of the founding of the ROK armed forces Mother of All WarDrums photo   A modest little inflatable Aircat airboat used by the ROK for river and marsh reconnaisance in Vietnam and equipped with A60 machineguns This beaut is outdoors with the other military hardware big impressive fighters bombers heavy artillery and tanks so the little fellow goes virtually unnoticed But back home in south Louisiana \xe2\x80\x9cCajuns\xe2\x80\x9d down on the bayous use airboats to get around in the swamps where they hunt alligators for gumbo You could hunt any number and size of gators you liked if you had an A60 machinegun on board ROK Aircat photo   Also outdoors but much nearer the street a 20yearold exact replica of the tallest of all Korean monuments a foursided monster 639 meters high inscribed with 1770 Chinese calligraphs The original still exists but was carted off to China long ago and isnt likely to be returned anytime soon An impressive placard informs us that \xe2\x80\x9cThe monument of King Gwanggaeto the Great 391413 was built by his son King Jangsu 413491 in 414 BC in Gungnaeseong the capital city of Goguryeo\xe2\x80\x9d to honor his fathers conquests and the founding of the kingdom And in small print were also advised that \xe2\x80\x9cThe translation of the inscription was advised by experts in the relevant fields in 2005\xe2\x80\x9d Apparently chronology wasnt one of the \xe2\x80\x9crelevant fields\xe2\x80\x9d that anybody was an expert in since 414 BC precedes 391413 BC rather than following it Still its an impressive replica of Koreas grandest ancient monument Monumental Error photo,"Written August 30, 2019"

5.0,I was not expecting much about this place but was surprised to see the indoor and outdoor displays They have a lot of tanks artillery fighter jets and even a huge air force B52 bomber on display There is also the coast guard cutter that still contains all the holes during the gun fight it had with the north koreans Even if the AV presentation was in Korean it provides a detailed blow by blow on the firefight  Very well kept and maintained which showcases how nationalistic the country is  Well worth a visit even for non Koreans who are history or war buffs,"Written July 7, 2019"
4.0,The museum provides a well illustrated history of the painful Korean war You leave the museum a lot wiser than you arrived Certainly in terms of the events of the war but perhaps more interesting you have a much better sense of the pain and deep wounds this meaningless war has had on the people of Korean Clearly the history and culture of Korean is deeply affected by the divide and you feel you understand this a little better after the visit If you are interested in military equipment this is definitely also a good place to visit,"Written July 6, 2019"
5.0,Excellent very educational place to visit Free admission Be prepared to spend about 3 hours there It is about 5 to 10 minutes from the subway station The signage at the subway station exit is not so clear though can certainly be improved  The museum is huge At the lawn outside there are exhibits of planes and a replica of a submarine Inside the museum there are lots of war relics and artifacts along with informationaleducational descriptions  Poignanttouchingchilling moments for me 1 the Statue of Brothers depicting 2 brothers hugging each other who fought for the opposite sides as South Korea vs North Korea soldiers; 2 the inscribed near the main entrance that said \xe2\x80\x9cif you want peace remember war\xe2\x80\x9d; 3 strolling through the Memorial Hall honoring the Korean war soldiers In the UN soldiers section names of USA soldiers far outnumbered those of other countries It said that is a copy of the Washington DCs Korean War Memorial I dont quite remember if I saw that during my DC visit so those who have recollections of both places can perhaps comment,"Written July 4, 2019"

4.0,Attempting to find ones way from the subway stations can be challenging since the signnage is very poor exit 12 from Line 6 is the easiest line 4 more difficult The memorial itself however is well presented and I am sure it would be much more interesting to those with a military background,"Written June 28, 2019"

5.0,For most of us who are uninitiated about the Korean War you mostly think of it as a US war like Vietnam However the War Memorial of Korea really open your eyes that it involved the UN and China  The museum doesnt just focus on the Korean war  it highlights how Korea fought in wars during the ancient days and its involvement in modern day conflicts  I joined a free guided tour in the morning Although the tour guides English was quite accented he was very enthusiastic about what he was talking about,"Written June 9, 2019"
4.0,Initially I thought this museum would just be focused on the Korean War but it went into a lot more details on other historical battles waged by long ago Kings  Outside there were a number of memorial statues as well as a large assortment of aircraft rockets and fighting vehicles that you could get up close to and peer inside A number of the armored personnel carriers were open but you could not go in Sets of stairs were brought next to a cobra helicopter so you could see inside the cockpit The PKM357 ship from the 2002 Battle of Yeonpyeong is displayed here with red paint detailing every area damaged during the battle This was the only display where you were allowed to climb onboard and see the bridge deck and guns up close and learn more about the battle that killed South Korean seamen  As I walked up to the entrance there were a number of black pillars dedicated to the UN and other countries that came to South Koreas defense during the Korean War In addition along the walkways to the side of the main entrance were large plaques with all of the names of soldiers from around the world who died in the war It was a lot of recognition and honor  Once I entered the museum it turned out to be a lot larger than I anticipated The bottom floor contained details about each kingdoms armies and battles and went into size arms skills and success In the central courtyard were wooden replicas of early Korean warships The top two floors went into extensive review of the Korean War with 4D movies dioramas and artifacts Additional planes limosines and arms were also displayed  Unfortunately I ran out of time but one could easily spend 23 hours here,"Written June 8, 2019"
5.0,The outside memorials are in my opinion the best part of the whole thing The statues and installations are very moving and well designed Inside the Korean War exhibits are very well put together and take you through each year of the war the help received by various countries and the contexts of the war My only critique would be that they seem to microscopically criticize the north in every facet while never accepting or elaborating on any of the shortcomings the south may have had In brief a broader and less biased history would have helped to understand the nuances of the war a little bit more  The memorial is free Which is awesome for budget travelers Near the entrance you can find huge walls with all the names of the victims from each respective country that died in the Korean War so that was also very special Its nice to see the recognition showed by Korea to every country that tried to help them If youre interested there are also war machines out in the front of the memorial with vehicles such as tanks and a big war ship,"Written June 7, 2019"
3.0,When youre interested in Korean history this museum is a must visit However I found it a bit dull The information was presented very simple without any extras  I think I expected more information about the course of the war The information could have been presented way more interactive or with some items to go with it,"Written June 6, 2019"
5.0,A beautiful interactive display of history that gives you opportunity to understand the importance of what it means to fight for your freedom War is scary but this gives the opportunity to be guided through history to understand the changes and development of people during the sone of worst decades in world history To see war bring together the most unlikely and war torn countries together to fight for the freedom of others and rebuilding of others Its an amazing,"Written June 4, 2019"

1.0,Wellit definitely IS a WAR museum I found it simply obnoxious We were led into a movie play which encountered me to be more like a counter strike video game It was a 4d movie Sitting there and watching the invasion of Incheon through a soldiers eye ok not my idea of a \xe2\x80\x9ewar museum\xe2\x80\x9cthat is supposed to be dealing with the terror of war but when these soldiers started to fire at their own but north korean people I was just simply shocked I have never ever seen such an impiety before It all reached its peak when some american tourists wanted to start clapping at the end of the \xe2\x80\x9eshow\xe2\x80\x9c But they wouldnt dare to as we all looked shocked and pissed and wouldnt want to clap The rest of this museum is ok but it rarely displays the terror of war it even more glorifies it It took me a few days to get rid of this disgusted feeling when I left the museum Its more like US Propaganda,"Written May 15, 2019"

5.0,Im not joking when I say that This place doubles as both a military museum with dozens of exhibit tanks helicopters aircraft and ships that make military history nerds like myself giggle with glee and a grand sombre memorial to the events that literally shaped the founding of the nation The exhibits chronicle Koreas history of invasion by foreign states its drive for selfdetermination and its fight to survive against its northern neighbour in the Korean War of 195053 The exhibits make many boasts of how the nation must be strong to ensure its safety but they never stray anywhere near nationalist or jingoistic themes If anything they serve to underscore the true destruction that war brings and that whilst it is never wrong to fight for the right cause the experience of war itself is something that should never be venerated or glorified  I spent almost 3 hours here  one completely lost in the maze of the vehicle yard outside and the other 2 in the gargantuan memorial building itself It was easy to navigate and although admission was free I made a donation at the end of my visit because of how immensely impressed I was with the experience If youre in Seoul and want to get a better understanding of South Koreas recent history this is something you cannot miss,"Written January 4, 2019"

3.0,The Korean War Memorial is a large imposing building near Samgakji metro station in an otherwise nondescript neighbourhood Its size is a testament to the centrality of the Korean war to the recent history and identity of the Republic of Korea and its troubled relationship to North Korea It is part shrine listing the names of the hundreds of thousands of South Korean and UNallied servicepeople who died in the war part museum giving detailed accounts of the war and part a propaganda organ shouting the Souths version of the conflict Despite the importance of its subject it is far too detailed even for a visitor  a military historian  who knows a bit about the war I saw two young Australian women who were enduring a detailed guided tour who plainly did not really want the detail they were being given A lot of the presentations deal with aspects of military operations of course and the audiovisual programs are often hard to understand The display outside the museum of military hardware is frankly underwhelming unless you really do want to see and climb into every variety of armoured personnel carrier that the South Korean army has ever used The galleries generally lack the element of the personal stories now obligatory in most military museums The presentation of the place which has been open for about 25 years is looking a bit tired eg the moat has been drained but its certainly worth visiting showing the impact of the Korean war on the country while the long corridors of names on the roll of honour which doesnt include the couple of million civilians the war killed is sobering,"Written September 16, 2018"

3.0,Its a weird scene a lot of onesided displays some really cool military hardware juxtaposed against mobs of schoolchildren all over the place Not really schoolchildren were talking barely kindergartners if that oddly posing with cartoon characters right next to massive bombers and such  Inside there was a memorial service for a hero of the Korean War killed in 1953 complete with wreaths speakers and many modernday military officers sitting and standing in attention in full regalia  Nearby a group of toddlers posed by a picture of an island that Korea currently disputes with Japan I dont speak Korean but the teacher was prodding them to raise their little fists in the air and shout something triumphalsounding so they could all take a group photo presumably proclaiming their solidarity with Koreas claim to the island Its a little scary Im not used to seeing preschool children being actively indoctrinated quite so overtly at quite such a tender age even in countries where youd think that kind of stuff goes on  The museum is free its huge theres a lot to see captivating propaganda for sure But propaganda nonetheless,"Written June 21, 2018"

5.0,my friends and i came across a statue of brothers in one of the souvenir stores at the DMZ and googled to find out more about the background it brought us to the War Memorial of Korea and i must say its a great choice we made to visit it the next day  im not sure if its a permanent exhibition we visited end Oct and outside there were airplanes warships and tanks model replicas on display you can view a 7 min show depicting the confrontation between South and North in Year 2002 resulting in the death of 6 South Korean officers the show only starts with minimum audience of 5 but the lady staff was kind to let us view it even though we were only 3 if you watched it you can better understand the exhibitions held in the war memorial building  there is a shooting simulation game in the Korean history exhibition if there are students around you may get a chance to try it my friends did with a bunch of school students i tried later on but the staff rejected me and pointed to the students only signboard  inside you can view a 3D clip too initially they refused to start the clip as i was the only one waiting there but to my surprise they allow a caucasian couple to enter so unless you are caucasian or you can speak conversational korean you probably will be ignored i followed the couple in and a male staff wearing a suit manager maybe went to call for other visitors around a korean elderly tour group to join in  was told to fasten our seatbelts so we thought its those 4D shows where your chairs can rock but to our disappointment nothing happened the 3D clip was just a pilots view on a fighter jet NOT WORTH VIEWING  however there are many interactive screens and many wellmade replicas of various incidents and information on South Koreas involvement in the Worlds war assistance very educational  theres a cafe in the war memorial building serve desserts and waffles the souvenir shop sells similar items to those sold in DMZ  if you are into history this is the place for you,"Written November 15, 2015"

5.0,Its no secret that a proxy albeit very costly war was fought across both halves of the Korean peninsula in the 1950s Its also needs no big stretch of the imagination that the truce could be irreversibly broken again at any time due to the diametrically opposed political beliefs of the North and South Korean governments With this as the background this rather grandiose building at least at first glance might appear to serve as a temple to the glories or war True there are many exhibits that come across as unreservedly nationalistic and play on the werethegoodies and theyrethebaddies mentality But delve beneath the surface of the exhibits and there are many instances where the suffering of the Korean people is a central theme of a deeper desire for reunification  Theres a lot to keep the visitor occupied and for military enthusiasts its best to keep at least a halfday free In fact the memorial portion of the building is actually quite small compared to the Korean War displays with plenty of mention of United Nations especially American contributions that take up a couple of floors in one wing Other interesting sections include one on the local armed forces more recent skirmishes between the two Koreas as well as one on warfare during the Joseon period circa late14th to late19th centuries Displays range from old sailing vessels to cannons to military hardware Indeed military hardware from the 20th century takes up an enormous external parklike space adjacent to the memorial building and could easily require over an hour to do it proper justice  The easiest subway station is Samgakji serviced by lines 4 and 6 from where its an easy 5minute walk to the entrance gates of the Memorial,"Written August 29, 2015"

5.0,This is a review for both the memorial and the museum which should really be considered one  First off the memorial itself was beautiful and powerful The statues really give a sense of the struggles of the past and even the present day split between the people of Korea  Secondly the museum allows you to see all sorts of historical jets tanks weapons armor etc etc that youd be hard pressed to find elsewhere Truly a fantastic experience for any fan of military history Theres also a lot of history from before the Korean war in the memorial you can even see a replica of a Korean turtle ship  When I visited in May they even had a performance that happened right outside the museum They had various martial arts performances followed by a marching performance done by all four branches of the Korean Armed Forces Quite a sight to behold  Also its free I dont see why anyone would miss this unless history completely bores you,"Written July 27, 2015"

3.0,I was impressed with the well thought architecture the meticulous effort in detail and variety of displays of the Korean war and the informative history of the Korean warfare I could feel a sincere homage paid to UN forces that helped defend South Korea  However it could have been better if it also showed more about North Korean and Chinese young souls who were dragged into the war at the time of emerging Cold War era and it should have been millions of civilian victims and divided families that must be in the center of focus in the tragedy instead of glorifying war heroes  It is more of a museum for war heroes and less of a memorial for war victims,"Written August 21, 2014"
3.0,We came expecting a poignant memorial to the Korean war It is not this at all and if I was reviewing it was a memorial I do not think it is very good at all This is a museum dedicated to the Korean War  Outside the memorial there are plenty of military planes tanks and missiles This sums up the internal exhibits It is a subjective look at the war You do learn a lot about a war that was effectively a world war one that killed millions in just 6 months and then another million in the two years of negotiations  Other exhibits include a military look at Korean History with dioramas There are free guided tours where the volunteer can explain the Korean War in detail We were lucky and had a History student who was able to discuss the political discourse with us  The one area that was dedicated to peace seemed very tacky to me and I felt it didnt commemorate the memory of those who died It was a room with faux tombstones that had battles projected on to them  If you come expecting a museum of war then this is a good place to spend a few hours learning a bit about the Korean war If you come expecting a museum of peace and commemoration then like me you will be disappointed I do think it was a bit too brazen and glorified the fighting a too much but then most museums about war seem to  It is free and is close to the subway You just need to walk around the American base to get here,"Written August 8, 2014"

4.0,While living in Korea for three years my return visit with my mom was my first time here Autumn brought in a melancholic pretty and quiet atmosphere in the place Part of the exhibit in the lobby was the commemorative display naming all the Cheonan ship soldiers who died in the sinking and I thought it was sad beautiful  considerate Im not sure of the right word  and fitting to include them in the museum We were hoping to find my grandfathers  my immediate and his cousins  name as part of the first contingent who went to Korea during the war It was only later on that we realized only the Koreans names were included poor research our bad Nonetheless it was a good eye opener about Koreas history the invasions the wars  it explained a lot of what and how Korea came to be; in culture thinking perspectives  As we were leaving the museum we had this wonderful surprise of the soldiers doing a presentation of sorts  I forgot the festival My mother as a humanities professor enjoyed the show very much despite not understanding the narration It was a pleasant surprise and we enjoyed every bit of our visit in and outside the premises,"Written July 3, 2014"

5.0,Husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this museum The indoor museum had more than just exhibits on the Korean War There were war exhibits from Koreas medieval period as well The corridors with lists of names of soldiers who died in the Korean War were well laid out and had a sense of serenity to it The outdoor museum was where the display of military vehicles was located You are allowed to see the displays up close and even explore the insides of some of the vehicles Even though I am not Korean and not a warmilitary enthusiast I found this place thoroughly enjoyable and is an honorable tribute to the fallen soldiers  My only regret was not getting to the museum earlier We arrived about 2 hours before closing time and had taken our time in the memorial corridor looking at the names of soldiers Hence we were unable to cover all floors of the indoor museum before closing time In hindsight we should have gone straight to the indoor museum and covered that first since we were able to take our time looking at the outdoor exhibits after museum closing time,"Written July 2, 2014"

5.0,I love history I have always loved history When I was a student in elementary and high school I always dedicated extra time to my history books; I wanted to understand why things are the way they are While studying abroad in college I found it fascinating that other countries tell the same story but with a different perspective After that revelation I have always enjoyed my history books in foreign countries and in foreign languages and learning new things about any given event It is fascinating to read about the SpanishAmerican war IN SPAIN And it seems an alternate universe to read about the USA in any given European Asian or Latin American country Thus I was prepared for revelations and new information the moment we entered the facility First the museum is free to all visitors; second it is a selfguided tour; you take a brochure and map and view things at your own pace The light and sound shows are well done and not overly exaggerated which would have reduced their message There are a couple that require a minimum of 5 people to begin We missed a couple because we were just 4 people  A word of caution however this museum is about all Korean wars not just the last one You will spend some time in 5th century feuding kingdoms see the play off between the Tang dynasty and Japan and the Mongol hordes over the next thousand years What once were 3 kingdoms with double the land area eventually contracted to one kingdom near the end of the 19th century before the Japanese invasion And then finally the full thrust and import to foreigners the events leading up to and including the Korean war 1950 to 1953  We all learned as high school students that the rapid removal of American troops and Secretary Achesons definition of Korea as outside the American defense perimeter after World War II contributed to the boldness on the part of the north to launch the war We didnt learn that North Korean leadership asked for permission from both the Soviet Union and China before launching their attack on the south and other interesting facts that did not come to light until after the collapse of the Soviet Union opened all those secret archives But the most interesting points to me were the minor one off events that became determining points in the war What if the ROK forces had not blown up the bridges over the Han River halting the Norths Russian tank advance for 6 days time enough for Truman to get troops to territory still held by ROK forces What if MacArthur had not gambled on a surprise landing at Incheon leading to the collapse of North Korean supply lines and the rapid retreat of the invasion force all the way back to the Chinese border What if the Chinese hadnt been so worried about an American ally on its border and hadnt entered the war What if Truman had authorized use of the ABomb So many what ifs to consider a dedicated student of history will find many such small but highly decisive events to ponder  I highly recommend this museum They say history is written by the victors and in the same way a people tell of their successes they often gloss over their failures and their shames I respect the Korean people immensely for coming to grips just over 10 years ago with the infamous 1950 summer of terror for not whitewashing what happened during that early tragic phase of the war Unfortunately I did not find that reference at this museum,"Written June 26, 2014"

4.0,This memorial is comprehensive assembly of the military history of Korea and tribute to the veterans The best parts of the museum are those devoted to the Korean war At times I wish it had gone deeper into the history and the sequence of battles You can spend about as long at the museum as you like if you really dig into all the stories and testimonies That said sometimes those testimonies are shallow and lack detail Some knowledge of the sequence of the battles in the Korean war certainly helps one to appreciate the different displays It is a bit disjointed in its presentation in that some parts seem to be chronologically out of sequence You do get a real sense of the feeling of violation to be invaded by a hostile neighbor and the sacrifice that was made which at times appeared to be a losing cause fortunately it did not end that way In that sense the memorial is an effective tribute Outside it has a very extensive collection of military hardware including tanks and aircraft This site is easily reached by subway and food is available on site,"Written May 26, 2014"
5.0,With so many good reviews I wasnt sure I could add value with one more but I do think there are a couple important points First it is not a Korean War Memorial and by that I mean it is not just about what westerners think of as the Korean War It is a memorial to many more battles and wars going back thousands of years Second the admission is free and there are free guided tours as well When we went there were two options for a free tour at 10 AM  the official one and one given by a volunteer from Visit Seoul Walking Tours We chose the volunteer At first we wondered if we made the right choice since his English was not quite as good as the official guide but he gave us a longer more indepth and quite a personal tour If you are pressed for time go with the official tour If you have the time go with the volunteer guide,"Written May 14, 2014"

5.0,This comprehensive museum really helps understanding the unique history as well as the backround of the present day circumstances in Korean peninsula While presenting the history from the South Korean point of view the museum manages to be neutrally informative instead of giving a propagandistic view of any of the participants at any given time We happened to visit the museum before the trip to the DMZ and I totally recommend this particular order since youll be equipped with so much more basic knowledge to get the most out of the DMZ visit,"Written April 8, 2014"

5.0,I missed this last time I was in Seoul but managed to make it this time and very happy I did This is a wonderful respectful memorial to the many people and countries that participated in the Korean War All displays are multilingual English speakers will have no problems participating or reading any of the displays I spent about two hours there but could have spent more There are lots of exhibits and items on display from small bullets all the way to a B52 They have items from both sides so you get a very good idea of what the forces on both sides had available There also displays from Koreas early history that were interesting The entire museum outside and inside is free and appears to be very accessible to those with special needs Look for the elevator signs on the exterior and that will take you the main floor Once there you will also find elevators to take you to each floor There is ample room in the display areas if you are in a wheel chair or on crutches It is very friendly in that sense There is a small gift shop mostly for kids and cafe in the museum if you need a quick snack If you drive there is underground parking available I cant forget to mention that it is a memorial and it is tastefully done I was impressed by the panels placed in the exterior wings that honored all of the deceased allies The names were listed by country and the US deceased were listed alphabetically by name and state The list includes servicemen from the US commonwealths as well so Puerto Rico etc Were also there Beneath each panel there was a fresh white carnation which I was told is replaced everyday Very nice touch and contributed to the solemnity of this area Another very nice touch is the huge sign across from the memorial that says Thank you United Nations for your help and then shows the flags of every country that sent combatants and non combatants to support the South Koreans I liked this a lot and will go again,"Written April 5, 2014"

4.0,The Korean war memorial is a deifinite visit though it feels a little off putting knowing that it is surrounded by American military bases and the westerner district it gives you the sense that this may not really be as Korean as you might believe The pieces are exquisite and the layering of pieces is amazing as you start at the bottom in the ancient era and ascend to the modern The Korean war section is excellent though filled with tons of propoganda and from that point on you feel as if the museum is slowly turning into one giant recruitment strategy but aside from this biasis nature you are in for a treat as you Korean history come to life,"Written March 23, 2014"

5.0,To give priority once you get inside this vast building are the three rooms of the Korean War on the second  third floors to put in perspective the entire display area of each of the Hiroshima  Nagasaki Abomb museums Im quite sure can almost be fit into just one of the three rooms upstairs here where youll learn or actually almost relive the Korean War among impressive displays of quiterealistic looking wax sculptures especially liked how those 3D displays kind of blend in with the big background scenes behind them; you might have a hard time looking at your own pics later to tell which of the images are sculptures  which are part of the background scene such as those of soldiers crossing the 38th Parallel General Douglas MacArthur at a table with the first South Korean President a soldier raising the South Korean flag in front of their Capitol building children learning at a makeshift school outdoors and some reconstruction being done by civilians  soldiers with a background scene of the devastated city  all of which in my opinion are really wellthoughtout displays that portray some of the important aspects  moments of the war as vividly as possible And to top off your almost reliving experience of the war be sure to catch the 4D show in one of the two rooms either the Room I or the Room II on the second floor  an absolutely outstanding though only for about 10 minutes documentary of the famous Incheon Landing that decisively turned the tide of the war with the great opening line I am General Douglas MacArthur and I will bring hammer upon anvil and yes I can guarantee an upclose experience of sights  sounds of that landing as you can naturally expect from a 4D show the sounds of bombardment  such will be loud  The first floor though if youre pressed for time they close at 6 pm after the great rooms upstairs is where you can kind of walk through since theres not much to learn at the General War History room with like prototype soldier  equipment displays of some Western nations as well but no theme of a particular war as the rooms upstairs and theres the dark room for memorial purposes which is just meant to kind of pay respect  pass through; and for some ancient history theres the big time line of Korea all the way from like AD 100 the big painting of a battle scene of a preJoseon time which is actually lit up on  off for different parts of the painting my favorite display on the entire first floor and a replica of the famed Admiral Yi Sun Shins turtle boat a smaller replica Im sure though than the actual turtle boat  And outside the building be sure to get to the right side of the grounds the right side as youre facing the building or equivalently to your left after coming out of the building where there are quite a number of military vehicles for land sea  air some tanks with really long cannons that I noticed; for the sea specifically though is only one big boat but it can be gone up on board where theres a 5minute documentary of a naval incident that actually took place not too long ago shown in 4D just like the Incheon Landing documentary inside the building as mentioned above And apart from those military vehicles there are two big sets of sculptures I believe one set represents the South  the other represents the North with a tall monument between them on one end of the grounds right by the street actually straight from the building entrance on the other end and a twobrothers statue on like a lagoon maybe supposedly a hill can be entered but nothing much inside on the left side of the grounds the left side as youre facing the building or equivalently to your right after coming out of the building which is the opposite side of the grounds from the military vehicles Also just outside the building entrance on each side are big plates with names of soldiers who died in the war similar to the big wall at the UN Cemetery in Busan although the names here are on individual plates and not on a wall  Coming by subway Samgakji Station on Lines 4  6 is where to get off followed by just about a 5minute walk and youll be at the twobrothers statue; just do keep in mind it takes about 4 hours in total for both inside  outside and the 6 pm closing time and I do suggest as mentioned above to start with the three rooms of the Korean War on the second  third floors; the outside can be done even after the closing time actually except maybe for going up the boat,"Written January 31, 2017"

4.0,Its free to visit so why not stop by Even if you just go for the walk around of the mostly Korean War equipment pieces they have on display outdoors its worth the 12 hour alone  One complaint if you will is the thin amount of material on the Korean War I know there are 3 entire rooms devoted to it but in actuality there isnt all that much  outside of the vast equipment on display outside   For a country so war torn in its long history a visit here gives one perspective and appreciation for what they have gone thru and with the help out outside nations retained minus of course the northern half of the country,"Written October 13, 2016"

5.0,I have been to the Armed Forces Museum in Taipei Taiwan before and compared to that I must say that the War Memorial of Korea is really huge It is conveniently located next to either Namyeong Station or Noksapyeong Station The museum can be a good addition as a next stop afterwards if you have a prior Koridoor DMZ or JSA tour since the Koridoor office is very close to Namyeong Station itself  The indoor section of the museum itself consists of 3 floors of various exhibits from the ancient period such as the Three Kingdoms of Korea to the modern day Of course the highlights in the exhibits are heavily focused on the Korean War which is often known as the Forgotten War due to the more well known Vietnam War overshadowing it There are plenty to see within the exhibits such as firearms uniforms and scale models of military vehicles Sometimes there are also special exhibits that are shown for a limited time In our case the museum held a special exhibition regarding firearms used by actors or actresses in Korean films It was very fascinating to see rather unique firearms closeup first hand  There is also the outdoor section of the museum which display various military vehicles artillery and aircraft and even a replica 11 scale of a South Korean patrol boat The amount of vehicles here is simply astonishing and well preserved You can see both Western and Soviet tanks and aircraft such as the M4 Sherman and T34 or even the massive B52 Stratofortress jet bomber You can even go into the back of the APCs such as the M113 for some memorable photos There is definitely plenty of stuff for everyone to take photos with  I would recommend at least 2 hours just to cover the inside of the museum itself and it is very ideal for a rainy day activity However do take note it is closed on Mondays though For those with an interest in military history or those who want to know more about the Cold War legacy that still continue to plague the Korean Peninsula this is a must go Best of all it is free,"Written October 11, 2016"

5.0,Enjoyed this place tremendously The exhibits were very informative and gave me an idea of what it was like when Korea was at war Many pictures videos and relics  all of which provide new experiences of learning  The time you can spend here varies Personally I spent 4hrs here because Im the sort of person who reads and studies every single exhibit and stop to watch every show and video But there are some people who breeze and browse through quite quickly and could possibly finish everything in about an hour I guess it depends on what interests you  There was a 4D show in one of the exhibits on the 2nd level that illustrated the operations of the Incheon Landing That was rather impressive I thought By 4D I mean that you will be secured to your seat because the motion chairs move according to whether youre on a boat or a plane  Another thing that was really impressive was how you could use your smartphone to read more about the exhibits  either by NFC or QR scanning Beside the exhibits there would be a little panel for you to scan which would automatically open a page on your phone The page contained information about what you are seeing and would sometimes lead you to YouTube videos to illustrate it What a great way to learn  One of the must visit places if youre in to history,"Written September 27, 2016"

5.0,A lot of effort has been put in to this national museum Entry is free and one probably gains much more understanding than by a visit to The Border with the North It is in Seoul and easily accessible so no excuse not to visit for anyone with even the slightest interest in why Korea is the way it is today  The outside displays include an array of military hardware large enough to fight a small war collected from most of the nations which armed the 1950s conflict All including a full size B52 bomber shoehorned together in to a remarkably small area to make a massive 3D jigsaw The best view of all this is obtained from the deck of the heavily shell and bulletpitted gunboat which has found its way in to the ornamental lake in front of the buildings  All the nations flags and soldiers of the UN forces are commemorated in a huge memorial area  Koreans have a history of war to equal any European nation and this is outlined inside in an illustrated timeline covering several large rooms The internal displays include a horrific and moving portrayal of the Japanese occupation  We also saw many groups of South Korean school children all in their pretty uniforms being taken around the premises being introduced to the facts of Korean life and geopolitical circumstances Sad but essential,"Written September 22, 2016"

5.0,Finally visited this Memorial and Museum on my third visit to Seoul I wanted to make sure I allowed enough time to completely do it justice as I know it is a very large complex and other visitors have said they spent the better part of two days here  The hours of the memorial are 9a6p TuesSunday Closed Monday and Holidays Admission is free No free wifi unless you have an Olleh service planaccount Cafe on site and gift shop Nice bathrooms and water fountains Free lockers so you can stash your bagbackpack and easily accessible for wheel chair or strollers  When we arrived just before 10am we took a docent guided tour with Mr Jun a volunteer from Seoul City Hall The tour lasted approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes and he took us through the galleries pointing out the highlights and most important points of the Korean War He is very intelligent and speaks English very well The information he provided was concise and interesting It was a good introduction If you dont have hours to spend here I recommend taking a docentled tour to give you the highlights of the memorial and gallery exhibits Otherwise youll get too far into the weeds and run out of time before you get out of the first gallery  After the tour we went back through the galleries taking our time to read the captions and look at the artifacts and maps As this war occurred before my time and doesnt receive the emphasis in history classes in the US there is a lot we didnt know about the origins and details of the war The exhibits really filled in a lot of gaps and cleared up a lot of confusion Of course I understand this is the South Korean view of the war so I know theres just a little bit of propaganda  The highlights are the multiple films you can watch There are a total of 4 films Two are 4D where you wear 3D glasses and there are special effects like movement or snow one is 3D and one is a regular cinema film only in Korean without English subtitles but watching the film you can easily understand whats going on Very good  Outside youll find a variety of military airplanes including a B52 tanks and artillery Theres also a reproduction of the Cheonan which was attacked and sunk by North Korea in 2010 The film here shows the attack and theres a Heroes Gallery memorializing the six sailors who died  All in all this is a wonderful museum We found it a perfect complement to a DMZJSA tour to really make everything clear and more understandable  There are plans to expand the memorials grounds upon acquisition of land currently occupied by the US military they plan to move out in the coming years Will make the current park even more appealing  Easily reached by Subway lines 4 or 1 or via bus About a 45 minute walk south of the Millennium HiltonSeoul Station and not far from Itaewon,"Written September 12, 2015"
5.0,Outside this unmissable cathedrallike building are two very striking statue sequences almost Comminist or Socialist Realism in their heroic exhortative poses Then there are the various tanks armoured fighting vehicles aircraft and marine craft involved in the conflict on the peninsula since 1950 They are well laidout with good explanatory boards for each external exhibit The huge B52 dominates all of these and sets the context  Inside the exhibition is laid out chronologically over three floors each with two wings It is vast inside Each stage of the conflict is depicted using film sound static displays and sonetlumiere all to great educational and learning effect There are displays of social and 2d art and curiously in the main foyer an armoured junk which if used during the Korean War then someone was in real trouble  There is also on the entry to the main ramp a Hall of remembrance with large marble slabs depicting the names of The Fallen from Korea in Hangul  This superb museum is an exhibition par excellence and a visitor would find it rewarding and informative even if they were not interested in warfare An absolute must seemust do,"Written September 10, 2015"

4.0,The War Memorial is a really essential place to visit for those interested in the history of Korea and how it came to be divided into the two North and South Koreas which we know now One cannot technically blame the South Koreans for depicting North Koreans and Chinese soldiers as the evil communists namely due to the effect of media propaganda in the 1960s and 1970s which suffered from the communist scare and that also filters off into the exhibitions which also dealt with the North Korean army as well,"Written September 2, 2015"

5.0,Its no secret that a proxy albeit very costly war was fought across both halves of the Korean peninsula in the 1950s Its also needs no big stretch of the imagination that the truce could be irreversibly broken again at any time due to the diametrically opposed political beliefs of the North and South Korean governments With this as the background this rather grandiose building at least at first glance might appear to serve as a temple to the glories or war True there are many exhibits that come across as unreservedly nationalistic and play on the werethegoodies and theyrethebaddies mentality But delve beneath the surface of the exhibits and there are many instances where the suffering of the Korean people is a central theme of a deeper desire for reunification  Theres a lot to keep the visitor occupied and for military enthusiasts its best to keep at least a halfday free In fact the memorial portion of the building is actually quite small compared to the Korean War displays with plenty of mention of United Nations especially American contributions that take up a couple of floors in one wing Other interesting sections include one on the local armed forces more recent skirmishes between the two Koreas as well as one on warfare during the Joseon period circa late14th to late19th centuries Displays range from old sailing vessels to cannons to military hardware Indeed military hardware from the 20th century takes up an enormous external parklike space adjacent to the memorial building and could easily require over an hour to do it proper justice  The easiest subway station is Samgakji serviced by lines 4 and 6 from where its an easy 5minute walk to the entrance gates of the Memorial,"Written August 29, 2015"

4.0,Fascinating museum suitable for all ages as the museum has currently the only war museum designed for children Most of what we saw was the childrens area which fascinated our 7 year old twins No doubt the focus was a South Korean perspective as one would expect Im sure the North Korean equivalent would tell a contrasting perspective,"Written July 19, 2015"
2.0,Im fascinated by the Korean War and I was really looking forward to seeing this museum but I was hugely disappointed in it; this is less of a museum than an exercise in propaganda in which the heroic South Koreans and savior Americans defeat the evil North Korean  Chinese Communists A more balanced and nuanced perspective on the history of this important war would do much to contribute to educating the public about it but this museum is really a waste of time I hate to say The only thing that piqued my interest was the huge model of Admiral Yi Sunshins famous turtle ship that he used to defeat the Japanese in the Seven Years War 15921598 The Korean government needs to commission a group of Korean War scholars to revise the text in English and Korean of all of the exhibits in the museum; Id suggest Prof Bruce Cumings of the University of Chicago one of the leading experts on the Korean War Until and unless this is done this museum will have limited credibility as a history museum,"Written July 18, 2015"
5.0,If you are interested in history and war this is the place for you It is huge We spent a whole day there The only complaint is that the Korean war section is bordering to being too long,"Written July 18, 2015"
5.0,The War Memorial of Korea is a place of epic proportions appropriate for a place that pays tribute to just about every single battle fought on Korean soil in recorded history The visitor route starts in the actual memorial room which is very plain and then moves downstairs to a huge display recounting all of the battles of the medieval and early modern eras Some of the information on specific battles was a bit dense and this section felt somewhat repetitive as one battle against the ChineseJapanese turns into another This section does make use of replica fortress walls and a turtle ship and also includes the first fantastic lifesize diorama and audiovisual presentation more of which are found in the Korean War display The Korean War display is the real highlight of the museum and is worthy of lots of your time The lifesized scenes showing soldiers crossing the 38th parallel soldiers defending bridges in Seoul and the signing of the armistice really brought the history to life After this I went outside and explored the park with its countless tanks missiles and planes on show The War Memorial of Korea is a truly impressive museum but I wish I had taken a moment when I got there to figure out exactly what bits I wanted to see before aimlessly starting my visit When I visited they were giving away FREE copies of a daybyday history of the Korean War in English and Korean which I thought was a great idea for a meaningful souvenir for visitors to take away The War Memorial is a mustsee for anyone visiting Seoul,"Written July 18, 2015"

4.0,Spent one hour exploring the museum What really made the whole experience come alive was the English tour It covered the Korean War in as much possible as an hour allowed They have some fascinating exhibits but the tour really helped all these things to come alive The korean war even holds 2 guiness world records Something I didnt know but was impressed by Go find out what Try your best to get on a tour though as you will simply learn so much more I would not have enjoyed the museum as much if it werent for the tour,"Written July 15, 2015"

5.0,I thought that I knew the history of the Korean War but this museum gave me so much more and in a very interesting way It made the history come live and made me curious for even more info There is an interesting and very impressive collection of original airplanes and vehicles from the war and in addition you can see more modern vehicles used by the Korean army The long rows of stone columns with endless rows of names on South Korean soldiers who died during the Korea War made me quiet and thoughtful I cant really comprehend the extent of the casualties such a war takes The history is taking you right up to the newest incidences in the Korean conflict including the naval incidents 1999 2002 and 2010 This clearly shows why South Korean people and government still take the situation very seriously The Korean War Museum is a mustsee if youll try to understand not just that particular war but also the whole situation in the East Asian area,"Written July 14, 2015"
5.0,The title of this attraction does not do it justice as it is so much more than just a memorial but an entire complex and museum where you could easily spend half a day  The property itself is gorgeous containing many sculptures of the war and an entire field of tanks planes and other weapons which are cool to look at and explore  The museum itself is very well done and surprisingly completely free The bottom floor contains Korean history and an overview of all the dynastys while the other floors focus on the Korean war  I honestly didnt know much about the war before coming here nor am I a big museum person but I found this museum to be extremely informative and engaging and I learned quite a lot  This is a great way to spend an afternoon learn some history and see some tanks ,"Written July 14, 2015"

3.0,Decided to go here as we had booked a trip to the border of Koreas for the next day and wanted to be as informed as possible The museum is very large an you need to take some time to go through it The history starts from way back and we were mainly interested in the modern history so we sort of rushed through the stone age etc parts and spent more time getting to know the recent history We found it to be a bit too onesided which of course can be understood but would have been interesting to know a bit more about the reasons etc of the wars but it turned out to be a how much do we love the UN for standing with us kind of experience The next day we took the trip to the border and turned out that theres a ton of information and slideshows included in the tours with much deeper level of recent history than the museum had so in case you are going here just to be informed about the recent 100 years maybe history and you are going to the border trip as well dont bother Otherwise if you are interested in history this is your kind of place Entrance is free which is a plus Be aware that its closed on Mondays throughout the year,"Written July 6, 2015"

5.0,No question this was the most interesting thing I visited while in South Korea It is very easily accessible from the Samgakji train stop no more than a 10 minute walk Just make sure you get out of the correct exit I would save about 3 hours to go through it quickly and hopefully its not a rainy day as there are some very impressive memorials old tanks vehicles places boats and missals on display outside Along with a few large passage ways which honor every solider that was killed in duty from every country and even state Inside its just massive and gives you a great run down of what happened why it happened and where things stand today which i knew very little of the history Obviously there are artifacts galore on the war but its much more than that too I highly recommend this Oh yeah and its Free,"Written July 2, 2015"
5.0,I totally LOVED this museum I am a bit of a war history geek so this place was like heaven As you enter there is a very moving statue that is a tribute to the Korean War and while much of this museum is dedicated to Korean War history there are also displays about other military campaigns and military artifacts from the entirety of Korean history On the grounds of the museum there are a lot of aircraft and tanks and troop transport vehicles that have played a significant role in Korean Military history  most impressive is an American B52 Inside there are more displays that highlight the history of the Korean War as well as a limousine that belonged to Kim Il Sung that was captured by the ROK Army during the Korean War The highlight of the museum  the reason for my visit  was the large scale model of a Turtle Ship which is the ship that was used by Admiral Yi Soon Shin to defeat the Japanese Navy in 1592,"Written July 2, 2015"

5.0,Im not the biggest fan of museums more so of remembering any war Having said this I would have to say that a visit to Korea would be incomplete without at least taking a look at the collection technology throughout the decades The displays are either replicas or the real artifact that saw battle in the wars that South Korea has been involved with There are also many vehicles and weapons that have been collected throughout the museums history to give a better view of what may have happened at that particular time in history This museum much like the entire city is hightech There are viewings and displays that employ the latest tech in presenting the visitors the look and feel of what happened during a particular battle There are 510 minute video presentations Some of these are done in artistic ways to evoke feelings of commiseration from the viewers for the full sympathetic and empathetic impact Outside the memorial however the visitors can go in and out the the different type of tanks and go up the big planes that have seen wartime This is a great treat for the young and the young at heart For pen and paper game board enthusiasts that paint soldier and vehicle figures having a more tactile experience with the life size replica or real tank can bring wonder to the mind that it can take a visitor a couple of hours going in and out the tanks and ships in the courtyard of the memorial This was our second visit to this place and there have been changes to the displays and viewings At least we know that the museum is dynamic and is still relevant to visiting tourists and locals alike,"Written June 30, 2015"

5.0,The Korea War Memorial is an enormous place with a large War Museum built around it  Pros 1 If you are at all interested in the Korean War or how it led to modern South Korea this is the ONE place you should visit There is a fascinating audiovisual exhibition on the Korean War just inside the main building on the left And simply put It will explain EVERYTHING you could possibly want to know about the Korean War Youll understand How it came to happen What happened And from first principles youll understand very clearly how this has led to the modern South Korea of today Furthermore by understanding the background youll understand very clearly the current context behind the NorthSouth Korean situation And possibly its future ramifications  2 There is a wonderful outdoor exhibition as well demonstrating US and ExUSSR and Chinese military hardware from the mid 1940s onwards If you can think of a tank missile helicopter aircraft antiaircraft gun its probably here This is probably the SINGLE and most COMPREHENSIVE collection of postworld war 2 hardware in Asia In my humble opinion the only place youre going to find better is probably the Smithsonian Washington DC USA or the Imperial War Museum London and Duxford Cambridgeshire England  3 If you are interested in middleages Korea the basement is quite interesting There is a lovely replica of a Turtle Ship Geobukseon in the basement Worth visiting  Cons 1 You need to walk a little bit to get to the museum It took me about 510 minutes to find it The nearest subway station is Samgakji or Namyeong Stations 2 The military hardware is outdoors It started raining when I visited Thus I suggest you bring an umbrella or appropriate waterproofoutdoor clothes if you intend to spend much time looking at the outdoors military collection  In summary The War Memorial of Korea is probably the BEST War Museum in the whole of Asia You will not find a larger or better collection of military hardware in Asia To find better youll have to go to Washington DC in the USA or Duxford Cambridgeshire England  I spent 3 hours at the Korean War Memorial And only saw 2530 of the exhibits on offer This place is VAST You could easily spend the whole day here  To conclude if you are a family And you have a boy in your group below the age of 21 Just GO TO THE WAR MEMORIAL of Korea Your son will have more fun that the REST of your trip to Korea put together,"Written November 5, 2014"

5.0,On June 18 2014 I visited the War Memorial of Korea as part of ten week trip through Europe and Asia This site has one of the best tributes to those who participated in the socalled Korean War I was keen to see this as one of my Uncles participated but was fortunate to return home A large memorial hall lists the names of those died and offers a tribute to those who survived  I walked through the museum and looked at the indoor displays as well as numerous war machines on the grounds surrounding the building I learned that many nations supported the war effort to drive the North Koreans supported by the Chinese from South Korea,"Written September 1, 2014"
5.0,I went to this museum after looking on TripAdvisor as I had a few spare hours in Seoul Its a bit difficult to get to if your using the subways it has a bit of a walk but its worth it When you approach it you can almost feel all of the history immediately the front of the museum is absolutely huge and there are some really meaningful statues at the front particularly the one of the 2 soldiers from each side of Korea hugging you can see the desire for peace The walls entering the museum are inscribed with all the names of the fallen soldiers throughout the 50 odd years of war between the 2 sides There are some truly good and informative exhibits and displays throughout the museum and the path it takes you on is done in chronological order so it allows you to encompass the whole timeline of war I felt I had a much better understanding of the conflict after looking around Theres also really good interactive exhibits with projections and simulations Its really well done and worth a look around if your in Seoul There is also a lot of commemorative displays relating to South Koreas involvement in the UN and other projects where they have provided assistance its really interesting Make sure you go and see this,"Written September 1, 2014"
5.0,This may be one of the best museums that I have ever been to anywhere The museum presented the history of Korea over the past 200 years adequately and thoughtfully and there was a large supply of exhibits and weaponry to make it interesting All of the exhibits were also in English This is a must see in my opinion,"Written August 31, 2014"

5.0,Went to this War Memorial after seeing listed on trip advisor and was very impressed Spent over 3 hours and could have easily spent longer They have a large area full of planes tanks boats and other military equipment that you can see up close and even climb inside some of them  The indoor exhibits of the Korean War and other historical Korean wars are well done They have english speaking tour guides volunteers so no tip needed and english explanations on most of the plaques There are also several honoring and thoughtful memorials to fallen soldiers  There are several 3D or 4D films  but be aware these run basically on the hour or half hour from 9 to 5 and have limited seating so it may be difficult to catch all of them depending how long you stay,"Written August 30, 2014"
4.0,Went to the memorial unsure of how it would be Very good exhibits showing history of wars in Korea with nice mix of historical archivesanalysis and big war toys like tanks and planesWas surprisingly interesting and good for a couple hours We didnt take one but English tours are available One downside very limited air conditioning adn the place gets hot in summer,"Written August 25, 2014"
4.0,It is a very detailed museum and with alot of things to see and do With plenty of photo opportunities on the outside and detailed galleries inside it is worth going to You will learn not only about the Korean war but some early Korean history and a fair bit on the UN as well,"Written August 25, 2014"

4.0,After a long day on a DMZ tour we decided it best to take in the museum for even a short time otherwise we may have missed the opportunity altogether I was pleased we did A museum more than a memorial it has something for everyone The inside of the museum while having quite a few cultural exhibits mainly covers the Korean War The interactive and multimedia exhibits are excellent and are available in English Unfortunately we were a little late arriving to seetry many of them My wife and I wandered around aimlessly for a couple of hours so I suggest you arrive early enough to make use of the volunteers  The outside of the museum is a boneyard of old tanks planes guns boats and all manner of other war machinery Being able to climb in and around this equipment is a delight for adults and children alike In contrast the statues and memorials you pass outside the museum is a poignant reminder that this is a memorial to those who served and died during this conflict  If you have time I suggest you allow four hours to appreciate this impressive site,"Written August 22, 2014"

3.0,I was impressed with the well thought architecture the meticulous effort in detail and variety of displays of the Korean war and the informative history of the Korean warfare I could feel a sincere homage paid to UN forces that helped defend South Korea  However it could have been better if it also showed more about North Korean and Chinese young souls who were dragged into the war at the time of emerging Cold War era and it should have been millions of civilian victims and divided families that must be in the center of focus in the tragedy instead of glorifying war heroes  It is more of a museum for war heroes and less of a memorial for war victims,"Written August 21, 2014"

3.0,We came expecting a poignant memorial to the Korean war It is not this at all and if I was reviewing it was a memorial I do not think it is very good at all This is a museum dedicated to the Korean War  Outside the memorial there are plenty of military planes tanks and missiles This sums up the internal exhibits It is a subjective look at the war You do learn a lot about a war that was effectively a world war one that killed millions in just 6 months and then another million in the two years of negotiations  Other exhibits include a military look at Korean History with dioramas There are free guided tours where the volunteer can explain the Korean War in detail We were lucky and had a History student who was able to discuss the political discourse with us  The one area that was dedicated to peace seemed very tacky to me and I felt it didnt commemorate the memory of those who died It was a room with faux tombstones that had battles projected on to them  If you come expecting a museum of war then this is a good place to spend a few hours learning a bit about the Korean war If you come expecting a museum of peace and commemoration then like me you will be disappointed I do think it was a bit too brazen and glorified the fighting a too much but then most museums about war seem to  It is free and is close to the subway You just need to walk around the American base to get here,"Written August 8, 2014"

5.0,Very informative with lots of awesome artifacts I tried my luck and asked if there was any guided tour in English The counter staff assigned a 14 year old schoolboy volunteer to bring me around Really thankful for that It took about 30 minutes and i found out that he was actually on school vacation but he signed up as a Englishspeaking museum guide on his own Good lad After the tour i went back in for a 2nd look as i wanted to take photos  Tip  1 If you have limited time your itinerary should be 2nd floor Korea War then 3rd floor UN then on to the 1st floor Medieval warfare  2 If you arrive late in the day the outdoor display of war machines should be viewed last as they are outside the museum So in the event of the museum closure you can still venture outside among the machines The highlight for me was the replica I think of a Scud missile,"Written August 4, 2014"

5.0,This place is massive Its also part museum along with being a memorial And its free I was recently at the USS Arizona Memorial and while that was very personal being from America I thought the Korean War Memorial was much more thorough  Outside there are number of statues and memorial that are very well done They also have one of the largest collections of war equipment tanks planes artillery etc that Ive ever seen Also on the outside are walls filled with names of people that died during the war What I found unique is that not only do they have the names of Koreans but also people from other countries that served during the war  Inside they have a multilevel building with extensive information on the war and some early Korean history There were a number of short films some said 3D and 4D but unfortunately I didnt have enough time to view any of them Most of the signage was also in English which was very nice They provide guided tours in a few different languages including English  I could have spent 4 hours here but unfortunately only had about 25 hours If youre the kind of person that stops at almost every display and watches every film make sure you allow for several hours or you will end up missing a lot,"Written July 21, 2014"

4.0,The whole monument and the museum serves to remind us about the great service done by soldiers not only of Korea but also of various other countries All the names are etched in the memorial and glorifies them for eternity The museum has a lot of documents medals uniforms weapons used scale models of vehicles ships and airplanes and also many full size models It is beautifully maintained and entry is free of charge,"Written July 19, 2014"
5.0,First of all its free of charge The first time we came here we had very short of time however we found it very intresting and decided to go back the next day The museum is focused on the korean war but also features exhibitions about Koreas earlier wars with Japan The korean warexhibition was really fascinating and thrilling and divided into three parts room 12 and 3 I learned alot I didnt know before,"Written July 18, 2014"
3.0,I find it curious that the War Memorial of Korea is the top attraction for Seoul It is free and it does have interesting bits but top attraction for the average visitor  Anyway the War Memorial is house in a very large building within a large park One side of the park is full of vintage tanks and aircraft There is a patrol boat in a pond which is quite impressive in the sense that its hard to figure out how they got the boat in a pond in the middle of Seoul  The main building has several levels The main level is dominated by a big room dedicated to those who died in battle The lower level has a brief military history of Korea from Paleolithic to end of the Korean Empire told through battles which must be obscure to all but the specialists  The greatest amount of space in the rest of the building is taken up by the details of the Korean War which must represent more than half the museum The section on all those countries those that contributed to the UN forces was done very well The role of the modern Korean military and the Korean defense industry wraps up the exhibition  Overall it is worth a visit and you do see some interesting stuff but on the whole the curation was not very clear and I had trouble trying to see a coherent theme I think it must be difficult to curate a war museum designed for both locals and visitors especially if the visitors are from nations who were how shall we say involved in those wars but now are major trading partners,"Written July 17, 2014"

4.0,We spend a full morning here The museum is free though you can spend an hour outside looking at the massive array of statues and military vehicles on display  There are a couple of food courts one inside the main building and one around the corner near the wedding hall  The only thing that marred this visit were the hundreds of high school students wreaking havoc all over the grounds It looked as if the teachers just turned them loose and went to go hide somewhere for the day They were smoking in the bathrooms running around putting on makeup in the POW exhibit  all kinds of crazy disrespectful stuff  Maybe time your visit after peak field trip hours or on the weekend and you will experience a very thoughtful somber museum  as it was intended,"Written July 2, 2014"
5.0,Husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this museum The indoor museum had more than just exhibits on the Korean War There were war exhibits from Koreas medieval period as well The corridors with lists of names of soldiers who died in the Korean War were well laid out and had a sense of serenity to it The outdoor museum was where the display of military vehicles was located You are allowed to see the displays up close and even explore the insides of some of the vehicles Even though I am not Korean and not a warmilitary enthusiast I found this place thoroughly enjoyable and is an honorable tribute to the fallen soldiers  My only regret was not getting to the museum earlier We arrived about 2 hours before closing time and had taken our time in the memorial corridor looking at the names of soldiers Hence we were unable to cover all floors of the indoor museum before closing time In hindsight we should have gone straight to the indoor museum and covered that first since we were able to take our time looking at the outdoor exhibits after museum closing time,"Written July 2, 2014"

5.0,I love history I have always loved history When I was a student in elementary and high school I always dedicated extra time to my history books; I wanted to understand why things are the way they are While studying abroad in college I found it fascinating that other countries tell the same story but with a different perspective After that revelation I have always enjoyed my history books in foreign countries and in foreign languages and learning new things about any given event It is fascinating to read about the SpanishAmerican war IN SPAIN And it seems an alternate universe to read about the USA in any given European Asian or Latin American country Thus I was prepared for revelations and new information the moment we entered the facility First the museum is free to all visitors; second it is a selfguided tour; you take a brochure and map and view things at your own pace The light and sound shows are well done and not overly exaggerated which would have reduced their message There are a couple that require a minimum of 5 people to begin We missed a couple because we were just 4 people  A word of caution however this museum is about all Korean wars not just the last one You will spend some time in 5th century feuding kingdoms see the play off between the Tang dynasty and Japan and the Mongol hordes over the next thousand years What once were 3 kingdoms with double the land area eventually contracted to one kingdom near the end of the 19th century before the Japanese invasion And then finally the full thrust and import to foreigners the events leading up to and including the Korean war 1950 to 1953  We all learned as high school students that the rapid removal of American troops and Secretary Achesons definition of Korea as outside the American defense perimeter after World War II contributed to the boldness on the part of the north to launch the war We didnt learn that North Korean leadership asked for permission from both the Soviet Union and China before launching their attack on the south and other interesting facts that did not come to light until after the collapse of the Soviet Union opened all those secret archives But the most interesting points to me were the minor one off events that became determining points in the war What if the ROK forces had not blown up the bridges over the Han River halting the Norths Russian tank advance for 6 days time enough for Truman to get troops to territory still held by ROK forces What if MacArthur had not gambled on a surprise landing at Incheon leading to the collapse of North Korean supply lines and the rapid retreat of the invasion force all the way back to the Chinese border What if the Chinese hadnt been so worried about an American ally on its border and hadnt entered the war What if Truman had authorized use of the ABomb So many what ifs to consider a dedicated student of history will find many such small but highly decisive events to ponder  I highly recommend this museum They say history is written by the victors and in the same way a people tell of their successes they often gloss over their failures and their shames I respect the Korean people immensely for coming to grips just over 10 years ago with the infamous 1950 summer of terror for not whitewashing what happened during that early tragic phase of the war Unfortunately I did not find that reference at this museum,"Written June 26, 2014"
5.0,Other Korean history museums seemed to gloss over the split with N Korea This was the one place that clearly explained it to us My wife didnt want to go She thought it would be a boring downer But it turned out to be a fascinating and wellillustrated explanation The memorial statue outside of two embracing brothers is quite moving The place is huge but you can certainly skip the overly detailed stuff As long as youre interested in global politics and history its easily good for a 90minute to 2hour visit,"Written June 24, 2014"

5.0,I was skeptical about visiting the War Memorial of Korea because my previous trips to similar sites in other countries had proved a real downer Usually war memorials tend to be drab and lonely places that people just pass by without so much as a glance I am happy to say the War Memorial of Korea is nothing like that When I went in late morning it was full of Korean teenagers dressed up for photos and plenty of tourists just enjoying the day The memorial consists of two parts The military equipment on display outdoors and the memorial itself with inscriptions honoring the soldiers For me the more interesting part is the outdoors one There you get to see a vast array of tanks artillery aircraft missiles and even a real patrol boat It is every boys grown mens dream come true There were descriptive and sometimes amusing information in English for the hardware which spanned periods from World War II to more recent times Where else can you see a North Korean spy submarine up close The main memorial building was not that interesting to me as the inscriptions were in Korean It had a solemn and reverent air about it to instill that sense of gravitas I made a quick walk through The memorial is highly recommended not only to see the military weaponry but also to catch a glimpse of Koreans young and old hanging out among the memorials impressive monuments and rest areas,"Written June 9, 2014"

4.0,This memorial is comprehensive assembly of the military history of Korea and tribute to the veterans The best parts of the museum are those devoted to the Korean war At times I wish it had gone deeper into the history and the sequence of battles You can spend about as long at the museum as you like if you really dig into all the stories and testimonies That said sometimes those testimonies are shallow and lack detail Some knowledge of the sequence of the battles in the Korean war certainly helps one to appreciate the different displays It is a bit disjointed in its presentation in that some parts seem to be chronologically out of sequence You do get a real sense of the feeling of violation to be invaded by a hostile neighbor and the sacrifice that was made which at times appeared to be a losing cause fortunately it did not end that way In that sense the memorial is an effective tribute Outside it has a very extensive collection of military hardware including tanks and aircraft This site is easily reached by subway and food is available on site,"Written May 26, 2014"

5.0,An excellent museum well laid out you need to allow at least a couple of hours if you want to do it properly It gives you a good insight into koreas war torn past and the suffering of the people Its free to get in and outside there is plenty of war machinery for kids young and old to climb over,"Written October 30, 2013"
5.0,While there are other exhibits in this museum the bulk of it deals with the Korean War Obviously this was a huge event for Korea and you wont find a more in depth presentation than its home country Of particular note are the various displays of the countries that helped SKorea repel the NKorean invasion as well as various dioramas and exhibits detailing the weaponry battles and equipment  To get to the memorial I believe you get off at Itaewon and look for the exit for the War Memorial Once you pass a Korean military facility youre on the right track Admission is free and I really think this is a must see for anyone interested in military history,"Written October 26, 2013"

5.0,I had the pleasure of visiting this museum during my twoyear tour to Korea This museum is phenomenal I cannot tell you how many times I was moved to tears by this place The history here is rich and very sad One country torn in two by foreign entities and forced to fight each other brother on brother Families were ripped from each others arms cities were leveled and peace was never achieved The stories that come out of this museum are powerful especially the story of the two brothers Anyone who visits Korea MUST visit this museum It is located in Yongsan it is quite easy to reach by train and cab,"Written October 22, 2013"
5.0,Im not really a museum person but this museum is incredible Every exhibit is so wellcrafted that even the most unenthusiastic visitor will be interested There are interactive exhibits videos walkthrough lifesize reenactment rooms with flashing lights and explosion sounds and even 4D rides Every exhibit video and experience has perfect informative Englishnone of that shortened Engrish we see so often in other museums  The 4D experiences were my favorite part of the museum and very kidfriendly In addition to being immensely entertaining they were also surprisingly informative The Operation Chromite experience is the most fun explaining the Battle of Incheon Theres another experience not 4D where viewers watch a short film about the harsh winter marches while the room gets cold and fake snow falls Bring a jacket  Even with all the interesting and fun bits the museum still manages to impart the somber and sometimes horrified feelings of the Korean War That said some parts do seem very propaganday so dont be surprised if your kids walk out saying they want to join the South Korean army,"Written October 21, 2013"
4.0,I found the war memorial very informational with pictures documents artifacts scaled models etc It has a large section on the Korean war but also many of the wars that happened before that You could spend hours going through the exhibits and learn a lot about the history of Korea  I would highly recommend anyone who visits South Korea to visit the war memorial,"Written October 20, 2013"

5.0,My wife  I visited the Korean war memorial  the first thing that you see is the monument dedicated to the soldiers of the conflict To either side of that monument is two statues reflecting some scenes of the conflict I found the place very quiet which is a chance to remind yourself how destructive  futile wars are on both sides Once you walk across the large courtyard into the building there is several options inside to visit As you enter the building the main Korean War section is on your left  that is very well documented  gives a concise explanation on how the conflict evolved There are several other exhibitions at the War Memorial  if you have the time it is well worth having a look at them Entrance is free As you exit the main complex there is a exhibition of helicopters airplanes tanks  boatsships used in the conflict They are in good order  whilst Im not a fan of war machinery I do like aircraft  you can get up close  check out the cockpits  workings of the aircraft A bit like the PIMA museum at Tucson Arizona You can use the city tour bus to get there or use the public transport  get of at Samgakji,"Written October 19, 2013"

5.0,Recently visited the War Memorial of Korea and came away mightily impressed with everything that was put up here This is easily a top attraction in Seoul and highly recommendable not just for military buffs but also for those interested to know more about the separation of the North and South Koreas It is also a very childfriendly attraction Of course the outdoor exhibition area with the warship aircraft and armored vehicles etc should not be missed but there is also plenty to appreciate in the exhibition halls that require a good investment of time  Visited on a Saturday and thought the crowds were manageable It was quite bustling with a music concert in the Peace Plaza front of the building as well as a small classical concert in the Memorial Hall  There is so much to love about this attraction which not only gives a touching tribute to those who lost their lives for Korea but also succeeds to inform visitors about the countrys military history There are poignant monuments about which are worth seeing The entrance through the side galleries have walls inscribed with names of the fallen while there are other various symbolic works inside the exhibition area The historical information and war memorabilia seem comprehensive and not only covers the war between the Koreas but also wars dating back to the dynasties Displays are wellspaced and the route is marked and has a nice flow and there are a variety of historical items paintings dioramas and interactive media to keep one moving while the captions are kept short but substantial Occasionally there were points that were repetitive but this only served to reinforce the information presented  Some tips  How to get there Samgakji Station Line 4 or Line 6 Exit 12  The memorial is open from 9am to 6pm and closed on Mondays except public holiday and closed the day after a Monday public holiday  Admission is free This attraction runs on donations and visitors are welcome to use the donation boxes for this purpose  Be sure to grab a brochure at the entrance which has summaries of each section and all you need to explore the Memorial  Free baby carriagewheel chair for use  Photography is allowed in most areas save for the 3D4D presentations  The 3D4D presentations run every 30minutes and tend to be popular but have limited seats which could be a problem during weekend visits  The website has a good amount of information and could help prepare for a visit here such as targeting items or areas of interest  The War Memorial of Korea is truly worth at least 3 hours but you could easily spend more if you have the time Its grand scale reflects the importance of wars in the history of this country while befitting the great significance placed on those who died to make the Republic of Korea what it is today,"Written October 18, 2013"

3.0,I spent some time at the memorial in preparation for my trip to the DMZ While the building and the displays were impressive the loud and rowdy school kids on their field trip made the experience less enjoyable Seriously where were the adults supervising the students They were running around knocking things over and talking during the movie presentations While I understand that they are kids this place is also a memorial to the soldiers of the Korean War The staff should enforce more decorum among its visitors out of respect The English tour guide was friendly but his English was difficult to understand so I left the tour group half way through and just explored on my own Overall a nice memorial and museum and I learned a lot about the war I would suggest maybe going on a weekend when there wont be so many students,"Written October 15, 2013"

4.0,Perhaps it is because technically the country is still at war with the North that the museum seems so alive and pertinent  Lots of planes and tanks to climb over or into which provide interest for those of an academic bent or for kids enjoying the thrill of getting close up to big machinery  Inside the exhibits offer a sense of a long history served in an entertaining manner with lots of audio visual displays  A real surprise and a suitable day trip for the family,"Written October 10, 2013"
5.0,I think I make time to stop by here whenever I visit Seoul If you are interested in Korean history this is a mustsee place along with the National Museum in Seoul  There are nice sculptures around the premises and the facilities are well maintained and clean They even have lockers near the inside entrance across from the bookstore and cafe I think the lockers were free Admission is usually free as well  If youre the type who likes to read and soak in everything you will need a good 23 hours to see most of the displays It will benefit you if you can read Korean though as most of the exhibits have little English descriptions a few didnt have any English The film rooms were interesting with informative documentaries again most are in only spoken Korean though  It will definitely give you a better understanding of why Koreans think the way they do when you see how the country has frequently been wartorn throughout its 5000 years of history,"Written October 10, 2013"
5.0,this was about 30 min cab ride from downtown Seoul gangham area and it was worth the ride  first it was free admission running on donations The amount of items here is just mind boggling It was really great to see planes such as B52 tanks and helicopters that were used in the war  I spent a good 4 hours here and left satisfied You could easily spend all day here  If you had family that passed in the war there is nice memorial in the front of all members KIA from all countries  The amount of information given really put the war in perspective,"Written October 8, 2013"

5.0,War Memorial Museum is a big museum with several indoor areas divided in other thematic eras of the korean history and an outdoor area filled with gigantic war machines including a full scale american B52 bomber Best of all it is free to get in except any temporary exhibit that might be happening there too  I liked very much the whole place and left there with a new understanding in a South Korean point of view about the various wars that Korean has been in their warrior and pride of identity and for sure an everlong will to be reunited with the North  A must do when in town,"Written September 12, 2013"

4.0,As an American who knew very little about the Korean War this was a very educational experience The museum talks about all of the wars on the Korean peninsula over the past several centuries but has a much larger focus on the Korean War of the early 1950s The museum is well laid out and gives a good overview of the wars There was even a 3D motion simulator movie showing you what it would be like in a fighter plane of the time Outside of the museum there is a large collection of airplanes helicopters tanks and other military equipment used in the Korean War I learned a lot about the war here and Im very happy I took the time out of my vacation to visit,"Written September 3, 2013"

5.0,Very large and interesting museum It gives an overview of the military history of Korea and focuses specifically on the Korean war of the 50s The suggested visiting time of 12 h as stated in Tripadvisor is far from sufficient in my opinion If you want also to experience the 4D movies and interactive parts of the museum you will need much more time as all these things are on the same time schedule at 30 minutes interval Therefore you will need several hours just for those parts Tips  if youre low on time start with the movies and interactive parts as soon as you get in  Take note of the fact that the interactive parts are not available from 12h00 till 13h30  Do not forget the outside it is not on the map,"Written September 2, 2013"
5.0,I am so glad we went here This is the equivalent of the Vietnam Korea and WWII memorial in DC mixed in with a military armament museum The plaques for the fallen listed by nationality and even States in the case with the US; seeing all those lost souls names inscribed under the UN banner really makes you appreciate what the world can do right when we come together Those brave men and women gave their lives for something greater than themselves or their nation Wow just amazing The statues and memorials are well done and give you the feeling of how hard Korea has had it They trace the history of this war torn country and walk you through today The building itself is an appropriate tribute but then they added so much military hardware you can spend days looking at this equipment One of my favorite parts was the north Korean equipment provided by Russia and China Makes you realize that when there is war there is usually only 2 sides; but in reality the sides fighting are usually a proxy for those countries supplying the arms Much of the information presented is in English If in Seoul and you have any interest in how Korea came to be; this is a must see,"Written August 30, 2013"
4.0,The huge ground displays statues boats airplanes and helicopters which look very captivating Utilizes their grounds well as they provide outdoor and indoor exhibits Landscape of the place is well kept Benches seating areas are provided in the grounds Vending machine is visible outdoor  Admission to this place is free English tour is provided Devout couple of hours to tour the place as it is interesting and informative utilizing multimedia short films of 510 minutes display of war remains with English translation pictures and life size statues  Recommending this as one of the place to visit when in Seoul for all ages,"Written August 28, 2013"
3.0,Im still not sure how i should think about it It is a giant building which is even of architectural views interesting Also there is an impressive collection of planes and tanks as well as a ship But in the end it is about war and i really missed the part where they tell how much the people suffer in the war Dead and shortages are big part they left away and it seems that this glorifies the war,"Written August 28, 2013"
3.0,This is an essential place to visit to understand Koreas history of warfare including but not limited to the Korean War However while everything is here somewhere it it poorly laid out and signposted We struggled to find the 3rd floor Combat Room which claims to offer some sort of lifelike experience but this 5 minute experience was underwhelming to say the least  particularly when you think about how special effects are used today in cinema and games  and the same general criticism can be levelled at many of the exhibits which seem rather dated Best is the contemporary footage from the Korean war Our visit was not helped by Seoul Councils decision to turn off the ac in its public buildings to save electricity  this just made the place even more stifling inside than it was outside,"Written August 28, 2013"
5.0,If you are minimally interested in History particularly postWWII history this place is a must It houses an amazing collection of items from the Korean War maybe one of the only moments were the cold war actually went pretty hot and also has a quite interactive way of telling its story Everything is at least bilingual KoreanEnglish though most of the exhibits also have Chinese and Japanese versions There are a couple of 4D cinemas; and displays of actual tanks airplanes missiles and other war crafts which make the visitors feel the war much more realistically And all of this for free though make sure to buy some little souvenir or donate some money These guys work hard and provide an amazing service,"Written August 27, 2013"
5.0,My goal was to spend two hours here I ended up staying four and could have absolutely done more The english speaking tour was one of the most impressive and informative tours I have ever been on Humor insight and it was obvious how much this man cared about this country Even if you dont get a chance to go into the musuem the outside planes and statues are worth the stop Do not miss this,"Written August 26, 2013"
3.0,I unfortunately could only get to the memorial on a Monday when the museum is closed I did see the exterior exhibits I found the display unordered with only very basic English explanations The Korean could have been more detailed The exhibition includes quite a few aircraft tanks some missiles and AA guns and some other heavy military equipment unfortunately the exhibits look deteriorated and dirty I did enjoy some of the impressive statues In short if you have the time and enjoy this kind of attraction you should put the memorial somewhere on your list of sites to see in Seoul,"Written August 26, 2013"
4.0,Really pleased that we went to visit this national memorial It was a great tribute to the Korean people and was very balanced in presenting the South Korean perspective of a divisive war  Certainly worth a visit if you are in the area,"Written August 22, 2013"
5.0,You will learn more about the war that isnt taught nor told in America as it really was and still is The memorial documents that it was an acted out conflict between the US and Russia and Korea was split without their say or input After 3 years of war South Koreans were dissatisfied with the division and wanted to go all the way as to ride it out to keeping the country One Other interesting exhibits are uniforms from foreign officers who ended up in Korea during the late 19th century Knowing from visiting HaemiEupsa that Catholicism was brought to Korea in the late 19th century this correlated with military history of Britian America Spain and a few other Western countries visiting Korea proposing trade relations There are also really cool medieval times exhibits that give you a sense that Korea and most of the world were at the same level of technology which still is The only differences are food language and customs as well as military and political situations,"Written August 22, 2013"
5.0,If you love history this place is amazing Great displays easy to read very logical order to the displays The 4D presentations are really good Wish i had more time to spend here,"Written August 21, 2013"
5.0,Like many of the other reviews mention this is a free museum other than some seasonal special exhibitsas but you can give a donation when you enter Outside there way quite a collection of military vehicles including tanks helicopters large aircraft and more  The inside of the museum was equally as interesting and certainly added a new or rather deeper vantage point than any textbook from school I remember There are tonnes of displays with accompanying English descriptions All very well organised and enjoyable to walk through  There are several free short 3d films that can be watched each lasting about 10 minutes or so As well as some other activities to participate in and photo spots  I only spent about two hours there which really isnt enough time to absorb everything If youre really understood in history then it could easily eat up a majority of your day,"Written August 20, 2013"

3.0,In order to remember the Korean War and commemorate the war heroes the War Memorial of Korea was established It is a museum that houses various records of the war It also serves as lessons from the war to stimulate patriotism and military spirit amongst the Korean  The museum consists of both indoor and outdoor exhibition areas The indoor ones provide visitors a glimpse into the activities during the Korean War while the outdoor ones have memorial statues and military vehicles  More on blog post httpwwwkenwooicom201307warmemorialofkoreahtml,"Written August 12, 2013"
4.0,So off the bat the outdoor display of military hardware is most impressive and would Wow any little boys or grown men who are into that stuff We spent a little while perusing the tanks planes missiles etc Then we moved inside Huge building The huge open space in front of the building devoid of any greenery reminds me of the grounds of the palaces we had visited the previous days I think Koreans just seem to love that grand sweeping open space to show case the main act  the building itself Hence no trees shrubberies or flowers in the immediate front of the building to distract ones eyes The museum have exhibits of Korean military history that goes back very far  like to 900 AD or maybe even further back As far as they have records of I guess Of course back that far it wasnt Korea as we know it today The land mass that is modern day N  S Korea hosted various kingdoms and fiefdoms whose borders fluctuated and changed many times You also get the sense that the official narrative wants to put a very proud and positive spin on Korean military achievement As with the various other museums we went into prior to this one the Koreans are not so great with putting any of the accompanying texts displayed in English Which is frustrating and perplexing since one would think that they would jump at the chance to educate visitors on their rich history  culture Instead one is left feeling very blah about whatever potentially interesting things we might be viewing since we have no idea what it is or its significance The English when there is any would be like 2 sentences long and then the Korean part would be whole paragraphs long  erm I think theyre saying way more than the English translation here Surely they can hire someone who can translate this stuff Anyway this might have been 5 stars if it wasnt for the lack of English in the exhibits Same goes for all the museums in Seoul that we went to,"Written August 9, 2013"

4.0,Decided to come here on a stinking hot day with a friend to escape outside heat and as usual with these types of places I underestimated the size of the place and spent a good few hours running around the various exhibitions exhausted  Its totally free which is always a plus and has three floors all of which are completely packed with all sorts of war things videos touch screens etc I have sort of forgotten what exactly the exhibits were but almost all of the museum is dedicated to the Korean war There is a little bit dedicated to subsequent world wars such as Vietnam and iraq etc but expect to mostly see stuff about the korean war here and be prepared to take it all in and learn about what really happened in Seoul and Korea  Some of the highlights from my four or so hours at this great venue are as follows  1 the 4d cinema which tells the story of Korea evacuating at the time Seoul was about to fall to northern Korean soldiers 2 The various interactive screens that allow you to take photos and email them to yourself 3 the outside display of aircraft such as B52 f4 phantom helicopters 4 A display that to ok place in the main courtyard of the museum which had at least 100 performers It was quite amazing as the 30 minute show started with a sword fight between soldiers dressed in those colourful and famous Korean military outfits The display then moved through the years and ended up with maching bands gunshots and a all the forces represented in a fun display At the end of the display they spent a good 30 minutes posing for photos with anyone who wanted  Overall it was an interesting experience that taught me alot about Korea and the show at the end was a highlight although I dont think the show happens every day so if you see it make sure you watch the whole thing  Plenty of bathrooms and water fountains about as well as 2 cafes that had reasonably priced food,"Written June 27, 2013"

5.0,I enjoyed the War Memorial much more than I expected As you walk to the entrance you see the names of the fallen memorialized in the walls Its always a solemn and sobering thing to remember how violent the human race can be Then you step inside and find yourself among the various exhibits chronicling Korean history The displays turned out to be quite fascinating and very detailed Even if you just spend an hour or so as we did you can come away with a full appreciation for the beauty and the ugliness that has shaped the country into what it is now,"Written May 28, 2013"

5.0,Prepare for your visit by reflecting that Korea always been threatened on the west by China and on the east by Japan a shrimp between two whales is an ancient Korean metaphor Thus much of Korean history has to do with warfare with one or both of these powers If you already are familiar with the basics of Korean history you know something of Admiral Yi Sun Shin who in the 1590s stymied Japanese invasions led by Hideyoshi in part by his revival and redesign of Koreas turtle boats the worlds first armored warships There is a scale model of a turtle boat in the museum for your contemplation Even aside from his use of turtle boats though Yi a brilliant admiral by any standard hes been compared favorably to Nelson is the preeminent naval hero of Korea But my point here is this Koreas military history is represented chronologically by statues of her heroes beginning in a circular room with statuary surrounding a huge fountain under a skylight easily the most beautiful fountain Ive ever seena shrine really so take off your hat and allow it to work its mood on you Now notice that Yi Sun Shin of the 16th Century is not even included in this inner sanctum but is relegated to the rows of statues outside leading to it This is deep history folks; about 4000 years worth of a single culture coming together out of separate and warring kingdoms Youve seen downtown Seoul Myongdong Itaewon the palaces Nam San Now devote an afternoon just a few hours to experience the roots of this magnificent country and people,"Written May 23, 2013"

5.0,I walked to the museum 1015 minutes from the Namyeong station passing the USO along the way Useful to know if you plan on doing the DMZ tour The first thing you notice are the monuments and statues outside  they really set the tone for some of the sad and poignant stories you read about inside As an English speaker I was concerned that I would become disinterested due to the lack of translation On the contrary the visitor guide outlined all the exhibits in a very clear and concise manner  with English translations though brief accompanying most artifacts The outdoor display of equipment which allows you to get up close and personal is a great way to end the tour All in all a tremendous museum and a mustsee for anyone remotely interested in military history As good as any museum youll find in London  yes im referring to you Imperial War Museum,"Written May 17, 2013"

5.0,I spent a more than three hours at this museum clearly not enough because I just had time to take a quick look at the outdoor displays where you find fighters tanks boats and even a real B52 Stratofortress  First this museum is easy to find and free of charge You can get an pamphlet in English at the entrance In case you need energy before long walking hours or a break during or after the visit you can find sanwiches and drinks in a small cafeteria The gift shop is a disappointment small and almost no books in English not even one on the Korean War  The inside exhibits are well organized easy to follow The Korean War takes a big section of two floors with key points in English photos artefacts dioramas and so on There are also an 3D movie and a shooting game which make up the fun part of the visit  Too bad that I could not take a guided tour However I was lucky to come on a Friday in May where there was a marching parade which was just awesome  If you come to visit Seoul dont miss the War Memorial Museum,"Written May 10, 2013"

4.0,All of the displays are in both Korean and English Lots of information from historical times to modern day We tried to focus on modern day exhibits as there was just TOO much to see,"Written March 14, 2013"
3.0,Probably on of the best museums youll find about the Korean War with some caveats First its helpful to know something about the Korean War before you visit Second however it may have started out this Museum is no longer completely about the Korean conflict of 195053 Third the help South Korea got from the US and the UN is somewhat understated and the focus seems to be on South Korean suffering and heroes The multimedia presentations are most all in Korean but at least they usually have subtitles  The outdoor displays are excellent but again include weapons that did not play in the Korean War  A major disappointment for me was the Dokdo display highlighting an ongoing territorial dispute with Japan Not surprising from the ultranationalistic Koreans but totally inappropriate in what should be a memorial for the thousands who sacrificed for their freedom Save your grudges for a booth at the airport Adashi  A whole section seems to be devoted to promoting the modern Korean Arms Industry Didnt detract from the visit my guests enjoyed it but Really  Do NOT expect to get a comprehensive knowledge of the Korean War from this museum  Pluses admission is free easily accessible by subway Samgakchi Station,"Written March 11, 2013"

5.0,My wife and I just came back from the Korean War Memorial The museum was closed but we were able to walk around and view the outdoor display of war machines on hand It was really good even though we were not able to enter all the exhibits so I can imagine it would be wonderful if you go and they are open,"Written February 25, 2013"

5.0,Ill be the first to admit that Im probably not the one whos been to most museums but thats mostly because most museums Ive been at have failed to catch my true interest and attention When it first occurred to me Seoul had the War Memorial of Korea I thought to myself that it must at least be very informative when looking at Koreas huge history with war  And boy it didnt disappoint  Its easy to see its very influenced by USA lets ignore that and just appreciate the depth this museum has Not only is the museum huge it covers the older wars with their neighbors but also Vietnam it even had an exhibition about the Danish contribution to the Korean wars even though it wasnt a lot IN DANISH and whatever military struggle Koreas been in and theres a lot A lot of the displays are incredibly well made and most of it is in English so you dont have to be an expert in Hangul to appreciate it At the back of the museum theyve filled the yard with military vehicles tanks cannons helicopters and planes  Impressive museum And free,"Written September 24, 2012"

4.0,Its a great way to spend a few hours and learn the history of the Korean War It was free when I went the last couple times Theyve greatly improved the area that talks about the Korean War in the museum since I first visited the museum in the 90s There is a 4D movie experience that shows how General MacArthur led Operation Chromite and its free; the drawback is that it is fairly short about 8 minutes and only 15 people can see it at a time Be prepared for a wait if you really want to see it Youre not really missing out if you dont see it Also theres a little shooting gallery that runs every so often and takes six people at a time You get 20 shots then they shoo you off,"Written September 12, 2012"
5.0,Overall this was a very good museum I was more interested in learning about the Japanese occupation of Korea This is not that so much as it is about the aftermath of Japans defeat in WWII Still there was a fun little 3D movie with motion seats in which Gen MacArthur was revealed as a brilliant strategist I never knew that but given the outcome I do thank him as do the people of South Korea I did not realize that the Korean war was ground zero at the time of the fight between communists and capitalism Very well done overall On the lower level there are minor displays of the many other invasions of Korea over the centuries with some beautiful costumes of the day Worth seeing,"Written September 6, 2012"

3.0,This is far from the 1 place in Seoul that some people say visit the National Museum of Korea well before this in other words I was in Seoul for two weeks and only got there on my last day and edited the time down to one hour The encyclopaedic coverage on level 3 of every conflict that the ROK has been involved in means it was rather militaristic from my point of view  explains why so many armed forces personnel were on visits there I guess Level 2 which deals with the Korean war is obviously the most important as earlier Korean military history receives similar but not as detailed coverage in other Korean museums Given the 60 year stand off with the North and the virtual on alert status since then of the armed forces you can begin to understand how ingrained in the Korean mind potentialif not perhaps imminent conflict is,"Written July 11, 2012"

4.0,The building is imposing along with dramatic bronze sculptures outside and acres of tanks planes ships and all the equipment of war I learned enough about the Korean conflict of the 1950s to appreciate its complexity along with now understanding the US role in how the country was divided to begin with following WWII You leave with a sense of the wars ongoing presence one section is dedicated to North Korean incursions into the South over the last 50 years This war is not yet over I was also struck with the LONG history of military conflict that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years War has shaped the Korean understanding and impacted its cultural expression for more than a thousand years We were there along with scores of school children on field trips and that moved us along a little faster than I would have liked An early morning visit would be advised Theres a nice snack bar to the right as you enter There was also a free locker to leave coats or extra items you dont want to carry through the building,"Written July 6, 2012"

3.0,The Korean War Memorial museum was an expansive and welldone grounds with 4D experience of Incheon landing I think this war needs to be remembered and would have appreciated a little more about real peoples experience It is heavily military but as a military history experience is it good I was there on a day with many elderly Koreans  and some of the men were looking at the large equipment going over every detail laughing while shaking their heads in reminiscence of what they had survived And many did not survive this horrible period of Korean history I wanted more of their story  not just weaponry,"Written July 5, 2012"
3.0,Touching visitas you walk through the corridors one can feel the massive sacrifices of men and women from all sides Once again war is ravaging and meaningless The countless battles and the final stalemate at the 38th parallel  is still plain for all to see today The exhibits are well presented  but the massive size of the hall makes the exhibits seem sparse and unconnected Perhaps I could not read Koreanand the English notices were few and did not delve deep enough to give a foreign visitor a deeper appreciation of the stories left untold One hour and I was outunlike the Imperial War Museum in London or the museums in the USA,"Written June 30, 2012"

5.0,It was a busy day when I visited but I would still probably bet I was the only person in the museum that had also visited the North Korean equivalent  The Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum in Pyongyang  It was interesting comparing the two and of course the Seoul version provides a much more rounded and historially accurate account However its possible to see propaganda from the South too  eg there are war crimes by the North documented here but the terrible atrocities committed by the South at the time are absent  Outside there are some large sculptures and quite an extensive display of military hardware from both sides as well as two of the massive loudspeaker systems used at the DMZ for psychological warfare until the operation was halted in 2004,"Written May 4, 2012"
5.0,This museum was so descriptive and extensive in their information that you get to know every little detail about it everything you wanted to know was available in English Also it was not biased towards the Koreans it was simply the best Museum and im not a big fan of Museums i would truly recommend this to anyone going to korea,"Written May 3, 2012"
5.0,The place is huge The outdoors had all the modern and old military vehicles and planes including a B52 bomber and then inside has various rooms explaing about the Korean history and the Korean war It has a restaurant which works a bit like a school canteen it was cheap but average food The place is very popular with school kids coming for excursions When we were there at 2pm Friday they performed military shows with sword battles military bands parades etc aimed for the school kids,"Written May 2, 2012"

5.0,Lots of aircraft tanks missile launchers etc on display,"Written April 25, 2012"
5.0,I took a guided tour proved in English by the museum Our guide was an older gentleman that shared his wealth of knowledge about each item in the museum As with most of Korea there is an English translation next to every item If you enjoy history and have a few hours to spare I recommend one of the tours at the War Memorial,"Written April 25, 2012"

4.0,I;m one that is not into warfare or anything related so this place was a bit depressing for me But my husband loved it It was very educational for me I learned the reason why theres a north and south korea  I learned how twisted North Koreans are  Theres a display of armory which I think guys will like,"Written April 16, 2012"
5.0,For a tourist coming from the Philippines we were in awe and amazed with the vast war memorabilia and the great display of military equipment since our own military has yet to implement their modernization program Head statues of the war heroes were displayed at the center of the building We took a photo of the rockets displayed outside since we dont have one here in our country A war ship is also on display with varied sizes of bullet dents from the enemy A big statue of brothers is at the side entrance and i think its touching to depict two brothers from two Koreas North and South meeting in a battlefield and expressing reconciliation love and forgiveness,"Written April 12, 2012"

5.0,I was really impressed with the quality of this museum The admission was free which is always nice Most of the museum focuses on the Korean War but there are also other sections explains Koreas involvement in other wars such at the Vietnam War and the Persian Gulf War The Korean War is especially interesting to learn about because it involved so many different countries who allied with South Korea The Korean War actually holds the Guinness Record for having the most allies in a single war 67 allies If you like learning about recent wars this is a definite place to visit,"Written April 1, 2012"
4.0,The Korean War sections are a little jingoistic at times but that is to be expected given the current geography and lasting memories of those terrible times 60 years ago Most of the displays are multilingual and some nice effort has gone into the AV presentations Theres more than enough millitary hardware around to keep the average 12 yr od boy or 42 yrold man in my case happy for hours and the outdoor memorials are both impressive and poignant and worth spending time viewing so wrap up warm on a cold day as its a bit exposed out there,"Written March 30, 2012"

4.0,Well done very respectfull place with a great deal of history and information I would recomend aprox 8 year old children and up for both enjoyment as well as educational value It may be a bit too advanced for the little ones however parents who know how to see an attraction on the fastrack before it becomes too tiresome for the wee ones could get through this inside of a couple of hrs if need be  Not far from central Seoul could easily be combined with other downtown sites Free attraction well worth taking a look you will not be disappointed,"Written March 29, 2012"
5.0,Had to visit the Korean War Memorial Museum as my dad fought in the Korean War Many bits of Korean War History as well as history of the the Korean War with N Korea Great displays and the Hall of Memorials to Fallen Soldiers very moving,"Written March 27, 2012"

5.0,Its a great location to go see what brought this great nation from its humble beginnings to the powerhouse it is today First the good Its not expensive and most weekends its absolutely free Tours are offered in English and other languages  if they can get volunteers The Koreans sincerely appreciated the UN help for the defense of their country and they will tell you that repeatedly The museum is laid out on the timeline prewar to postwar with a display of current weaponary the Korean Army uses today Now the bad there really isnt any downside to the museum Its located between 3 different metro lines the US base and the Korean Army HQ IPark mall is about a 10 minute walk or you can go to Itaewon 10 minutes the other direction,"Written March 16, 2012"

3.0,Impressive and moving wall of names of fallen soldiers from every country that fought to defend South Korea in the Korean War Nice lifesized dioramas of Vietnam and Korean War era involvements; left me hungry for more on the Korean War The mueum has a broad scope of Korean wartime history from ancient times to present If you want Korean culture the most interesting and informative is the Folk Museum; Korean history is in the equally fantastic National Museum; and there are specialty museums all free about King Sejong the proponent of the Hangul alphabet and about Admiral Yi who thrashed Japanese invaders with his turtle boats The war memorial is huge and has a mix of displays for all ages,"Written February 21, 2012"
4.0,as the war is part of what defines Korea the museum is central and easy to navigate Theres even a wedding hall attached where some friends of mine married   making it just that little bit of weird many of us know as only in Korea,"Written February 19, 2012"
5.0,Free entry beautiful and great for history lovers This museum takes about 5 hours to get through The highlight is the impressive outdoor display of artillery tanks battleship and aircraft Although most displays did not have English translation it was a very moving experience,"Written February 14, 2012"

4.0,I am not a history or military buff but I have visited this museum several times and always enjoy it Korean history is very long and filled with fascinating wars and military actions This museum gives a wonderful overview of it all Most of the signs are in English and there are English docents nearby to help you find your way around It is very easy to navigate through the War Museum and it never feels crowded It is vast so start early if you want to try to see it all There is usually a revolving exhibit space that shows new exhibits that are not military based if you need a break from the wars However you must pay a nominal fee for these In addition there are all manner of military machines outside for viewing Dont miss the gift shop it has some very unique and fairly priced items Several are open to exploration and the kids love that This museum is very easy to get to using the 4 or 6 subway line at Samgakji Station or the 110 bus You can walk to it from Iteawon as well,"Written February 6, 2012"
4.0,OK so I am partial to military museums because I was in the Air Force for 20 years But this one is pretty nice I was disappointed that they did not have more informaiton and history about the Korean War at least not in English but the amount of displays in the museum is really pretty good They have everything from bullets to aircraft  tanks a few boats etc Certainly worth doing Most of the museum is inside but there are some aircraft missiles and vehicles outside  so you can do this on either a nice day or a rainy day,"Written January 27, 2012"
4.0,A lot of the museum is great some is mediocre but there are plenty of different aspects of the Memorial that make it very much worth a visit As an American there is a deeper emotional attachment to the displays and information from the Korean War,"Written January 20, 2012"
5.0,Too big to see all of it in one short trip via the City Bus Tour well worth a second visit,"Written January 15, 2012"
4.0,I was hoping to learn in depth about the Korean war and ongoing cold hot war with North Korea There were good exhibits but could have been organized better There are many videos but it feels scattered and you are only absorbing the fragments of the history Also there is not much exhibits on the current status with the North I had a good time but at the same time a little disappointed,"Written January 9, 2012"

3.0,My favorite part was exploring the planes boats and tanks outside The indoor exhibits were very interesting as well but all that walking on the marble floors got to me after a while,"Written January 5, 2012"
5.0,This was an interesting 12 day out Kids should love the outside exhibts lots of planes tanks helicpoters some of which you can climb on I was surprised at the free entry also when I visited Gunther von Hagens Bodyworks was there extra cost this I really enjoyed though my husband was less keen i think the bisected head freaked him out a little though the local kids seem to take it all in their stride If you like history this should be high on your agenda as there were lots of uniforms and wepons to see and a whole section devoted to both the korean and vietnam wars,"Written January 4, 2012"

5.0,If youre new to the country this beautiful memorial is a must We spent a couple hours here over the summer and it was very moving to learn more about the history of Korea Sadly not all signs are in English  which takes away a little bit from the experience But still  the statues outside busts turtlebackship etc are out of this world I highly recommend,"Written November 20, 2011"
5.0,This museum tells the story of Korea from the perspective of wars and invasions Given how many there have been in Korean history thats pretty much all of it The parts about ancient Korean history and the warring kingdoms of mediaeval times gets a bit wearing for the foreigner; but the two top floors which are devoted to the Korean War are mustsees as are the aircraft guns and tanks on display outside the museum  As this is also the site of the Korean War Memorial the complex takes its name from that statue which is also a necessary part of any visit Allow at least a couple of hours,"Written November 16, 2011"
5.0,I recommend stopping by this place for at least an hour or two There is a quiet somberness that is reflected just like certain monuments in Washington DC There is a lot to look at while walking both inside and out  There is a big display of static aircraft and artillery with English translations as well Lots of statues and a large quiet hall with the names of lost Korean soldiers engraved on pillars While you are in Korea I really recommend taking a moment to reflect and learn more about what happened there especially since this is the most defining moment of modern Korean history,"Written November 6, 2011"
5.0,Good innovation of the museum very impressed suitable for people who are not into history and perfect for those who are into it A good place to visit with free admissions,"Written November 5, 2011"
4.0,We didnt plan to visit this museum on the first place but while reading its review here I gave it a shot on one of my free day in Seoul I like this place more than other museum in Seoul and they have real plane and ship on display The museum is located not far from the subway station only 5 min walking distant We planned to spend just couple hours here turned out we spent almost 4 hours as there are so much things to see It is a mustvisit if you come to Seoul One more thing the museum also provide free lockers,"Written November 2, 2011"
5.0,This place explains so much of Koreas past both old and recent and helps any firsttimer get a good understanding of why Korea is the way it is Even if military history isnt your bag it is worth turning up in the morning to see the guardchanging display with twirling rifles and coordinated marching But the explanation of the Korean War the very sombre plaques listing all of the dead and the mindboggling display of military hardware outside really make it a great place to spend half a day on your sightseeing agenda,"Written October 28, 2011"
4.0,We only had allocated an hour thinking this was a Memorial  it is much more of a museum LOTS of hands on exhibits both inside and out Outside had all SORTS of boats tanks planes etc on exhibit for exploring Inside several floors of really excellent exhibits Very comprehensive and made a good attempt to provided a balanced and unbiased perspective Many varied exhibits well laid out and good descriptions  Negative LOTS of screaming yelling running  pushing kids I wanted to SLAP a couple and I am usually pretty happy to see kids in a museum learning The overwhelming NOISE drove us out of a number of rooms Seemed most were unsupervised and just running wild Not sure if it was a school holiday or something but it was too much for us,"Written October 20, 2011"
4.0,The memorial has marble slabs and bronze slabs with names of the fallenimportant to remember Enjoyed seeing the early war implementsstone axes arrows heads etctransition thru the ages to use of metallater machines of warcannons etc When you grow up in the western world teachings of Asian history are limitedthus it was interesting to see the small displays of western military excursions into Korea Also interesting to learn a little about Koreas military struggles with her neighborsChina  Japan thruout the centuries Information and displays provided are brief but interesting The visit is definitely worthwhile,"Written October 15, 2011"
4.0,Interesting and want to revisit again as there is some renovation done on the compound of the museum Understand that Korea people pay high price to get the peace and learn to apprieciate peace enviroment without war Salute to all the Korean Heros,"Written September 25, 2011"

3.0,"  The sunset is a good place to take a walk while looking at the Han River. It's a perfect place for a picnic. It is a wonderful place where you can enjoy the cool river breeze and see the scenery. Events are often held here, and it's a fun place to just look at. However, it was disappointing that it was thrown out on the street or around the trash cans, either because there were a lot of people, or because there was still a lack of civic awareness to throw away garbage. Also, some cyclists were passing by at the crosswalk without stopping, just passing at a frightening speed, swearing loudly at people who would never go for a walk again, saying they were being interrupted, which was the worst. I could only take away good memories, but I don't think it can be done because of some ignorant people.   ",a week ago

5.0,"  On this hot summer day, I wonder how many more comfortable places to rest in Seoul as the Han River. The valley is nice, but access is not easy. Yeouido Hangang Park is located right in front of Yeouinaru Station on Subway Line 5. It is also possible to visit by car, but despite the large parking lot, it is not recommended because of the large number of people. Since most people come to Yeouido Hangang Park for the purpose of chimaek, public transportation is recommended. It is embarrassing to write down the messengers that everyone knows too well, but It is recommended that you come empty-handed, borrow a mat and table, get chicken delivered, purchase alcoholic beverages other than beer at convenience stores, and purchase additional food at Han River Park stalls to have fun and then return home empty-handed.  ah!! And I urge you to clean up your trash. In this way, it is convenient for other people to use it and it is possible to prevent infectious diseases caused by rats and pigeons.   ",2 weeks ago

5.0,"  The whole village is made of hanok. It is a place where ordinary people actually live. So if you talk or make a loud noise here It is a place where you have to be quiet because the residents are uncomfortable. Not the whole village, but only certain sections. Silence is required. There are guides on both sides of the entrance. You must cooperate and follow. There are two photo zones on either side of the entrance. Rickshaws running in Seoul also reach the entrance here. Please check the schedule as it operates. Usually, the section from the bottom to the top is normal. The course going down from the top is a section where you have to cross from the Board of Audit and Inspection, so you have to walk for a long time. We went from the Blue House to the Museum of Contemporary Art, then to every corner of Bukchon and to Changdeokgung Palace. It doesn't matter which way you go, but after coming over from Changdeokgung, you can see Bukchon Hanok Village and follow the road you came from. I recommend that you go back.   ",a month ago

2.0,"First off,  this place is beautiful.  The facades of the houses are genuinely gorgeous.  If you want to see traditional Korean house exteriors this is the place.  The experience is pretty lackluster though. Because it's such a tourist attraction the entire area is overpriced  and crowded with people trying to take photos and blocking all the roads.   For example a cup of coffee is 800₩ in the local cafes. That's as much as the most bourgeois coffee shops in Williamsburg or Tribeca (NYC).  To cater to the tourists there are a million boutiques selling overpriced trinkets and knickknacks, and just as many cramped cafes. There are multiple rooftop cafes thanks to the layout of this neighborhood basically being on a cliff, and that's cool,  but being jam-packed with other tourists all trying to take pictures of their 25,000₩ salads is not so nice.  Also the city apparently hires  아줌마(middle aged women)to tell tourists to be quiet. They stand around all day wearing yellow vests that say ""quiet please."" I didn't get shushed but I witnessed some Koreans getting scolded by some old lady for basically saying ""wow so pretty!"" About a view.  They just stand around scowling,  waiting for someone to raise their voice.  I was initially excited to come here and within 5 minutes I thought ""I don't know what I expected... but it wasn't this. ""  So if you want to get scolded for being a tourist and overpay for food and coffee in a very crowded but pretty urban neighborhood then you'll love this place.",a year ago

The houses are certainly very beautiful, but in the end only 2, 3 streets are interesting and allow you to admire the roofs and the walls   ",a year ago
5.0,"  Bukchon is one of the old districts of Seoul that has survived to this day. In the Joseon era, these traditional tiled houses belonged to the Korean nobility, the Yangban. Bukchon Folk Village is located adjacent to the Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung palaces and the Jongmyo royal shrine. It appeared here almost simultaneously with the founding of Seoul more than six centuries ago. The houses of the nobles in the traditional style have come down to us almost unchanged. The Center of Traditional Culture and restaurants of traditional cuisine are open here, visiting which you can immerse yourself in the atmosphere of old Korea. The area was called Bukchon, which means ""northern village"" because it is located north of Jonggyecheon Stream and Jongno Street. During the Joseon Dynasty, members of the royal family and the highest circles of the capital's aristocracy lived here. Bukchon includes Wongse-dong, Che-dong, Gahwe-dong and Insa-dong.

5.0,"  Bukchon Hanok Village is a residential area of Hanok which is the same traditional house as the one in the Joseon Dynasty era. This area is located between Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung and Jongmyo Shrine. The authenticity of the Hanok houses here is still preserved and has become a cultural center for tourists who want to get to know Korean culture more deeply. You can visit this area for free and take pictures with a cool Hanok house as a background. A little advice, if you want to come here, it's better to wear flat shoes / sandals, or sneakers, because here you will be walking a lot.  Today the traditional houses in Bukchon Hanock Village serve as cultural centers, guest houses, restaurants and teahouses. Tourists who visit have the opportunity to learn and experience Korean traditional culture for themselves. Apart from the buildings, the structure of this village is also unique. The traditional village architecture is full of charming alleyways. Walking there is like going back to the Joseon Dynasty.  Bukchon literally means ""northern village"". This district is named for its location to the north of two Seoul icons, the Cheonggye River and Jongno District. According to Confucian beliefs and pungsu, the location of this village is very strategic, which is at the southern foot of the mountain that connects the Baegak Mountains and Eungbongsan. The village is also surrounded by shady forests with beautiful panoramas. The cultural roots and traditions of this village are around 600 years ago during the Joeson Dynasty  1392-1897 . In the past, this village was only inhabited by aristocrats and their families. This is because the village is close to two city palaces. The aristocrats lived in hanok houses with unique architecture. This traditional house is complete with distinctive elements such as a long, curved roof and ondol floors to keep the house warm in winter.   ",a year ago

Few people have lived in these places, so I think that it is useful for promoting the architectural beauty of Korea's previous era both educationally.

The best way to get to Bukchon Hanok Village is from Exit 2 of Anguk Station, Seoul Line 3, Exit 3. It is easiest to find it first by coming to the place called Jeongdok Library and going along the alley. This time I went and found a map with the course of Bukchon Hanok Village. From Exit 3, they guided us to start the first start at the Bukchon Cultural Center.  Personally recommended course tips! Routes 5-6 are also good~ However, it is recommended that many foreigners go to Joongang High School located in the 2nd and 3rd locations. In addition, these days, it is a famous place for filming dramas with Jungang High School in the background. These days, the Goddess Advent appears in the background.  It's a little uphill that way   For those of you who are planning to travel to Seoul, let's briefly explain this place, The Hanok Village in Seoul has Bukchon/Gyeongbokgung Palace/Insa-dong/Unhyeongung/Donhwamun-ro/Seongbuk/Eunpyeong/Ikseon-dong. Among them, Bukchon Hanok Village is a historic area where the nobles of the Joseon Dynasty lived in Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung. Because there is Mt. Bugak, it is also good geographically.

5.0,what,7 months ago
4.0,It is the first department store in Korea recognized by the National Archives a government agency The opening date officially announced by Shinsegae is October 20 1930 which is the opening date of the Mitsukoshi Gyeongseong branch which Shinsegae claims as its roots As mentioned above the main building of the main branch is the oldest among the existing department stores in Korea dating from the Mitsukoshi Gyeongseong branch during the Japanese colonial period Because it is a building with such historical value in the early 2000s the Cultural Heritage Administration recommended that it be registered as a registered cultural property but Shinsegae refused whether there was any thought of remodeling Afterwards a new building was built at the back in 2005 and the main building was further extended in 2007 However since the Lotte Department Store head office is right across the street it doesnt feel that big Even after the new building was built it also served as the headquarters of Shinsegae Group so they didnt have enough space so they bought the Mesa building next door in 2008 and in 2015 it was built right next to the main building in 1935 I even bought the first branch of SC First Bank,7 months ago
