50,"Service was ok, you wont be expecting personal touch due to the high crowd flow. But the ginseng chicken soup was made of such a hearty broth, flavorful, perfect for cold weather. We added extra for ginseng root and it did give that extra oomph to the broth! We had the normal white chicken, not the black, it was soft and melts in the mouth. Dip it in salt and pepper and its such a wholesome meal! You can pair it with ginseng tasting liquor that elevates the experience."
30,Seafood pancake was bad. Chicken soup used to taste better pre Covid . Found it quite mediocre this time. Still could be a place to visit as a tourist if you‚Äôre here first time. Couple the trip with Gyeongbokgung visit
40,"Quaint and unique setting. The Samgyetang and roast chicken are delicious! Seafood pancake is very average. Inexpensive, worth a visit"
50,"Its the second time I come here for a reason and for sure its because its food the most amazing traditional gingseng chicken soup. On point, hearty, tasty and perfect for the cold weather."
50,You really need to visit this Restaurant when your in the city! My Friends and I had so much fun there Great Food and Drinks!
40,"Definitely a restaurant that has a high tourist intake, but the food is good and the atmosphere is pretty cool. The ginseng liquor is a fun souvenir !"
30,"Options are available for traditional sit-on-floor or table and chairs arrangement. Tell the staff upfront if you want the latter or they'll look really annoyed with you. Heard so much about this place that I had high expectations but felt let-down. Just stick to the signature ginseng chicken soup. Little difference in taste for the others. Food was good, but I couldn't understand the hype. We also ordered the Korean pancake which was also good but couldn't finish because portions were big. Worth a visit, go without expectations, and especially do not expect good service."
50,We returned here for their ginseng chicken soup since our visit 3 years ago. Their ginseng chicken soup is flavourful and full of ingredients. They are generous in their ginseng. Come after 6.30pm for dinner to avoid the crowds and long queues.
40,"nice food that foreigners should try, good taste korean food compare with other dishes. location not far from gyeongbokgung palace, about 10 minutes walk."
50,"Never like Samgyetang but this was different. The chicken was soft, though a little dry, the soup wasn't too salty which was to our liking and the ginger wasn't those that were spicy but has more of sweetness in it. Everything just blends well together. I added a little ginger alcohol thingy that they gave but prefers it without. We were actually expecting better services since it was one of the ""must-try Samgyetang"" restaurants in the area. However, the staff could be friendlier and more patient with tourist like us who doesn't understand the ordering system. What's more, we do not understand korean."
50,"There are many places to go for this dish. I have tried to find a better one than this place, but honestly, as touristy as this place is...it actually is the best. Highly recommend! Get the black chicken soup! Super healthy and super delicious!"
10,Extremely rude service and pushy. Very impatient and no customer service at all. Other than the ginseng chicken soup is good given second thought will never patronize the shop despite all the acclaimed awards. The owner should reflect on his staff attitude and not all travellers spoke mandarin are from mainland and given poor attitudes. For those travellers all the best if you do experience similar incident
50,"Came during winter  Service was fast but pushy  Malaysian's appetitie is smaller compared to Koreans. Thus we only ordered 2 bowls of Korean Chicken Ginseng Soup for sharing of 4. Luckily the waitress compromises our order of only 2 bowls as I know that we have to order 1 bowl per person in Korea and stricly no sharing.  Food wise : We thought it was only chicken and soup , the glutinous stuffed in the chicken brought us all to a surprise. The chicken was quite bland tho have to eat it with the salt provided. They provided i think it was suppose to be liquor but we didnt know whether to pour it into the soup or drink as it is.  Price wise it was kinda higher than average. But there is always a 1st to everything  **Do try it yourself and tell the tale as everyone has their own taste and preference :)"
10,NEVER GO! The worst customer service ever. The servers rolled their eyes when I asked them for anything if not outright ignored me. The food was okay but couldn‚Äôt really trust that hygiene was up to par. They also pushed customers into getting one type of dish for turnover by saying that the other takes longer.  Extortion by definition. 18 dollar for a smallest chicken I‚Äôve ever seen. I could of had the same for half the price somewhere else. Only went because my visiting friends wanted to but never going back again.
50,Came here after our visit into the palace. Immediately got some hot tea and a sodju shot - very pleasant during the cold winter day. Ate black chicken soup and seafood pancake - both were great.
40,It‚Äôs perfect meal in the winter weather while visiting the palace at Greongbokgung and Bokchon Hanok village. You get banchan to go with the ginseng chicken.
40,"There was a queue of about 10 people as we visited at around 1 pm for lunch. The line moved quite fast as the restaurant is big.  We ordered the black ginseng chicken which was enough for two people. It has all sorts of stuffing inside like rice, ginko nuts, ginseng etc. The locals seated next to us added salt and pepper to the chicken as they dine. Free side dishes (banchan) were served as usual in Korean meals. The restaurant was full with a mix of tourists and locals."
50,"It's a must eat everytime come to Seoul, even my kid she like the soup and.rice so.much...feel energy is.coming back after the chicken soup."
50,Must try in Seoul- we were skeptical at first since we thought it may be a tourist trap but turns out more than half the clientele were local and the ginseng chicken was out of this world! You have to try it and I will consider coming back to Seoul for this restaurant.
50,"Heard of this famous place - some said it was overrated, some said it's not to be missed. There was a queue when I arrived, but it was quick for my turn to be seated. It's a simple menu with their only main attraction dish - samgyetang. If you have a bigger group, you can also try out their seafood pancake. The food was good and comforting as a winter dish. It warms your tummy almost immediately. They also serve ginseng liquor together with the meal."
40,"After walking around the Gyeongbokgung Palace, it‚Äôs good to sit down and enjoy the wonderful meal to recharge our energy. We order different type of ginseng‚Äôs soup and the seafood pancake. We love it."
30,"There is a constant line of people waiting to get in. The line moves quickly and inside it is a rather big place  The two main dishes of this place are the ginseng soup chicken and the roasted chicken. Kimchis and other preserved vegetables are provided on the table in a pot. You are able to take as much as you like.  The ginseng chicken soup is rather bland, and has a slight bitter after taste, not your everyday chicken soup and might not be suitable for all.  The smell of the roast chicken makes your mouth water. However, again it's rather bland, but nothing a inch of salt would not fix.  In conclusion something that you should try once in Korea and maybe return if you like it."
20,"Very disappointing for a well known samgeyang restaurant. Guess the popularity got to its head. Gruffy service, rude replies to queries or change in the order. Will not be back."
50,The most wonderful piping hot ginseng chicken soup is a must on every of my trip to Seoul. Highly recommended üëç
20,"Our family of 10 visited the restaurant on a weekday afternoon, not too crowded, able to be seated within 10 minutes. The service was efficient, all serving staff are able to speak Mandarin eloquently. They‚Äôll give specific instructions on which plates to use to put what type of side dishes. My dad, who is 75 years old, did not manage to listen carefully, and placed the side dishes wrongly. He was immediately reprimanded by the serving staff in a very rude manner. Maybe this is cultural difference but we were certainly not used to this. Food was good though not to everyone‚Äôs liking."
20,Poor customer service as staff are rude and loud. Slow despite the not so peak time when we visited. Overrated as food is so-so and not value for money considering the food we ordered. Wouldn‚Äôt visit next time in Seoul.
50,Went there to eat in January this year and went there again in our trip this December. We order 3 portions - 1 black ginseng chicken and 2 white ginseng chicken with a seafood pancake. The chicken is so soft that it falls off the bone for eating. The soup is thick and the kimchi is very good. We bought back 1 radish and 3 cabbage kimchis from this restaurant. We have had ginseng chicken soup in other places but none beats this place so far. We were lucky to just come in before a large group came so we didn't have to queue.
40,Ginseng Chicken was good but did feel a bit touristy. Still a must try if it is your 1st visit to Seoul. Walking distance from the main antrance of Gyeongbukgong Palace.
40,We went there during lunchtime on a Wed and were surprised to find no queue. We were directed to the low table section where u take off your shoes & sit on the floor. However I requested to be seated at the regular table & chair section as it is more comfortable for us.  Food is great as usual. u have the option to add ginseng wine to enhance the flavour or drink it directly instead. The seafood pancake is also pretty good
10,"This is my 3rd time to this place and this is the first time the waitress forced us to order 5 bowl of ginseng chicken soup. There were 5 Adults and 1 child. We requested 4 bowls because we were afraid we couldn‚Äôt finish and we didn‚Äôt want to waste any food. The waitress then ran out of patience and walked away from our table. Guess what she said to us !!?? She said, call me when you‚Äôre ready. We were so disappointed with their service. The best part of all the taste of the ginseng chicken soup isn‚Äôt as pleasant as it used to be. I would strongly advice you to not come to a place as of such arrogant and bossy service."
40,Brought my mum there to eat the ginseng chicken and she loved it! Order the one with the ginseng roots and the taste of the soup was on point! Tried the seafood pancake and thought it was just ok.
30,"Below expectation and not sure if my tastebud is expecting stronger taste, so the ginseng soup feels a bit too light for me."
40,"Not difficult to find the place, though it's off the main road. May miss it if you did not look around. Service was quick after ordering. Was relatively surprised there wasn't a queue, so we got in quickly and dinner was served fast.  We only tried the original chicken soup, there were other variations like black chicken ginseng soup and a stronger version of ginseng soup. The soup is good for sharing, even though it says that it's meant for 1 person. The broth was tasty and there's glutinous rice in the soup as well, no wonder they don't serve white rice (we didn't ask for it as well). We ordered 3 soups and a seafood Pancake, shared by 4 adults and 1 child. It was very filling by the end of the meal.  It was my first time trying Ginseng wine as well, I find it rather nice, and you can purchase bottles of Ginseng wine as well."
50,I would highly recommend this to all visiting korea and looking for authentic korean food. The samgyetang was creamy and flavoursome and my friends all enjoyed it too. The design of the restaurant space was also really pretty and set in a traditional house. The walk in from the entrance was nice and the staff were friendly. 10/10 would recommend.
40,"It was a rainy, cold and wet day when we made a last minute decision to have the chicken soup. The soup was good and flavourful...... It was nice to have something hot on a cold day. The chicken was kind of tasteless, that's why the recommendation to dip into salt n pepper. We did not eat the rice that was stuffed in the chicken as it was tasteless. It was a good experience for a first timer but I probably won't want to pay that kind of money to go a second time."
40,"We walked over from our Insadong hotel early to beat the dinner crowd. We were seated immediately in a relatively empty restaurant but within 30 minutes the restaurant became full with a waiting line. Put on the map by the expresident of Korea eating here quite often for a meal the restaurant is very popular. The restaurants main dish is samgyetang, Korean ginseng stuffed chicken. There is roast chicken and a few other dishes but most sitting around you are ordering samgyetang. They do a fine job of putting a succulent chicken stuffed with ginseng and sticky rice on the table. It was well worth the walk."
40,"Very popular place amongst locals and tourists. Lots of room, though be prepared to sit cross-legged on the floor to have your food. There are other more conventional tables, but not as many. We ordered one serving of the ginseng chicken in soup (more traditional option), and also a roast ginseng chicken. Both were very good. It was a great experience. Between me and my friend, we were both well-fed! LOL!"
40,"We visited on a weeknight at 830pm and didn't have to wait for a table.  Our order: one serving of black chicken ginseng stew and an extra dish of crispy seafood pajeon/ pancake.  The chicken was served in a mini earthen pot and an accompanying shot of ginseng wine, which one would add to the stew if you liked a stronger ginseng taste. For the unacquainted, the chicken, as is, would be adequate.  As for the seafood pancake, it was loaded with ingredients but not stodgy... just the right amount of crispiness to entice you to take another bite.  Our order for the night was just the right portion for two people of moderate appetite. Might I add that the free cabbage and radish kimchi packed a refreshing punch.  This meal certainly marked a great start to 7 nights in Seoul!"
30,Went there for dinner and there was no queue at all. The price was a bit expensive and the taste was just okay. It was also not very filling as there was little chicken meat in it. I could even eat a sandwich after that.
30,"The place is comfortable, fast service with good kimchi. However we are kind of dissapointed with the #1 ginseng chicken as we have tasted better ones in smaller restaurants. We can understand the volume that they may be handling daily but it will be nice if they could focus a little bit more on customer relationship i.e. add a little smile will make a great difference to the customers."
50,"We ordered the ginseng chicken and pancake for 2 people which was more than enough food. The ginseng chicken is reminiscent of home cooking and is very comforting. There is ginseng wine which comes with it which we drank separately and is quite strong in flavor. You can also buy the wine in bottles if you enjoy it. We went mid afternoon, after lunch hour and had only a 5 minute wait."
40,"get in the back of the long line, it took use about 30 min to go from the back of the building to the entrance. the place inside is huge, all different small rooms with little ladies running back and forth with the chicken soup, menu is in English."
50,"Just order one samgyetang. It's rich and full of flavour. My favourite is the glutinous rice studying with date, chestnut and who knows what other deliciousness. The chicken has little flavour because it's all gone into the soup. Every spoonful is so rewarding."
40,Its our second time here for the fabulous food.Price is on the steep side but as always the the value offer is worth the money you pay. We highly recommended the silky fowl which is the best of all. Be there early to avoid the lunch crowd.
40,Soft and tender chicken in rich broth. We ordered roasted chicken to share too. Free flow of kimchi. Don't worry on long wait. Big place to accommodate high demand. Service is quick too!
50,"After the tour of the palace, we took a short walk to this infamous place. From afar, we could see the line out the door already. We decide to wait in line anyway as we will not be coming back to this area in this trip. Luckily, the line moves fairly quickly. I think we have waited less than 10 mins. The place is very clean and organized. Menu is limited - we ordered two ginseng chicken - one black and one white. Seafood pancake. Plenty food to share among 4 of us. We still have leftover!! Love the black chicken soup. The BEST one we had in this trip. Would go back again for sure in our next trip!!!"
50,"It is not easy to locate Tosokchon. It is in an alley. From Gyeongbokgung Station Exit 3, cross the road and head towards convenient store GS25.Once at GS 25, turn into the alley. It is next to GS 25. Expect a queue but it will clear fast. Once in the restaurant, service is brisk and efficient. Help yourself with kimchi and preserved radish as much as you wish. Minimum price for Samgyetang is 18000 won. Best is still the 24000 won Ginseng Chicken soup with wild ginseng roots (in a small bottle). When added to the soup together with the ginseng wine served in a small cup, it makes the soup very flavourful and super-nice. It really brings the soup to a whole new level. The 15000 won seafood, green onion pancake we had was surprisingly very good. It went well with the vinegar sauce which come with it. It is really not for those who do not eat spring onions, in conclusion, it is worth the queue."
20,"REASON FOR VISIT: so this place seems to feature in all the guides and every website about Seoul and yet we really didn't like the food that much. We were taken here by our local Korean friend.  FOOD: So basically you eat a stuffed chicken in a soup. Yes it's an entire chicken per person but it's more of a baby chicken. The chicken is stuffed with rice inside which we didn't really get, especially because then the rice dissolves in the soup... Overall it simply tasted a bit simple and lacked some flavouring.  It was also fairly expensive in our opinion compared to other meals we had in Seoul. Although it was authentic Korean, it just wasn't very satisfying.  STAFF/SERVICE This place is like a machine, people are constantly in and out. The restaurant is huge, must be able to serve at least 200 people at the same time. The staff are fairly rude, not interested in coversing and clearly don't speak English.  ATMOSPHERE/LOCATION Extremely busy restaurant with people clearly coming on their lunch break. Location is practical, very close to one of the main palaces which makes it practical to come to.  CONCLUSION: I DO NOT RECOMMEND AND WOULDN'T RETURN"
40,"Went as solo traveler at off peak lunch hour. Staff guided me to a table that is more secluded, so I felt quite comfortable eating by myself. Ginseng chicken soup was really flavourful and rich with ingredients. Service was okay. Overall it was good experience. Recommended for other solo travellers."
40,"We reached an hour before closing time. No queue like during day time and dinner time. Ahjumma welcomed us to sit. We ordered 1 pot of black chicken samgyetang to share.  We had enjoyed our samgyetang in Busan in May. This one has a nutty flavour, not strong in ginseng flavour or masked by the nuttiness. I enjoyed the chicken meat with cut garlic.  A nice warmth in the tums as we walked into autumn night."
40,"There‚Äôs the option of the usual chicken or black chicken if you prefer. They serve the soup with a small cup of ginseng wine, for the non-alcoholics, you may put this into the soup for added flavour."
30,The restaurant is easy to find and the staff are very swift to guide you to a seat. The ginseng chicken soup is delicious but not particularly amazing? The kimchi omelette was yummy too.
40,It is the first time to try Ginseng chicken soup. The restaurant is looked nice. Staff are friendly and warm welcome. Please try!!
50,"A wide range of ginseng chicken for you to choose at different budgets. Generous portions, can be shared for small eaters together with a side order. Free flow to side dishes like kimchi."
50,The soup is quite good and tasty. This is also healthy because containing ginseng. You can find the place in the left side of Gyeongbokgung Palace. The place is quite small from the front side but wide inside.
40,"This is the must-go place for warm soft yummy ginseng chicken soup. The broth is just nice not too think and not too bland. The chicken is tender, even breast meat is soft and juicy. The side dishes of kimchi and radish is also very yummy so mix it with the glutinous rice in the bowl and you get a very satisfying meal ! Don't expect much from the servers though, the ajummas are generally quite grouchy."
30,"for me the taste lil bit salty, and the food is pricey compare to the same menu in other restaurant."
40,"We came here before 12:00 and the line wasn‚Äôt long. It took us over 5 mins for getting a table. We order 1 signature ginseng chicken soup and 1 pancake for 2 of us. - Soup: not really spiced but it was good. Can felt the real taste of chicken broth and ginseng. Chickens were tender. Like healthy food. - Pancake: quiet big, taste was accepted, better go with kimchi.  *Price: affordable"
20,"The waitress was rude to us, we only ordered one because we afraid we cant finish if the portion is too big (2 of us have small appetite). The waitress face change immediately and we can feel that she is not happy with us. Then, we requested for one additional rice (it‚Äôs a whole chicken for a portion), she just throw the rice bowl on the table, like we owe her money. Food is above average but our mood is ruin. Not an enjoyable meal, not sure it‚Äôs the culture different, she should have just tell us that each person have to order at least one. :("
50,"Some reviewers amused me. Not everyone understands that this is a restaurant for every specific Korean dish: chicken soup with ginseng. Samgyetang is a dish consisting of chicken ginseng soup which is simply a whole young chicken in a broth of Korean ginseng. The chicken is then stuffed with glutinous rice, garlic, nuts, Korean dates, and more ginseng. The combination of fall off the bone chicken, broth, rice, and stuffing make samgyetang a unique and flavorful Korean dish that seems to get better with every bite. Of course, accompanied by some varieties of kimchi and Korean pancakes. You can try and buy ginseng tincture. Stylistically, the restaurant is designed in Korean style: halls with chairs and Korean halls. First of all, it is necessary to note the highest quality of food, warming the encouraging taste of soup. I was in December. In the icy windy city, this was a wonderful event. Great service, great room. Of course, those who want an ultra-modern room recommend to go to McDonald‚Äôs."
50,My Seoul visit purpose is to eat Tosokchon Samgetang. everytime have to line. but No matter for it. If when you eat Samgetang You will forgot for long line.
50,Loved the date and chestnut flavours together with the ginseng. The stuffed glutinous rice inside the chicken absorbed all the lovely tastes. I also loved the kimchi pots and ginseng wine that came with the meal.  We luckily came early 11am on a Sunday cos by the time we left there were easily 50+ people queuing outside.
20,"Tosokchon has been our family's favorite restaurant for as long as I can remember, even way before it became so popular as the late President No's favorite. However, it has lost the quality & taste of Samgyetang (Whole Chicken Rice Soup) recently. My family of three gerenerations visited the restaurant each at different occasions, and our opinioin was all in accord. The dish tasted like a frozen chicken just warmed up in the kitchen; the meat was too soft, almost tasteless, yet not fully cooked so that the inside was still pink. The sweat rice inside whole chicken was cooked but not to the full extent of Samgyetang. I don't know whether it is the long line of tourists waiting in front or just the ingredients, but it did not taste the same. My family miss the good old taste, but would not go back there until we hear otherwise."
40,Nice soup. I recommend you add the dry ginseng (additional cost) and the ginseng liquor into the soup. The soup is so good. I guess its good for our health too. One bowl is good for one person. As usual it comes with side dish. The service is just average. Will come back for the soup !
50,"We had the samyetang (‚Ç©17000) and seafood pancake (‚Ç©15000) both of which were delicious. To be fair, however, I didn't think it was miles ahead of other less popular samyetang places. It is definitely worth a try, but I wouldn't queue hours just to try it"
50,"This place has become a little overrated as most tourist will visit here for the ginseng chicken soup. The price is a little steep but I feel it‚Äôs still worth the try! Serving is quick, service is swift and this place can get really crowded during peak hours!  Nonetheless, this place is still one of my places to go when I‚Äôm in Korea!"
40,Very popular. Came at 1.30pm had 20m queue but seated in 15 mins.  The ginseng chicken soup was up to expectations. The chicken is stuffed with glutinous rice. If want to drink clear soup don't mash up the rice otherwise it becomes a thick porridge. Also note as chicken almost disintegrates being so tender there will be penty of small chicken bones in the mix.
40,"I was there before. Samgyetang and other meals are delicious. Last time I went during lunch time and there were so many people waiting outside. This time I came after 2 pm and there were not so many people like before. I would recommend to come after lunch time. Staff is efficient and serve quickly, but not as friendly as in some other places in Seoul."
50,I went there with my friends. And this was my first time trying korean chicken soup. The restaurant is cozy and nice with traditional design. The service was fast. The soup was amazing and their kimchi was so good.
40,Soup is flavourful & loaded with nutrients. It's unique dining experience as restaurant is located in a hanok.
