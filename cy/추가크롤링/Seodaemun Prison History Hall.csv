It shows a part of the painful history of the Japanese colonial period. If I had lived at that time, would I have been able to overcome such torture, or would I be able to try the independence movement itself? I thought. I went to the history museum and saw some torture methods. I just wondered if it was really possible to do something for people. It is really true that our independence was achieved after overcoming such harsh torture... History believes that both the positive and the negative are history. Whatever it is, I think it is best for the public to make the decision based on the facts. It was a heartbreaking scene down to the smallest details. We hope that many people will come and enjoy it. Now let's talk about using the facilities. As I don't know, there is no official parking lot. There is a parking lot right next to it, and I thought for a long time whether it was right to park here. There is, of course, a parking fee. and also. There is a vending machine when entering, but it has been discontinued. It may be because of Corona. Then there should be a notice saying that it cannot be used. Upon entering, the booth asks if you have made a reservation. There are two of you inside. When we talk and try to issue a ticket, it tells us to go sideways. Tickets are issued at the ticketing booth right next door. Pick up your ticket and check it at the booth right next to you. There are a total of four people issuing tickets. It is a system that can be done alone if it is a general company. If you understand that confirmation is necessary due to Corona, two people in two booths is enough. And you don't even need the ticket itself. Where is this nonsense system where you pay and enter a ticket and check it right next to you? If you go, you will know.

349,Masa Mrhige,5,"(Translated by Google) It is a good idea to take the opportunity of this tour to study the history of Japan and South Korea. I myself had the opportunity to find out if Korea's history education for Japan is true. The one I put out as a reference photo was taken by me from what was on display around 2006. It shows the state of torture by the police. I think it's because it turns out that the fact that it's changed to something else now isn't true or is too exaggerated. It seems that Ryu Gwansun will also be awarded the Order of Merit for National Foundation, ""Republic of Korea"" as an independent martyr, but there are various theories about her, and it is said that it is based on the facts from each one. It can be said that it is in a difficult state.  I hope that the hindrance to friendship between Japan and South Korea will create an atmosphere that will be examined again.  (Original) ここでの見学を契機に、日韓の歴史を勉強することになるとよいでしょう。私自身は韓国の対日歴史教育が事実なのかどうかを調べる契機になりました。 私が参考写真として出したものは、2006年頃に展示してあったものを私が撮ったものです。警察による拷問の様子を表しています。現在、別な物に変わっているということは、事実ではない、あるいは誇張しすぎということがわかったからだと考えます。柳寛順についても、独立烈士として建国勲章一等級「大韓民国章」を新たに授与することになったらしいですが、彼女については諸説あり、その一つ一つから見ても事実に基づいているとは言い難い状態であると言えます。  日韓友好の妨げになることは、もう一度検証してみるぐらいの雰囲気が生まれることを期待します。",5 months ago

It was one of the places I had to visit in a hurry because it was temporarily closed while I was trying to visit Changgyeonggung. I've always seen it mostly in documentaries or drama movies, but it's actually my first visit. Unfortunately, the deadline was over, so I couldn't go inside, but only on the outside. I looked inside and observed the outside for a long time. I came here by bus from Changdeokgung Palace and this is connected to Independence Gate. Actually, the whole park is one in a big way, but when you look at it separately, they are each like this. I missed the daytime visit by coming here after seeing the Independence Gate first, but I was still able to see the outskirts at night. The fence is not very high, so anyone can observe at night. If you go down a bit, you will find Independence Gate and Independence Hall, so I recommend viewing them in conjunction. Actually, the purpose of coming here was to shoot Independence Gate. There is a convenience store right in front of the main gate and there is a toilet next to the independence gate, so there is no inconvenience.

We hope that many of you will visit and remember the righteous people left behind in our painful history.

Thanks to the patriots who went through all kinds of hardships, it is a place where you can feel grateful to be able to live in the present Korea.  It is a place where children and adults alike are reminded not to forget the painful history. One thing to note is that the internal exhibition halls lack air conditioning. Elementary school students had a hard time visiting on a very hot day.  It is a place where the saying ""there is no future for a nation that has forgotten its history"" touches the heart deeply.
