44,Young Jun Kim,5,"(Translated by Google) There is also a pretty good botanical garden in Korea. At first, I wanted to pay 5,000 won for this plant, but because it is a spectacular gathering of plants from all over the world, the admission fee of 5,000 won is not at all wasted, and it was a perfect place to go out on a date or outing on a spring day like this. All the photos taken in the greenhouse come out so beautifully colored, so if you diligently take photos while looking around, you might be able to get some life photos. As of today's 4.2, the flower buds are slowly coming up, so it seems that the Botanic Garden will be transformed into a very pretty one next week, around mid-April. It is recommended to go early in the morning as the parking lot starts to get crowded from lunch time. On a nice day, I wanted to eat cup noodles outdoors, but there is an E-Mart 24 convenience store on the 4th floor and it is attached to a restaurant, so please note that they do not sell anything that can be cooked. There is also a Smoothie King. Moving is quick and comfortable.

There are not many signs, but to go to the greenhouse, you have to go to the theme park. On weekends, it seems to get crowded from around 2pm, so it is recommended to visit early. If you buy a ticket and enter, you can enter the greenhouse and go out and visit the outdoors. It's hot in the greenhouse, so it's better to leave the padding alone, and I don't think it will last long if you have children. Each country has a variety of unknown tropical plants and flowers and trees. It's a decent size, so there's a lot to see. There are a few sculptures outdoors, but in winter, before the buds sprout, there are only bare branches, so there is not much to see and a walk is appropriate. There are 2-3 large cafes inside and near. Meals must be served at Magoknaru.

512,HS HA,5,"(Translated by Google) At the time of development, it was widely located in Magok, so it is possible to take a pleasant walk when viewing the outdoors, and the lawn spreads out widely so that families can have picnics and light ball games.  The theme garden, which is a paid outdoor botanical garden, also has a sufficient area, beautiful landscaping and various themes, so it is not difficult to move necessary to see it. There are no shortages of benches and places to sit in between. It harmonizes with the lines of the uniformly located building group in Magok.  The greenhouse is built in the shape of a huge, transparent flower when viewed from the outside. A little after passing the entrance to the greenhouse, a spectacular view unfolds. Artificial rocks, waterfalls, and well-kept flowers and trees mix with the humid smell of the temperate zone, giving a feeling of happiness. It is a building with a high ceiling, and the second-floor walking path provides a three-dimensional movement line that crosses overhead above the lush trees of the first-floor viewing path.  There is a souvenir shop on the second floor of the building adjacent to the greenhouse, a convenience store and food court on the fourth floor, and an observation deck on the roof of the building. This observation deck is also a small botanical garden.  Considering the overwhelming area of the outdoor botanical garden and the amount of plants of valuable varieties in the modern, structured greenhouse, it is currently judged to be the best botanical garden in Korea.

Most of the plants are in mediocre shape and there aren’t any particularly beautiful or special plants or flowers.  The inside conservatory is split into two parts: Tropical & Mediterranean. In the Mediterranean section are a ton of cacti from the USA and plants from New Zealand and Australia as well as some plants from other far flung places, by very definition NOT in the Mediterranean.  Poorly maintained and poorly organized. Compare this to other botanical gardens in neighboring countries and it is a joke. If you want an afternoon out wandering around average plants then it’s not bad, but if you’re expecting to see some beautiful or special plants you’re better off exploring google or finding another garden somewhere else in Korea.",11 months ago
