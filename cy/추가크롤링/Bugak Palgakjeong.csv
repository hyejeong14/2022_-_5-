If you use Bukak Skyway as your destination in the navigation system, you will just pass on the road, so if you want to see the beautiful scenery from Bukak Skyway, you can come with Bugak Palgakjeong as your destination. Ramen is open 24 hours and coffee is open until 1:30 in the morning. Not because the facilities are pretty, but because of the scenery! #date course  (Original) 서울에 오래 살면서 이런 곳이 있는것만 알고, 실제 드라이브는 처음 입니다. 네비게이션에서  북악스카이웨이를 도착지로 하면 그냥 도로위를 지나가게 되기 때문에 북악스카이웨이에서 바라보는 아름다운 경치를 보려면 북악팔각정을 도착지로 하고 오시면 됩니다. 라면은 24시간, 커피는 새벽 한시반 까지 운영되네요. 시설이 예뻐서가 아니라 경관이 좋아서 별다섯!! #데이트코스",10 months ago
