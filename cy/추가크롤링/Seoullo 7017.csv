10,모야모,4,"(Translated by Google) The Seoul Station overpass, built in 1970, was named 7017 because it was made into an overpass park where people could walk in 2017. From Hoehyeon Station Exit 5 to Malli-dong, we planted grass, flowers and trees in our own way, and installed information centers, cafes, bakeries, coffee shops, souvenir shops, building connections, and elevators. Each tree goes through the adoption process and seems to be adopted by an individual. It seems to be a resting place and reference place for those who like flowers and trees or study, but the condition of the trees was not satisfactory due to the unusually hot and dry weather.

Located directly at Seoul Central Station, the former elevated road now runs as a green strip across the streets of Seoul near Namdaemun. Some repair work is currently being carried out in the Seoul Station area, so some areas are covered with black plastic sheeting. This clouds the beauty of Seoullo7017 a bit, but it is still nice to dive into this green oasis in the middle of Seoul.  (Original) Das Seoullo7017 war in der Vergangenheit eine Hochstraße für Autos, um nördliche und östliche Teile der Stadt zu verbinden.

Momentan werden in dem Bereich des Seoul Bahnhofs einige Reparaturarbeiten durchgeführt, weswegen einige Bereiche mit schwarzer Plastikfolie abgedeckt sind.

I can go to Namdaemun Market and Lotte Mart. I do not have to face the car on the narrow road without worrying about the time, and the overpass of the car is also different. Walking while watching the blooming flowers and trees in every season, it is perfect for watching the scenery overlooking Hanjin at a glance.

164,Se Kweon Roh,4,"(Translated by Google) The Seoul Station overpass, which was built as a 'vehicle road' in 1970, is the place where it was made into a 'people road' in 2017. Whatever the historical background, this road is a good example of Seoul's transportation system.  It shows Sungnyemun Gate, which was used to enter and exit Seoul during the Joseon Dynasty, Seoul Station, which plays an important transportation function from modern Korea to the present, and the Seoul Station Overpass itself, which connects the two spaces cut off by Seoul Station.  In addition, it is currently being used as a space for rest and culture. Above the 7017 are several plants and event venues.  The only disappointing thing is that the vessel containing nature was not built in a more nature-friendly way. Also, although the motif was the High Line Park in New York, USA, it shows a big difference from the image.  Nevertheless, it is undoubtedly a space that is receiving a lot of love.  (Original) 1970년 '차량길'로 만들어진 서울역 고가도로가 2017년 '사람길'로 만들어진 곳입니다. 역사적 배경이 어떠하든 현재 이 길은 서울의 교통의 한 축을 잘 보여주는 곳입니다.  과거 조선시대에 서울의 출입을 담당한 숭례문, 근대기 한국에서부터 현재에 이르기까지 중요한 교통기능을 담당하는 서울역, 그리고 서울역으로 인해 단절된 양 공간을 이어주는 서울역 고가도로 자체를 모두 보여주고있습니다.  더하여, 현재에는 쉼과 문화의 공간으로 활용되기까지 하고있습니다. 7017의 위에는 여러 식물과 이벤트 장소가 있습니다.  다만 아쉬운 점은 자연을 담는 그릇이 좀 더 자연친화적으로 지어지지 못한 점입니다. 또한 미국 뉴욕의 하이라인파크를 모티브로 했지만, 이미지에서부터 큰 차이를 보이는 점입니다.  그럼에도 불구하고 큰 사랑을 받고있는 공간임은 틀림없어 보입니다.",a year ago

Currently, Seoullo 7017 also plays a role in connecting nearby tourist attractions such as the Sungnyemun Gate. , Myeong-dong, and Namdaemun Market.  This park on top of Seoullo 7017 is designed to be beautiful and comfortable for pedestrians. There are about 228 species of flowers and 24,000 plants planted along Seoullo 7017. You can visit this Seoul tourist icon for free. There are lots of interesting and instagramable photo spots here, it's a shame to miss them.  Seoullo 7017 covers a fairly short distance, and usually only takes 30 minutes to explore. However, within this concentrated area there are several landmark Seoul attractions, including Namdaemun Market, Seoul Station Square, Namsan Seoul Tower, Sungnyemun Gate, and Seoul Square. These attractions have a whole new look from the lookout points located all over Seoullo 7017, even though they are only one floor higher than ground level.  The best place to take souvenir photos at Seoullo 7017 is Seoul Station Square, set against the hustle and bustle of the bustling Seoul Station. Other popular photo spots include the observatory of Rose Square and the nearby Ivy Theater.  The streets of Seoullo 7017 are decorated with all kinds of plants, arranged in Korean alphabetical order. There are more than 50 types of flowers and 228 species of trees, resembling an outdoor arboretum. The bright roses planted in Rose Square in particular make for a romantic atmosphere.  Several uniquely named trees have been planted along the road to Namdaemun Market. By reading the small black boards, you can find trees named 2 PM's Junho, EXO's Suho, Sana Twice and other K-pop stars. All of these trees have the support of their respective idol fan clubs.

Taman di atas Seoullo 7017 ini di desain begitu cantik dan nyaman bagi pejalan kaki. Terdapat sekitar 228 spesies bunga dan 24.000 tanaman yang ditanam di sepanjang Seoullo 7017 ini. Kamu bisa mengunjungi ikon wisata Seoul ini secara gratis. Banyak spot foto menarik dan instagramable lho disini, sayang banget buat dilewatin.  Seoullo 7017 mencakup jarak yang lumayan pendek, dan biasanya hanya memerlukan 30 menit untuk menjelajahi tempat ini. Meskipun begitu, di dalam area terkonsentrasi ini terdapat beberapa objek wisata landmark Seoul, termasuk Pasar Namdaemun, Alun-alun Stasiun Seoul, Menara Seoul Namsan, Gerbang Sungnyemun, dan Alun-alun Seoul. Objek-objek wisata ini memiliki tampilan yang sama sekali baru jika dilihat dari titik pengamatan yang berada di seluruh Seoullo 7017, meskipun hanya satu lantai lebih tinggi dari permukaan tanah.  Tempat terbaik untuk mengambil foto kenang-kenangan di Seoullo 7017 adalah Alun-Alun Stasiun Seoul, dengan latar belakang hiruk pikuk Stasiun Seoul yang ramai. Tempat-tempat foto populer lainnya termasuk observatorium Alun-Alun Rose dan Teater Ivy di dekatnya.  Sepanjang jalan Seoullo 7017 dihiasi segala jenis tanaman, diatur dalam urutan abjad Korea. Ada lebih dari 50 jenis bunga dan 228 spesies pohon, menyerupai arboretum luar ruangan. Mawar-mawar cerah yang ditanam di Alun-alun Rose khususnya membuat suasana romantis.  Beberapa pohon unik bernama telah ditanam sepanjang jalan ke arah Pasar Namdaemun.
