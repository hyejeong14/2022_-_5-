0,0,341,The backdrop with leaves etc was dramatic But there really isnt anything to see inside the structures and we could only appreciate from the outside Wish there was more The changing of the guards was a nice bonus,0,anything
1,1,354,This is a place with a very interesting history but they have not made anything of it It is some nice buildings and very little information Thats it,1,anything
2,2,391,As I have done most of the palaces this one didnt have anything special no must see factor until I went round the Historical Museum This was the tick in the box for this Palace The w1000 also includes the museum and if you want to walk round head over as soon as you arrive and get yourself on a tour It is access by tour only and they leave every 30 minutes but gets full quick as the groups are only small Shoes off and slippers on they gave me an English audio so I could follow round but obviously the passionate guide was giving the locals much more than I was hearing All renovated in the last 10 years but decorated as best as they could from old photos and with some of the original furniture The history you get is the best thing and even some photos of the old emperors and emperoresses Your 1000 doesnt also get you into the art gallery that will cost you more,2,anything
3,3,560,This late 16th century palace and its numerous reconstructions really fail to impress The park itself is lovely at best with a nice pond and fountain in its middle but the palace is anything but unique The National Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art lies within the park but it was being renovated while we visited in August so we could not visit it of course nobody bothers to tell you that when you buy the ticket to the park  apx 1US Skip it,3,anything
4,4,620,I enjoyed this Palace lots of history I arrived by subwayline 1 to City Hall the station stop was right at the entrance to the Palace Entrance fee was only KRW3000 which was well worth it there is so much to explore Be sure to check out the Changing of the Guard Ceremony which they do several times a day not to be missed there is also a very interesting Museum and a gift shop which offers some very colorful gifts After visiting Deoksugung check out Namdaemun Market which is a short walk away you will find anything here also a great place to grab a bite to eat,4,anything
5,0,3, Near Deoksugung for over 10 years I went to work but this was my first time going in It was spacious and quieter than I thought I thought there would be a space like this in the city center When I get a little ,5,going
6,1,8, I recommend going in the morning I went around 11 oclock and it was so hot that I couldnt move You can watch the changing ceremony at the main gate at 11 oclock ,6,going
7,2,22, An old palace walk in the city center But the palace special less shade If you are going in summer be sure to bring a parasol Take it with ,7,going
8,3,25, I had time before going to Incheon International Airport so I chose Deoksugung which is the closest to Seoul Station It was good except that it was a pity that the City Art Museum was closed ,8,going
9,4,158, I remember going to a drawing contest when I was in public school ,9,going
10,5,226, A good place to take a walk before going to Seoul Station ,10,going
11,6,251,There is a common believe that most South Korean Temples look pretty much alike and that is an undeniable truth Nonetheless there is a hidden differential beauty on each one of them Here at this temple we could appreciate the differences  This palace also has a lot of dynamic history as has been occupied not only by the Korean Royal family In 1897 after the incident when Emperor Gojong took refuge in the Russian legation he returned to this place and named it Gyeongungung again During the Japanese occupation of Korea in 1592 the residential buildings became a temporary royal residence after all the other palaces were destroyed by fires  Many of the structures here have since been removed or sold In 1933 all buildings except for a few central and western style buildings were removed It was then made a park and opened to the public  At the end of the trail you may walk youll find a turquoise Blue Fountain European looking On the left of this you will find a smaller part of the palace detached unit and on the right of the fountain youll be right in front of the Deoksugung National Museum of Modern  Contemporary Art  Its important at the door to purchase the full package ticket so that you can appreciate both Palace and Museum  Since 2007 restoration work to restore Deoksugung Palace to its original specifications  This work has been ongoing We do recommend extensively this palace although we couldnt appreciate the full beauty as it has been a bitter winter this January but in Spring must be definitely wonderful  Dont miss it,11,going
12,7,255,Ive been here a few times over the years and it never disappoints  I love the fact that it has a changing of the guard ceremony 3 times a day I think and other stuff going on too  Once inside though it feels like a different world with a park like ambience plus a mixture of Korean and Western architecture which makes it unique for a Korean palace I like to just sit and watch the world go by here  I walked here but its close to City Hall metro station if youre using the underground,12,going
13,8,259,Deoksugung is the only palace open at night and the way it is all lit up is both beautiful and atmospheric There was a childrens concert going on when we visited which we stopped to listen to,13,going
14,9,275,We didnt go inside the palace but watched the lavish and dramatic changing of the guards at 330 I think the other times are 12 and 2pm but check that if going We get lucky enough to try on free Hanbok costumes to experience the change of the guards and pose with the guards after their ceremony The whole thing lasted about 20 minutes and there were explanations in English The outfits were colourful Theres a huge drum thats beaten too,14,going
15,10,311,We visited as we had a little time and were in the area It is cheap to visit but there isnt much to see compared to the other palaces The changing of the guard ceremony is fun to watch and there is an explanation of what is happening in English There is some information about the buildings in English but not very much I would say it isnt worth going if you only have a few days in the city but stop by if you will be around for a week or more,15,going
16,11,384,Its not expensive for the ticket and you can walk around enjoy the old Korean style palace It took me just 20 minutes to see them all as well as going to the toilet on the other side of the palace,16,going
17,12,415,Deoksugung palace is smaller than other palaces But it attracted me more cause I could enjoy it with less people there I was there when theres a ceremonial not the guards changinghappened It took place in front of the palace gate and they even had a parade on the street No need to buy ticket at that time I was so lucky I could enter the palace for free By the time I finished going around the parade just returned back so I could take more photos The location is close to city hall,17,going
18,13,436,As with all the Seoul palaces this place is majestic and peaceful The only issue with this one compared to the others is that most of the information signs were only in Korean and this turned us off going to other museums,18,going
19,14,440,I didnt expect much from this palace its small a third of its original size and gives an impression of a lessthankorean palace sibce there are modern buildings in it BUT It has difinitely exceeded my expectation Firstly it was considerably less crowded than Gyeongbukgung even in its peak time which is 11 am when the Changing of the Guard takes place Secondly the Changing of the guard is a wonderful experience you can follow the marching band around and watch the change comfortably and then even pause a few times to let you take photos with the guards Thirdly the history of the different buildings that compile the palace is very interesting One of the buildings is a fusion between traditional korean architecture and imperial architecture and to my opinion it was spectacular  For the meek price of 1000 won I recommend going I arrived around 920am so I even managed to get a free english tour with a guide before following the marching band  Overall I spent 3 hours exploring including the guard change and half a guided tour,19,going
20,15,447,Located in the middle of several touristic spots This palace gives you the opportunity of scape of the big city and see some beautiful buildings The entrance is very cheap Around 1 US dollar Theres the change of guard constantly going on And its a great opportunity to have a bit of the spirit of old Korea and take pictures with those characters Theres free wifi inside and its not allowed to smoke,20,going
21,16,464,Unfortunately we missed the changing of the guard but its a beautiful palace for sure Definitely worth going to even in the dead of winter I recommend it,21,going
22,17,518,My aunt and I came upon this little place by accident we were actually trying to catch the metro for another palace The interesting thing about this palace is that its remains lie across the street from Seoul City Hall where there is always a concert or market or something going on When you walk in the palace itself is just beyond the trees and paths of greenery The designs of the palace itself are those that one sees in all the palaces flowers with bright colors and repetition of all the designs As you walk further into the area you come across a museum of art which is separated from the palace by a little pond with a fountain The hustle and bustle of the street and city beyond the palace walls all but disappears Its crazy to have the two contrasts of old meets new in this small area,22,going
23,18,548,Entrance fee is cheap so worth going in for a look although this palace is pretty small  We were lucky to witness the changing of the guards when we arrive  Take pictures with the 3 guards standing at the entrance They looked nice in their tradtional costume,23,going
24,19,552,I went here around 930 AM and it was nearempty People say that you should wait till later to avoid to tour groups but there was probably 5 other people here when I visited This palace grounds is amazingly preserved and it shows the traditional architecture of the Joseon Dynasty I highly recommend buying the combination ticket for the other palaces if you are going to visit them as well It costs 10000 Won 10 USD,24,going
25,20,594,I went here at night so I missed all the guided tour Comparing this palace to the other it is relative small If you are only going to one palace I recommended you to go to the others first,25,going
26,21,603,Nice palace with a variety of architecture to include Korean mixed Korean architecture designed by Russian architecture western style buildings They had some interactive games and the kids enjoyed playing the one that they played We watched the changing of the guard which is scheduled at various times and occurs at the front gate This palace had a nice thrown room that you could go in which was unique If you only have a chance to visit one palace then I would go to one of the others as there are multiple palaces in Seoul such as Gyeongbokgung but if you have time or are going to be in Seoul for awhile then this is a nice visit It only took a few hours Fee is reasonable as we have found most of them to be in Seoul,26,going
27,22,612,Deoksugung is easy to get to from Line 1 Metro stop city hall it sits along side the modern western style building I arrived just as the changing of the guards ceremony was starting the ceremony happens every day except Monday at 11am2pm and 330pm After watching the ceremony you can line up and have your photo taken with them the security guards are more then happy to taken your photos The grounds are very peaceful and many people go there and just sit and enjoy the scenery As it is the smallest of all the palaces it is rather plain however due to buying the combo ticket it was worth going in and checking it,27,going
28,23,616,Of all the changings of the guard the one at Deoksugung Palace is the only one that felt personal At this location the changing of the guard is close enough to reach out and touch the guards you can feel the drumbeat and you can take photos with them after the ceremony As a photographer this allows for some wonderful closeup photos If you are going to choose one Changing of the Guard ceremony Deoksugung Palace is the one  The Palace itself is interesting but fell third behind Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace for us One of the Five Grand Palaces of the Joseon Dynasty Deoksugung Palace however is unique in that it offers the only example of a palace built in western style Seokjojeon and the first western style built in Korea The juxtaposition of ancient old and the very modern surroundings is fascinating and disconcerting all at once  Well worth the nominal admission price the best part of our visit to Deoksugung Palace was the ChangingoftheGuard Ceremony outside the main gates a free attraction and one of my favorite in Seoul,28,going
29,24,622,One of Koreas grand palaces and located near the City Hall The changing of the guards is one of the attraction at 11h  14h The big drum sound brings in the courtyard the guards in colorful period costumes performing the daily ceremony accompanied by martial drums You have the opportunity to listen to the explanation in English It helps to understand The entry fee for this palace is 3000 won and you need time if you want to understand what was going on in that century and please yourself with photos opportunities The palaces the large pound the water clock shaped like a bell ancient artillery pieces the museum and the surrounding is large you will need time It can also be hot an umbrella could be useful We enjoyed it We love history,29,going
30,25,624,One of Koreas grand palaces its located near City Hall which probably explains the police presence The changing of the guards happen at around 11AM and 2PM Make sure you catch it since its a treat with men in period costumes performing the ceremony accompanied by martial drums and voice over annotations in Korean and English so youll understand whats going on You dont have to pay the 1000 Won entrance to witness it since it is happening outside the gates But dont scrimp on the entrance fee as inside is a peaceful and expansive compound housing temples retainer housing royal buildings including two Western style buildings that wont be out of place in Europe or Washington DC  There are even replicas of an ancient artillery piece that fires multiple arrows and a water clock shaped like a bell Lots of photo opportunities in this area and its not too crowded,30,going
31,26,627,As we were going to City Hall we passed Deoksugung Palace and decided to enter it since we were already there I think we only got charged 1000 won although others say the charge was 10000 won I remember thinking how cheap the entrance fee for this palace was and that was the reason we decided to check it out  If youre going around Seoul in a taxi you will notice that there are many palaces nearby In my country theres only one palace There was a gate called Daehanmun gate and supposedly a changing of the guard but we didnt see one  We went to the throne room of the palace where dignitaries were received You see the seat where the king would sit down If you saw one of those period Korean drama of the Joseon dynasty this is how it looks like It wasnt really huge  We also saw Seokjojeon from afar and it has fountains Unfortunately for us it rained very hard while we were at the throne room and so we didnt really get to visit the rest of the palace  The courtyard very quickly flooded and I dont know how people knelt here during the Joseon dynasty period to give respect to the king The pavement wasnt even smooth and it would hurt anyones knees who knelt there for a period of time  As soon as the rain subsided we decided to leave the palace grounds so we can proceed to where we were really going,31,going
32,27,647,There are many palaces in Seoul and unless you are spending a long period of time there impossible to visit all so I chose 2 that I thought would have colorful changing of guards ceremonies and I was not disappointed with Deoksugung The Palace is located on the main street of Sejong and more importantly right across the street from Seoul City Hall and Seoul Park You can take the number 1 train green line or the number 2 train dark blue line and get off at the city hall stop Take exit 2 or 3 from the station and once thru the turnstiles look for and elevator It will let you off at street level directly in front of the Palace Check for the times of the changing of the guards but they are listed at 1100 200 and 330 It seems it may be more frequent as I was in that area a number of times for other attractions and it always seemed to be going on Position your self more to the left of the entrance as the procession enters from the stoned and brick side street to the left of the Palace especially if you want to take pics I videoed the ceremony with my Ipad and the pics were great This is a must for any visit to Seoul something that friends and family back home will appreciate Not something you see everyday The grounds of the Palace are spacious and clean but looks barren The day we visited the Museum and another building were closed for renovations and there were very few people on the grounds There are many trees offering shade if a warm day and a teacoffee house toward the back with tables and chairs outside It was just peaceful to sit and look around at all the history and culture of Korean royalty There are a number of buildings to view although the landscaped grounds were not as beautiful as Gyeongbokgung,32,going
33,28,652,one of the palace that always seen in the korean drama a traditional palace that surrounded by the modern and high tech buildings in the downtownspecial about this palace is that a 2storey gong which you cant find in traditional palace building it is relatively small compare to the Gyeongbukgong and you can walk around in a relax modechanging of guard ceremony is available but be sure you check the show time before going,33,going
34,29,662,if you come to Seoul you will find out there are several palaces in old town However these all palaces were in one place under diferrent buildings name these name became the each name of palaces now The royal family in Joseon dinasty lived in this big palace but undergoing the fight against outsidersJapanese Russian Americans English French etc who wanted to explore new territory these palaces were witness for the history it is only Deoksu Palace who has mordern buildings inside of Korean traditional palaces which were done in early 1900s by Japanese FYI the original palces were built about early 14 C You can also find Russian styles tea salon where the last second emperor used to receive another countries diplomats You can also find a hosue which has stairs for the 2nd floor That is really rare in Korean history Most of Korean traditional houses do no have 2nd floor nor stairs Anyways that building is not painted either which is also unique When the building was builit the economy of Joseon dinasty was bad so the King decided to be humble not to waste commom peoples money he decided not to paint the building It became symbolic for the following kings so that building remains unpainted upto now to memorise that kings will you can also find more info from the official web httpwwwdeoksugunggokr,34,going
35,0,193, There was nothing special about Deoksugung Palace in winter but I went to Park Soogeun I see it all and go round and round but there is a mood just as written ,35,nothing

39,4,557,Most hotels concierge will tell you theres nothing much to see here But this palace is quiet has a mix of architecture styles and is quite interesting Do not miss the changing of guards ceremony and check with hotel the timings especially during winter if too cold apparently there is no ceremony In the Seokjojeon hall theres an interesting guided tour foreigners follow the Korean group with audio guide about King Gojong and his son Sunjong the last monarch of Korea Sadly the Korean tour moves very quickly from room to room and those listening to audio guides are ushered out to another room before its finished The audio guide is very informative,39,nothing
40,5,593,This is the only attraction that had an admission feebut there was little seemost of the buildings had been demolishedand those that remained had nothing in themthere was an art gallery which I was in and out of in 5 minutespoor reward for a long walk on a hot day,40,nothing
