0,0,152,I went to Changdeokgung Palace on a Sunday afternoon. It has less much people than Gyeongbokgung Palace. But I was not disappointed. I had opportunity to take many beautiful photos with interruption from other tourists. Don't expect grand buildings here as well as other palaces in Seoul. It offers a different kind of beauty and experience comparing to palaces in Beijing.,0,disappointed
1,1,183,"We visited this place with two children. It is beautiful place and lots to see Highly recommend. Give enough time . Lots of walking . We took English speaking guide, Bit disappointed as she spoke very fast and did not allow group together to catch up. Go early as not to miss changing of guard and visit to Gardens.   .",1,disappointed
2,2,251,I think my expectation was way too high and the day I visited was a cold day without much sun. That's why I was little disappointed and it would have been so much better if the day was warmer and brighter.,2,disappointed
3,3,257,"It’s unclear what, if anything, is the original structure. It has been reconstructed with bits from another palace which makes it all seem a bit pointless, especially since they point out that many structures were modified in the process. Is this really what the palace looked like? And what parts are original, from the other palace, or new from the restoration which began in the 1990’s?  You can’t go into any of the ”historical” buildings (from the 1990’s..?) which means you only see exteriors and the occasional glance through and open window or door.  There is very little written information in English (or any other language for that matter). To enter the garden you have to join the English speaking guided tour which only runs 3-4 times a day, and since it’s a limited number of people per tour, chances are likely that you won’t get tickets unless you booked in advance. Although I can’t say I’m terribly disappointed in not getting a spot for the garden since I wasn’t very impressed with the palace to begin with.  I wouldn’t recommend this one.",3,disappointed
4,4,511,"The palace is nice, less crowded than Gyeongbokgung and a bit smaller, so I liked this one more. But the main reason I came here was the Secret Garden tour and we were not disappointed. The tour itself provides valuable information for those interested in the history of the place. I stayed back for the first few buildings, then decided to explore on my own, since I wanted to get nice pictures without the whole group in them (the tour is limited to 100 people). I would recommend that. You can always go back and catch up with the group, or ask the guide some questions. The gardens are so beautiful, we were lucky with the weather; sunshine and blue sky. It was just amazing and I took a million pictures (see below :-)), a total MUST DO if you love gardens. I would go back and book the tour again, it's so beautiful!",4,disappointed
5,5,715,"First of all, palaces in Seoul aren't something spectacular nor in fantastic sceneries. That's not what they pursued in the past. Gates might be the biggest structures. And maybe some temples on mountains or on cliffs will be better for wallpapers. Tourists expecting those might be disappointed after visits. Nevertheless, there are people who have been so impressed on them and Changdeokgung is one of the best.  - location: Locating in a less crowded area and with less reputation than Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung is comparatively quieter and more comfortable to take a look. Gwangjang Market, Jongmyo Shrine and Changgyeonggung Palace are near and good for connected package in a single day.  - The true beauty of Korea's palaces is a harmony with surrounding nature. Trees, rocks and even views around are parts of the palace. Sophisticated roofs of buildings are also nice.  - The tour is walking outside and watching. The good weather is very important.  - There aren't many buildings and visitors can't enter inside.  - Guided tours only during weekdays. Free visit on Saturday. I think slow travelers will prefer visiting on Saturday.  - Secret Garden: Called as Huwon(後苑 Backyard Garden) or Biwon(秘院 Secret Garden) in the history. 5,000 won to have a guided tour. This takes about 90 min and there are several buildings and pavilions in the forest. The old tree near the way out shouldn't be missed. Right next to the entrance of Huwon, there's the entrance of the other palace, Changgyeonggung.  - The gift shop has tons of quality gifts comparing to most other folk shops in Seoul. Prices are high as they need to be.  - Events like night specials will be also nice. They have illuminations and great performances.",5,disappointed
6,6,738,"If you have been in Asia a bit like China, Vietnam...you may feel disappointed. The whole complex is rebuilt so not much impression . The good point is the great museum inside",6,disappointed
7,7,743,"I read about a Moonlight guided tour of this palace from 8 PM - 10 PM on Sunday nights from June 2017 - November 2017, so I jumped on the opportunity and booked the ticket 3 months in advance of my trip. I was not disappointed - this palace is seriously SO beautiful. Between Gyeonbokgung (the large main palace in Seoul at the city center) and this palace, I MUCH preferred Changdeokgung. The guided tour at night was great, and had an English speaking guide (they offer Korean, English, and Chinese). We went through the palace and learned about the different buildings and architecture. The secret garden is only open to moonlight tour guests and we got to see that too - it was absolutely stunning with the library lit up in the background over the pond. There were traditional musicians throughout the palace as well, playing the traditional flute, and someone was playing a gayageum in the garden. After the actual tour, there was also a cultural performance, where we saw two traditional Korean dances, heard a traditional music performance by a Korean ensemble, and heard one of the traditional Korean stories that are sung by the storyteller. We got to try special tea and foods as well, and got a little gift of 6 gold bookmarks with Changdeokgung's special window architecture on them. Overall, for 32,000 Won (~$30) I would highly recommend that people get tickets to this event, or if not at least go see the palace sometime during the day. I'm not sure what the regular day admission is for the palace, but I'm sure it's less than the moonlight tour. Maybe about 10,000 Won (~$10)? But I'm not totally sure.",7,disappointed
8,8,877,"went there specifically for the renowned Secret Garden sights end of March, the cherry blossom season. You gotta pay extra for this Secret Garden guided tour, as they wont let you in by yourself. otherwise you just pay for the general admission fee. Seem wearing a Hanbok will get you some discount on the entrance fee. the old heritage building is well maintained and upon entering we were greeted by 2 blooming white cherry blossom tree. there were a few more pink cherry blossom further in. as for the Secret Garden tour, very informative tour guide and very friendly. there are different language tour session, so know when is preferred time slots. Was a disappointed though with the scenery as the flowers are not in bloom and the trees are still withered from winter. Be prepared for a little up slope hike. Really choose your visiting season well or else be disappointed. Tour guide recommend to visit during full blown spring, authumn and winter (with snow covering the land) to enjoy the place true beauty. perhaps 1 day will revisit again.",8,disappointed
9,9,1223,"There are several palaces of this type in Seoul. If you are expecting a palace in the European sense you will be disappointed. Korean palaces are interesting and quite unique, but, for me, a little goes quite a long way. I would recommend visiting one (or two maximum) palace (give yourself about an hour) and then move on to something else.",9,disappointed
10,10,1224,Went there with my wife and son especially to see secret garden. Gosh!!! What a waste of time. Nothing to see in that garden. Mughal gardens in india are much better. Took free English tour. Felt walking in a normal garden. But totally disappointed. Guide used to show a simple hut with no great architecture and give its history. I got to know that I am doomed when they told that the 1st place we will visit iin the garden is the most beautiful place. A big no from my side.,10,disappointed
11,11,1308,"The tour of the palace is truly great, but the real gem is the Secret Garden tour. Don' t miss it! You may want to check before-hand, so you're not disappointed, but the Secret Garden tour runs only occasionally. You are truly in an oasis in the middle of the beautiful city of Seoul.",11,disappointed
12,12,1366,"While not the biggest palace- this is probably the most visited of the 5 palaces in Seoul. While the biggest palace- Gyeong-bok-gung (Gung means palace), Chang-deok-gung was the most preferred palace of the king and his queens, chiefly for one reason- the SECRET GARDEN, which covers ~60% of the total palace area. While the palace itself can be entered with a ticket of KRW 3,000 and without a guide, the secret garden has a separate entrance within the palace (and ticket) and can only be accessed with a guide. Each guided tour lasts 90 minutes and tours are run in English and Korean languages (there might be other languages, but am sorry not sure about which ones, maybe Chinese & Japanese as well). The palace itself is open from 9AM to 5PM on all days (Mondays closed).  Another important piece of advice- each tour has a cap of 100 joiners and while there are 3-4 English and 4 Korean tours every day (except Mondays) and they sell our pretty fast; apparently 50 passes per tour can also be booked online, though I haven’t tried it personally. So unless you are staying for a few days and want to try your luck, try booking the pass in advance. A palace-cum-garden ticket can be obtained at the main entrance for KRW 8,000.  I actually missed the Sunday 3:30 PM (last English tour) and was almost disappointed until I came out and realised that there were 2 Korean tours available for 4 PM and 4:30 PM (ending at 5:30 and 6 PM, even though main gates shut at 5 for new entrants). As it was the last free day I had in Seoul I joined the Korean tour, which was the second best option. Really enjoyed the stunning beauty and grandeur of the secret garden, complete with small ponds with large umbrella-esque shelters for the royalty to sit by, waterfalls, and beautiful halls inside, not to mention flower beds and courtyards. And, the Korean guide realised that I had missed the English tour and was kind enough to summarise the brief to me after others had been informed and given time to click pictures.  A must-do in Seoul, apart from Gyeong-bok-gung (for the Change of Guard ceremony at 10 AM & 2 PM daily except Tuesdays when it is closed).",12,disappointed
13,13,1479,"To really appreciate Korean culture, I wanted to visit this amazing palace and immerse myself in the ornate beauty. I was not disappointed. The guards are dressed in ancient style finery and allow you to have pictures taken with them. Inside, you walk through one palace to another and can take photos of the interiors, which are dazzling. It's especially nice to do this on a day with good weather as it requires quite a lot of walking outdoors.",13,disappointed
14,14,1535,"The palace is well preserved and there are free tours to guide you round. Due to the cold temperatures, we decided to self your to cut the time. I was disappointed that you could not enter any of the buildings however there was information in English almost everywhere. Staff were helpful and polite. There are toilets a a cafe should you need them. We did not enter the second area as you could only do so on a guided tour and this lasted 90 minutes. It was too cold for us to stand around!",14,disappointed
15,15,1569,"We visited Changdeokgung Palace on two separate visits while in Seoul recently. During our first visit, we took the guided tour of the ""Secret Garden"". We had made a reservation several days in advance since the English language tour only allows for a certain number of people at a time. Our guide was exceptional. She was very knowledgeable; spoke excellent English; and you could engage her in conversation in between the various stops along the way. This was wonderful as I always want to learn more about the places I visit. I would rate the guided tour we had of the ""Secret Garden"" as the BEST thing we did during our time in Seoul. On our second day, we brought members of our family to the Changdeokgung Palace. We did not take a guided tour. There were signs along the way in English that explained each of the areas of the palace that we saw. They were very well done. Having seen the Gyeongbokgung Palace on a previous visit to Seoul, I would rate the ""Chang"" palace as being more interesting. Why? First, it's in a great setting - on a hillside with woods surrounding it. Second, it is more compact and therefore more manageable to get around to the various buildings. Third, it has the most original buildings of the two palace compounds. That's why it has been chosen as an UNESCO World Heritage site. We really enjoyed walking around Changdeokgung Palace on what was a cold November day. The gift shop was a great place to warm up when we needed to. Consider adding this palace to your list of 'must-sees' in Seoul. You will not be disappointed!",15,disappointed
16,16,1607,"Just a word of caution: The tour is physically challenging and, at times, arduous (with some steep climbs and descents, frequently on uneven ground and/or stones). Unless you are in good physical and aerobic shape, save yourself 5,000 won and give it a pass.  The guide for my group had full command of English, was cool and laid back, was thorough yet concise and, most importantly, went at a fairly leisurely pace. This allowed people to admire the sights, fall back a bit to photograph along the way and rest a bit, as the tour is physically demanding. [If anyone affiliated with the Imperial Household Agency in Kyoto reads this: You might want to take this tour to see how you should be conducting yours... seriously].  The walk is pleasant, the sights are pleasant. I was a little disappointed that the structural highlight of the tour, Juhamnu Pavilion, was “view at a distance” only. Additionally, I was a little surprised that the structures and grounds of many of the sights were not kept up as one would expect, given the garden’s significance. One of the sights (I believe it was Seonhyangjae) was under complete renovation; while that was bad for us, it will be good for those who visit when it’s completed.  The tour was vastly more valuable from a historical viewpoint than was from a visual standpoint. A Japanese garden it was not. I’m sure in the autumn it will be more visually compelling. This is a subjective opinion but I’m very torn as to whether or not it paid for itself (obviously they have to pay the tour guides which adds to their cost though, so therein lies the bind).  One thing the tour is, though, and that’s shady. If it’s uncomfortably warm or hot, you might want to schedule the tour to coincide with the height of the mid-day sun (although the strenuousness of some of the climbs sort-of negates the inherent temperature differential).",16,disappointed
17,17,1756,"Changdeokgung Palace was close to our hotel. The entrance cost 3000 KW for Palace itself and Palace Garden had a separate price. If you have been to China and other Asia you would be probably disappointed, so was I. The Palace looks like Chinese but cheap, it is small and low like few other things in Korea. Blooming trees were really beautiful over there. But in general it was not a Palace but traditional mansion.",17,disappointed
18,18,1785,"This palace is on the World Heritage List and deserves to be. If you only see one palace in Seoul, make sure it is Changdeokgung. This palace eschews the rigid, identical layout of the other palaces and has more character to it thanks to the lovely gardens and more of the rooms having furniture in them. I took the free English guided tour of the palace and learnt lots about how the palace was used and who lived there. The Secret Garden tour was also enjoyable, seeing all the little ponds and pavilions tucked away in the extensive, forested grounds that feel a world away from the modern city around you. I was disappointed by the other palaces of Seoul, but Changdeokdung is something special and a nice place to visit.",18,disappointed
19,19,1859,"I was feeling a little disappointed with Seoul after traveling around Japan previously until I came here. I got there just in time for a secret garden tour and headed straight there. It was amazing, the guide had lots of great information and there are some beautiful spots. It should be the no.1 thing to do in Seoul!",19,disappointed
20,20,1865,Again another beautiful palace. Lovely to have a wonder around and have a few coffees. This is a must visit for any visitor to Seoul and I don't think you will be disappointed. Plenty of photo opportunities- make sure you don't miss the Secret Garden!!  Hopefully a helpful tip- you can walk between Changdeokgung and Changgyeonggung Palace. We stupidly exited the latter and got hop on bus to next stop. Think we missed some sights doing this.,20,disappointed
21,21,2023,"We planned to visit Changdeokgung Palace because it is one of the World Heritage properties and Secret Garden (inside Changdeokgung Palace) with beautiful Autumn leaves.  There are two kinds of tickets, one is for Changdeokgung Palace only (3,000 won) & the other is Changdeokgung Palace + Secret Garden (8,000 won with tour guide). We made ticket reservation on its website 1-week before the trip, all Chinese & English speaking tour guides were fully booked, we Chinese only had to book a ""Japanese"" speaking tour guide at 12:30 pm. If you want to know every place of its history, it is highly recommended to make the reservation on its official website as early as possible for a understandable language. No advance payment is required.  Upon arrival at the Secret Garden, we were a bit disappointed because it's too early for the beautiful Autumn leaves at the end of October, not much were seen. However, the weather is nice and comfortable, it took us 2.5 - 3 hours to walk, take pictures and enjoy the environment (without following the Japanese tour guide). It is a nice & relaxing place to visit. We may learn more of Its history on its official website or UNESCO's.",21,disappointed
22,22,2197,This is the best preserved palace in Seoul so the guide books tell us. We were a little disappointed. We went on an English tour. Our guide spoke very good English but she started her commentary to quickly. There were many places where the group had to move in single file and with the best will in the world it took time for the whole group to gather. In the meantime the guide had started her commentary when about 6 people ( out of a group of 20 or more) had arrived so we missed quite a bit.  Although the buildings were very interesting they were completely bare. It would have been good to see some of the rooms furnished appropriately. Another day I visited Unhyeongung Palace which is just down the road and although a lot smaller I found it more interesting because many of the rooms were furnished and even had mannequins of the royal family of the time in them.Tthis palace was free but we paid a modest amount at Chagdeokgung Palace.,22,disappointed
23,23,2218,"We were disappointed. Although this site is nicely preserved, there wasn't much to see. There was an extra entrance fee for the secret garden, which according to the guide books was the gem of this site. We didn't go in unfortunately. Strollers? Impossible to lug up the huge stone steps in front of every building. Families with young children need to be better prepared than we were.",23,disappointed
24,24,2242,"Such a beautiful place. This palace was recommended to us over a visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace as it's meant to be prettier. Obviously we went with this recommendation and whilst I can't compare, I can say that we were not disappointed. We made it in time to take the secret garden tour - the only way to see the gardens and the back of the palace, including the prince's private get-away and the servant quarters. The tour guide was was full of really interesting facts and it gave us insight into how Koreans lived in that era, eg. raised rooms that were cooler in Korea's stinking hot summer's. I really, really wish that the library was available on the tour, however we could only look up at it. The courtyard with the pond and the library is stunning. We could've stayed for ages, but we were so tired from walking around. Take some snacks as the shop there only had drinks!",24,disappointed
25,25,2277,"Having been to the Forbidden Palace in Beijing... nothing else could really compare, so I was a bit biased! This palace was very easy to find and easy to get to which was great. The inside was quite nice too, although it is mostly empty rooms... There wasnt that many visitors when I went so you could see everything and take decent pictures without a swarm of people in your photos. However, I was rather disappointed that they had 'sold out' of tickets for the secret garden! It was the main reason I went... I don't really know how tickets for a garden could sell out... anyway... so you've got to go super early to get tickets for that! I think I went around midday and there were no tickets left. Anyway, this is quite a nice place to go for history and photos. Theres a small coffee shop and souvenir shop inside.",25,disappointed
26,26,2390,"we really feel disappointed because we didn't have much time to explore secret garden. i heard this one is the highlight of this palace. we know this palace from rooftop prince, one of korean drama.there was not many tourist visit this palace. this palace is near with buckhon hanok village",26,disappointed
27,27,2568,"The Changdeokgung Palace is very close to the subway station, with 1-2 mins walk. The Palace is an ordinary one, if you expect a grand palace, Changdeokgung will make you disappointed. There is a Secret Garden inside the Palace, you need to buy another ticket for it, but I think the garden is not so interesting, compare to the imperial garden in China or Europe. The Changdeokgung Palace is a good place to know more about the Korean history, so if you haven't been there, it is worth to visit.",27,disappointed
28,28,2597,The one thing that I wanted to visit whilst in Korea were the palaces as it brings so much history to the city. I wasnt disappointed when we went to visit and we managed to see the Changing of the guards too.,28,disappointed
29,29,2644,"The palace itself is average. You cannot go inside any of the buildings, but the grounds are well kept and the exteriors are well renovated. The guided tours are awful, so don't waste your time. The guides rush from location to location and begin speaking as soon as they reach the next spot, but before the majority of the travelers have caught up. Even with a microphone, we could not hear what one of our guide was saying she spoke so softly. The groups, especially for the Huwon, are massive, so that also makes it challenging to keep up and hear your tour. Also, the guides dictate, verbatim, what is in the pamphlet they hand you when you buy your tickets, so you could easily have a much more enjoyable self-guided tour on your own schedule. While we were able to tour the Huwon on our own, I do believe for the most part, you are required to be with a guide. The Huwon was beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there photographing it. Do not expect your typical floral garden- there are very few flowers in the Huwon, which our friends were disappointed to discover. The garden features nicely maintained buildings, some small ponds and lots of greenery on well shaded pathways. The Huwon is a great stop in Korea.",29,disappointed
30,30,2650,We did a tour around the palace which was interesting. Although we were disappointed in the lack of colour of the place. Especially after visiting castles in Europe,30,disappointed
31,31,2666,"Beautiful grounds. The Secret Garden add on is a worthwhile visit. The gardens are Korean style - mainly trees and shrubs. So if you're expecting a beautiful English garden with lots of flowers, you may be disappointed.  There is a great FREE eponymous iPhone app for the palace. It serves as an audio guide and GPS map. Because of its size, it would be best to download it before going.",31,disappointed
32,32,2686,"We walked through the Biwon (secret garden) in the frigid Seoul weather of Christmas Day. Actually we were at the Changdeokgung Palace the day before but we were told we just missed the last English tour of the day. So on the 24th we only got to see the palace itself. If you are a foreigner it is assumed that you need an English tour. In the cold short winter days of December (may be even January and February), there were only two English tours in a day. It was at 11:30am and 2:30 pm. (It is worth double checking these times for yourself) We were not the only ones who were disappointed and had to go back a second time. (We were also made to pay the palace tour again) The palace itself was ok. In spite of the cold and the run around, the Biwon was worth it. In the palace compound proper one can still see the city buildings around. Once inside the garden it was a hidden world, and a very photogenic place. The idea is closer to a rambling Chinese garden with hills, ponds, gates, teahouses and pavilions than a controlled Japanese Zen meditation garden. Enjoy! The gift shop/Cafe carries good souvenirs but somewhat pricey. On the way out, west of the palace compound there are a few restaurants. For very delicious and very sizeable meat dumplings and oyster/fish pancakes, Buckchon Restaurant is highly recommended. (This place has tables and chairs) The service was also very good.",32,disappointed
33,33,2698,"I spent a couple of hours visiting this palace, taking one of the few English-language tours available. It was very crowded on the day, as the other main palace was closed so all tourists flocked here. Even so, it was an interesting visit and an opportunity to learn a few things about Korean history and culture. Sadly I did not make it to the secret garden, as I ran out of time, but this attraction is well worth a visit! A word of warning for people with physical impairments. There are some extremely steep steps to climb so don't be disappointed if you won't be able to see every part of it. Still, there should be plenty to make it worth your while.",33,disappointed
34,34,2712,"As someone who taught English in Korea for almost 20 years (we left Korea in 1983), I was very disappointed in the English guided tour. The guide's content was not suited to foreigners' knowledge or experience, and the pronunciation and word-usage was abominable. Towards the end of the tour very few of the tourists were even trying to listen to the guide. I must say, however, that I was impressed with the tremendous improvement in the English language of signs in this palace as well as other historical sites we visited in Korea.",34,disappointed
35,0,57,It was a really nice afternoon sadly the secret garden was closed apparently you had to prebook tickets which we were unaware of the sign said for covid but I met a person the next day who said she went the same day and possibly time as us so prebook those tickets if you want to see the gardens For the rest of it I thought is was much more beautiful than Gyeongbokgun Palace but it did seem a bit smaller Well worth the visit if youre in Seoul,35,bit
36,1,69,Always like visiting palaces and this is no exception Its one of the smaller palaces in Seoul but still quite interesting to stroll around Theres a separate section which is called the Secret Garden and theres a separate admission to that An easy way to spend a morning or afternoon discovering a bit about Seouls past,36,bit
37,2,90,"Stunning palace. I have a lot of time in Seoul and Korea so going to see all the palaces. If your time is limited, definitely do this one. Time your visit accordingly with the mandatory guided tour of the Secret Garden. Annoyingly they appear to change timings so check online the day before your visit. I got there at 09:00 when they opened. I was the first person inside. I walked around the palace grounds myself for just over an hour and then did the English guided Secret Garden tour at 10:30 which finished around noon. Lasts about one and a half hours. You can leave the tour after fifty minutes as the last part is quite a bit of walking including uphill. For most of us it is fine but others were struggling with the heat even though it was early and parts of it are uphill so be mindful. I spent in total three hours there. Separate ticket for the palace and Secret Garden. They do have guided tours of the palace itself but to be honest, you can easily do this yourself. They give you a booklet plus there are information boards. Suggest going early as soon as it opens. It was beautiful and peaceful and you could freely walk around and enjoy the setting, also getting some good photographs. When I left at noon, it was much busier. Grounds are clean and well laid out. The palace was stunning. I loved the details of the doors and the architecture. There is a cafe and what appeared to be an art or souvenir shop on the premises. I didn't bother with it. Take water with especially if you are there for three hours like me. There are restrooms too. My thoughts. The Secret Garden is apparently the highlight. Whilst this was nice, I think the weather will contribute towards your experience. We had a lovely day and the sun shining with the reflection on the water and the colours of the leaves made the gardens look very pretty. However, we can't control the weather and I would suggest thinking about this if you have a day with bad weather. Parts of the garden were nice but other parts started to look the same. I started to get bored as did a lot of the group. I was glad I went though. The guide was difficult to understand (although the tour was in English) but there are information boards as well along the route which also provide useful facts. They limit the number of people on the tour so purchase a ticket as soon as you arrive.",37,bit
38,3,97,"I really loved the feel of this palace, like a haven of peace in the heart of the busy city. It is really beautiful. Because of Covid there was no guided tour or audio guide available but it is still worth the trip. The only negative thing is I had to get a second ticket to visit the secret garden. It is a a bit a shame that you can’t buy a combo ticket",38,bit
39,4,159,"We had very limited time at Seoul, so I only had the option to visit 1 palace during my trip. As we rented hanbok at Bukchon Hanok Village, we decided to go to Changdeokgung as it is a bit closer. The palace is not that big, but we had ample time taking pictures within the palace as there were not many visitors on that day. I wish we could have more time to join the tour for secret garden.",39,bit
40,5,166,"Beautiful! Definitely worth walking around for a bit - especially since it's so close to Bukchon Hanok Village, Insa-dong, etc. Didn't do the secret garden tour, but wish I had. Gorgeous colors, as is typical with Korean architecture.",40,bit
41,6,182,"We took a tour (booked thru trip advisor) where we had a private guide and a choice of destinations. We chose this one since we could do Gyeongbokgung by ourselves. A bit smaller (less walking), but more time for guide to explain things.",41,bit
42,7,191,"Having seen old architecture in surrounding countries, the Korean style shows its own characteristics - a bit more austere than Chinese temples - and different color palette.",42,bit
43,8,236,"I’d premise this with the fact it was an exceptionally hot and humid day we visited Changdeokgung palace which definitely impacted our enjoyment. The gardens are the main reason to visit and they are lovely (no flowers, all trees and greenery when we went in June - well maintained) but I would say beyond walking around the gardens, there wasn’t much to do. The entry price was only 1,000 won which is cheap but for that you can’t get inside any of the buildings and when it is hot, it’s a bit relentless.  So in short I’d recommend a short visit but not on a hot day.",43,bit
44,9,257,"It’s unclear what, if anything, is the original structure. It has been reconstructed with bits from another palace which makes it all seem a bit pointless, especially since they point out that many structures were modified in the process.

You can’t go into any of the ”historical” buildings (from the 1990’s..?) which means you only see exteriors and the occasional glance through and open window or door.

To enter the garden you have to join the English speaking guided tour which only runs 3-4 times a day, and since it’s a limited number of people per tour, chances are likely that you won’t get tickets unless you booked in advance. Although I can’t say I’m terribly disappointed in not getting a spot for the garden since I wasn’t very impressed with the palace to begin with.  I wouldn’t recommend this one.",44,bit
45,10,291,"Caveat to this review is I’ve likely seen too many palaces over the years, and nothing in this one stands out. What also detracts from the experience is that all the buildings were only built within the last 150 years as the originals were destroyed. So you are seeing fairly modern materials and construction techniques. It feels a bit staged as a result.  If you’re short on time and have seen an Asian palace before then you can afford to skip this one.  Final point: ‘the secret garden’ can only be accessed via the scheduled tours, which appear to depart every 2 hours. I didn’t do it.",45,bit

The secret garden is a wondrous place. A bit of a walk, but not too difficult (had one guy on crutches in the walking tour). ₩5,000 entry into the secret garden if wearing a hanbok (traditional Korean dress) or ₩10,000 normally. All in all, a splendid venture into the history of South Korea.",48,bit

However, we find that the morning/noon sun was quite draining. And there were some uphill and downhill that we need to climb. It might be difficult, if not impossible for people who have mobility problems. The garden itself and the scenery was very nice, but after touring the garden for 1.5 hours, we were not so keen to look at the palace anymore (as we have seen the bigger one the day before). Overall, I would recommend this for those who likes to look at architecture and learn about history. But probably it won't be very interesting for young kids.",50,bit

The palaces looked similar on the outside but the decorations here were a bit more colourful.

I stayed back for the first few buildings, then decided to explore on my own, since I wanted to get nice pictures without the whole group in them (the tour is limited to 100 people). I would recommend that. You can always go back and catch up with the group, or ask the guide some questions. The gardens are so beautiful, we were lucky with the weather; sunshine and blue sky. It was just amazing and I took a million pictures (see below :-)), a total MUST DO if you love gardens. I would go back and book the tour again, it's so beautiful!",52,bit

I would advise getting the integrated palace pass as it is more worthwhile for visiting all the palaces and Jongmyo. As long as you take the guided tour it wouldn’t seem like a blur of palaces. Each one had its unique features and place in history. In spring the flowers are lovely and the architecture layout here I feel is the best of the palaces. It is a lot of walking for old folks to do and a bit of uphill and downhill especially at the last leg of the Huwon tour, so wear good walking shoes. The guide does give breaks at each point though and there is a toilet inside. The cafe and souvenir shop in the palace grounds is really nice do check it out. No food served though.",53,bit

Reasons: 1. mostly not as crowded 2. Wonderful garden (especially in autumn and spring// In summer more shade then Gyeongbokgung! 3. A bit closer to the part of the city with traditional houses and many neat coffee shops. 4. Closer to Insadong 5. Closer to Jongmyo Shrine 6. Neighbouring Changgyeong palace is worth a visit, too.  In summer there are night tours through the beautifully lit up premises. You need to reserve tickets beforehand!  What you should do at Gyeongbokgung however is to watch the change of the guards.

The wait to get tickets was around 30 minutes - which I didn't mind a bit as it was fascinating watching the locals, young and old arrive in their beautiful traditional dress. The Palace offered lots of history and insight into the culture. Constructed in 1405 as a secondary palace of the Joseon Dynasty and rebuilt in 1610 after being destroyed during the Japanese invasion. It then served as the main palace for 270 years. The Koreans in traditional dress added to the intrigue. We paid extra to go into the secret garden and were pleased we had. The autumn colours were beautiful.

For example, it does offer a bit more history and authenticity as it is quite a bit older than the other palace which was only recently rebuilt.

It was consisted of so many halls most of which were huge and spacious and were used for the most formal state events, coronation ceremonies and receptions of foreign envoys.  A beautiful secret garden Is situated at the back of the Palace which enhanced the unique architectural structure of the pavilions and was intended as a place for relaxation of the King and his royal family. It was also used as a venue for various activities to include sports competition most notably in archery during those days.

When you first arrive, you can buy an entrance ticket to the palace, and at the same time can ask for an entry ticket to the ""Secret Garden."" This allows you entry at a specified time but doesn't cost anything extra. I've gone twice and once they just let us in at that time and we were free to wander at will. The second time, there was an English-speaking tour guide who showed us a few of the most important sights within the garden. It is amazing how quickly you feel immersed in nature, even though you know you are in the center of a bustling city. It is so quiet and serene - just the thing when city life gets too overwhelming. Definitely wear your walking shoes - the paths are smooth and wide, but the garden is very large and hilly so it requires a bit of stamina to see it all. Young children or anyone with limited mobility will find it tough to see the whole thing.",59,bit

The secret garden was so exclusive but need abit of walking up and down, after all not too bad because the tour guide was in slow pace allowing guests to walk slowly to see, look around and experience.

You have to have a guided tour and there were a lot of people when we were there which made it a bit tricky to hear, plus we had to keep stopping to wait for everyone to catch up / take photos etc which made it quite a long tour.

A UNESCO world heritage site, this palace retained several elements dating from the Three Kingdoms of Korea period and one such element is the fact that the buildings of Changdeokgung blend with the topography of the site. It is significantly less crowded than Gyeongbokgung and it made the palace experience a whole lot sweeter.  Housed at the back of the palace is a 32 hectare rear garden, also known as Huwon — this garden was originally constructed for the royal family and palace women, incorporating a lotus pond, pavilions, landscaped lawns … and a royal library. Entrance into this part of the palace complex, is ticketed and by guided tours only. I enjoyed every bit of my visit to the Secret Garden, with its gorgeous landscape and architecture.

Our friend showed us around the rest of the area and still knew enough to tell us a bit about the palace, so it was all good.

It's historic and evocative, although the actual building interiors and surroundings are a bit austere and lifeless, as opposed to a more full-functioning actual monastery. The buildings themselves have been very nicely restored, however, and the grounds are impressive. Since the palace is right downtown it is easily accessible by subway, downtown hotels, etc.  Seeing only this sight/palace, as opposed to something more current and vibrant for the modern population would be a mistake, but if you have a few hours this is the kind of place that gives a sense for the history of Korea.

Word of warning to the infirm, the garden tour has some quite steep climbs and quite a lot of older and more overweight vistors found the pace a bit intense, especially in the heat.

The guide focuses on telling you what happened in each building and how they were used as well as fun little stories about the people who lived there. It was a tour unique to this place and moved at a good speed. The garden tour really depends on the guide. My first time he was fantastic and gave funny stories about each place and the second he let us wander alone a bit more.

Worth a visit if you have the time - about 1:30-2 hours is good enough. Then it becomes a bit repetitive. If you get a chance walk around the area in the city because there is lots to do there as well, not just sightseeing.",104,bit

I can see why they need it to be guided as it's a wide open space with a few built up areas connected by paths.

Unless you are in good physical and aerobic shape, save yourself 5,000 won and give it a pass.  The guide for my group had full command of English, was cool and laid back, was thorough yet concise and, most importantly, went at a fairly leisurely pace. This allowed people to admire the sights, fall back a bit to photograph along the way and rest a bit, as the tour is physically demanding. [If anyone affiliated with the Imperial Household Agency in Kyoto reads this: You might want to take this tour to see how you should be conducting yours... seriously].  The walk is pleasant, the sights are pleasant. I was a little disappointed that the structural highlight of the tour, Juhamnu Pavilion, was “view at a distance” only. Additionally, I was a little surprised that the structures and grounds of many of the sights were not kept up as one would expect, given the garden’s significance. One of the sights (I believe it was Seonhyangjae) was under complete renovation; while that was bad for us, it will be good for those who visit when it’s completed.  The tour was vastly more valuable from a historical viewpoint than was from a visual standpoint. A Japanese garden it was not. I’m sure in the autumn it will be more visually compelling. This is a subjective opinion but I’m very torn as to whether or not it paid for itself (obviously they have to pay the tour guides which adds to their cost though, so therein lies the bind).  One thing the tour is, though, and that’s shady. If it’s uncomfortably warm or hot, you might want to schedule the tour to coincide with the height of the mid-day sun (although the strenuousness of some of the climbs sort-of negates the inherent temperature differential).",117,bit

They also call it the ""rear"" garden which is a much more fitting name. its a large area with some natural pools and very quiet areas. After the first three stopping points it gets a bit hilly so those who are not as ambulatory or are in a wheelchair/use a cane/have problems walking easily on incline surfaces should probably skip the last two stops.

When we were there, the tickets for the 11.30am slot were sold out by 10.30am. Some customers were sadly turned away. Fortunately, we pre-booked our tickets online. If you are dead serious on visiting the Secret Garden, you are advised to pre-book the tickets.  We enjoyed the Secret Garden tour tremendously, even though the scenery was not ideal, as it is winter now, so the trees look very bare, and the lakes were frozen. This was because we had a very patient and knowledgeable tour guide, who share a lot of interesting history about each section / building in the garden, with the group. This tour may not be suitable for toddlers and senior citizens, as some of the paths are rather steep (upwards and downwards) and may be a bit tiring.  Also, do take note that the tour is very long (over 1 hour). So, if you are rushing for time, this may not work for you.  The garden is really beautiful in autumn or spring (the tour guide showed us some pictures). I might return for another visit in the right season.  A plus point of having a mandatory guided tour in here, is that the garden is never crowded and you can easily get good photo. shots of the surrounding area.

It was wonderful listening to her explain. This place has a few English information boards around so you can walk around by yourself if you want to.

I can imagine how nice it would be right smack in the middle of autumn when all the leaves would turn colors and also in Cherry Blossom season.  It was a nice walk. We got there in time for the English group and we had a park guide who showed us around. There are some steep areas and if you can't join the group, they will ask you to walk back the same way to the entrance, as a guide is required to be with you at all times. We walked through several attractions, I think they were five stops. At each stop, the guide provides an introduction and overview and gives us some time to walk around the area and take photos. We made it to the fourth stop, but there was a very steep path going down. Since we learned that they are just going to make a round and come back the same way, we decided to wait for the group and we were allowed to do so, as long as we're in line of sight of the security folks in the park.  The walk brings you out a different way, and we end up back at the main entrance of Changdeokgung Palace. So I made my way back to the palace grounds to explore the rest of the palace. It's big and spacious and since I had a short time to finish exploring the palace, I just made a quick run for the main attractions. I love the architecture. I just wish I had more time to understand the history of each area. I guess I'll just have to read up on them.  After the visit to the secret garden and the palace, we were all poofed. So we stayed at the main courtyard and found quiet a place to sit. It was actually nice sitting there with the autumn cold wind blowing our direction. We all sat in a relaxing position and had some time to check emails while we were on the road and to find a place to eat nearby.

This is a UNESCO World Heritage site and while we would never want it turned into a Disney version of a palace, it would be great to see an exhibit (drawings, models, film) of what all of these buildings were used for and what they may have looked like when the palace was inhabited. Next to the Secret Garden entrance was an entrance to another palace, the Changoyeonggung Palace. It was only about $1 each and it turned out to be the highlight of our day. I understand an additional fee for the Secret Garden, but would have preferred that the visit was not limited to a guided tour.

Outside the secret garden, I personally didn’t find the palace buildings too interesting. Having already seen the Forbidden City and summer palace in Beijing, I found Changdeokgung to be quite similar in terms of architecture and layout of the palace buildings. Of course, there will be subtle differences between Korean and Chinese palaces. As with many east asian non-functional palaces, you only get to walk on the outside for the most part.

Another day I visited Unhyeongung Palace which is just down the road and although a lot smaller I found it more interesting because many of the rooms were furnished and even had mannequins of the royal family of the time in them.Tthis palace was free but we paid a modest amount at Chagdeokgung Palace.,155,bit

While Gyeongbokgung Palace is the more popular and larger attraction, Changdeokgung offers a more personal and intimate experience because of its smaller (but still expansive) compound and the lovely Secret Garden. There are two guided tours here - the outer main buildings and the Secret Garden. I highly recommend both. With so much history and information to absorb, it would be an injustice to the place if you walk around on your own. The Secret Garden, by the way, can only be accessed via the official guided tour. Our tour guides on both tours were outstanding and spoke excellent English. Their knowledge was, of course, extraordinary, but they also made great effort to talk clearly and slowly. The buildings of the palace were most interesting to me.This palace as I understand it was mainly for living more than ceremonies. It was fascinating to see living quarters of royalty as well as those that served it. Spanning centuries, the palace remained in use until the last century. The tours took us not only through the buildings, but indeed through time. The Secret Garden was fun but busy with scores of people joining the tour. While hearing the tour guide commentary was difficult at times, we did get the chance to see some striking pavilions by pools and walk along tree-lined paths that really made my day.

183,148,2498,"We visited this palace in early April and really enjoyed our time here. Having already walked around Gyeongbokgung a couple of days earlier, we decided to take both tour options. You can visit the palace without a tour but the secret garden is only accessible with a guided tour. There are 3 tours per day in English (the website is very good and gives full timings on everything). We got there about 5 minutes before the English tour of the palace started and managed to buy tickets and still be on time. Entrance fee is entirely reasonable, especially by UK standards.  The palace tour started promptly and the guide was certainly not hanging around. We were marshalled off, had brief stops at each of the main points and marched on again. I felt a bit herded about but still enjoyed learning a bit more about the palace and culture therein. The guide's English was excellent but you still need to ensure that you keep close enough (the different rhythm and pitch of Asian speakers means you have to concentrate to understand everything). The whole palace tour took just under an hour and finished right by the entrance to the secret garden. The secret garden tour started just after the palace tour finished. There were far more people in this tour than in the palace tour so I suspect not everybody went for the palace tour beforehand. The guide's English this time was even better than the first one. In addition, we were given time at several stops to take photos, take in the scenery and just take things a bit slower. The secret garden tour took the full 1.5 hours and by the end of it our two daughters were both a bit bored. However, this was largely due to the fact that it was only 8 degrees and drizzling. Having spent 2.5 hours outside, we were all getting very cold (despite wearing winter coats and gloves) so I suggest you dress up warm if visiting outside summer. I would definitely recommend this place. The garden in particular is beautiful and you really wouldn't notice that you are in the middle of a busy city. Guides are very informative.

If one is keen to see this ""Secret Garden"" then advanced booking is best. It seems the regular ticket will allow one to see many structures in this palace complex, but cover less than half of the area (Huwon is rather large).  The brochure which came with the ticket is an excellent one and quite sufficient for navigating through the complex, with rather substantial information for identifying unique features of the buildings and understanding the architecture. Changdeokgung minus Huwon seems much smaller than Gyeongbokgung and takes a shorter time to visit. However after seeing much in Gyeongbokgung, this required a bit more effort to appreciate. Also, worth noting is that the crowds seemed unavoidable here, probably due to the small size of Changdeokgung, the fact that it was visited later in the day and on a weekend.  Thought the blue tiled roof of Seonjeongjeon was rather unique, but personally found the Nakseonjae Complex stood out the most because of its simplicity, reflecting the character of the King who lived here.  Overall, a very good visit to Changdeokgung, and a worthy inclusion to exploring Seoul. Note that this palace is closed on Mondays. Also there is a month-valid combination ticket to visit the other three palaces and Jongmyo shrine nearby.

Do not expect a grand palace as Gyeongbokgung. If you want to visit, come for the history not for the sight.  Unlike Gyeongbokgung which is connected to the subway station, the Changaokgung is a bit of a walk from the subway station. Just when I thought I missed it, there it was. This palace does not boast a large foot print and does not have as many grand structures as Gyeongbokgung. There is no guards nor ceramoney. There is not much to see really. The english tour is only about $3 and the guide tried her best and made the palace tour more interesting than it was.  There is a secret garden behind the palace, which occupies most of the land and requires a seperate entrance which I will described below. The tour costs $5 and the tour guide also did a great job. However, the garden is similar to our community garden back home, with a few traditional Korean structures scattered around. It is a hilly garden and not the best for the physically challenged.  If anyone is planning on a day tour to cover this palace, the secret garden, Insa-dong, and the village, one needs to be fit. If you are like me who only hikes 2-5 miles a day, I recommend skipping the secret garden (or the Changdaekgung all together) and use your time and energy for other things more exciting in Seoul, which are plentiful.

You can leave the tour after fifty minutes as the last part is quite a bit of walking including uphill. For most of us it is fine but others were struggling with the heat even though it was early and parts of it are uphill so be mindful. I spent in total three hours there. Separate ticket for the palace and Secret Garden. They do have guided tours of the palace itself but to be honest, you can easily do this yourself. They give you a booklet plus there are information boards. Suggest going early as soon as it opens. It was beautiful and peaceful and you could freely walk around and enjoy the setting, also getting some good photographs. When I left at noon, it was much busier. Grounds are clean and well laid out. The palace was stunning. I loved the details of the doors and the architecture. There is a cafe and what appeared to be an art or souvenir shop on the premises. I didn't bother with it. Take water with especially if you are there for three hours like me. There are restrooms too. My thoughts. The Secret Garden is apparently the highlight. Whilst this was nice, I think the weather will contribute towards your experience. We had a lovely day and the sun shining with the reflection on the water and the colours of the leaves made the gardens look very pretty. However, we can't control the weather and I would suggest thinking about this if you have a day with bad weather. Parts of the garden were nice but other parts started to look the same. I started to get bored as did a lot of the group. I was glad I went though.

200,4,103,"My sister had previously traveled to Seoul and she told me that to her, the Changdeokgung palace was the most impressive one of all palaces in Seoul. Yes, I agree. It is second in size after its neighbor the Gyenongbokgung palace, the main palace. It is a secondary palace that was used as the main palace at times of disaster or war. As mentioned before, the main palace was Gyenongbokgung.  Changdeokgung is also a fully restored palace. The palace was destroyed by the Japanese at the beginning of the XX century during the occupation of Korea. Japan wanted to get rid of any vestige of Korean culture. The palace is very well restored. The main hall is monumental. The palace buildings are lovely and have a more disorganized distribution when compared with the order of the Gyenongbokgung palace. The lack of order makes it charming; in some areas you will feel that you are walking through a labyrinth that surprises you at every corner. The colors of the walls and roof are phenomenal! One of the buildings preserves its original blue color roof; it is a very dark, shiny blue that is unique of Korea! There are many places where you can take pictures and relax under the shade.  You need approximately 2 hours to visit the palace. Once you finish, go to the secret gardens. The secret gardens belong to this palace; however, the entrance is separate and you need a different ticket. I recommend to buy the ticket that covers the 4 palaces of the Joseon dinasty, the garden, and the Jongmyo santuary. It is very cheap!  The place is very well labeled.

202,6,122,"The buildings are lovely here, but for me the main reason to visit is the secret garden. It is wonderful! You enter the garden with a group according to language, but to be honest I ditched them as soon as I was inside as I wanted to do my own thing and some peace and quiet. I was lucky enough to visit during autumn and it didn't disappoint...it was full of beautiful colours. You will need a couple of hours to do the place justice and be prepared to walk up and down and then down and up...totally worth it though.  If you arrive in hanbok (Korean traditional dress) you get for free!",202,hour
203,7,134,"The palace covers a large area. So be prepared to walk in comfy footwear. There are many sections of the palace to explore and a conservatory / green house and a lake. Need at least a day to cover most grounds which we ran out of time as we were busy taking photos at every turn (almost!).  There is a map of the palace located in various section so you know where you are going. In total about 15 sections.  The autumn scape is of vibrant and fiery red as the maple trees / leaves change for the season. Very colourful and scenic. Worth a visit.  You can also hire the traditional attire - Hanbok from nearby shop. We bought rented our Hanbok via an app for 4-hour and it only cost us US$15 each, and also get free admission in to the palace.  If you are in Seoul for a few days try this experience!",203,hour
204,8,141,It is by far my favourite site in all Seoul. The palaces are interesting but the big highlight is the secret garden. The foliage in November was so so pretty. I wanted to spend just one hour and ended spending most of the afternoon. It was just super relaxing.,204,hour
205,9,150,"Like Gyeongbokgung Palace, my wife and I been to the day before, Changdeokgung Palace offers visitors many, many photography opportunities.  My wife rented a hanbok from one of the numerous hanbok rental shops in the palace's vicinity and for 4 hours, we toured the palace snapping away on my camera. Just like Gyeongbokgung Palace, we had no idea what the significance of any of historical building/ artifact we were looking at since we were without a guide. But hey, our family album has been significantly fattened up after that trip.  If you are into culture and history, follow a guide.  Pro Tip: The man at the entrance taking visitors' admission tickets, told me that because my wife was wearing a hanbok, she did not need to pay admission. However, the line back at the ticketing booth was too long so I could not be bothered to go back to refund her ticket.  So, do not quote me on this. Go find out if this is indeed the case and save yourself some Korean won!",205,hour

Highly recommended you go visiting the garden as it is very serene and beautiful and it is an easy walk.",206,hour

It was quite hot the day we visited, but shade was abundant and the various buildings were very interesting. Signs were helpful to gain insights and understanding. We enjoyed our 2 hour stroll among the sights and gardens. It is well worth the visit.",209,hour
210,14,187,"The palace is one of history and culture. It is worthwhile to book a docine or guide to take you around as there are statures and carvings that have meanings, as well as entrances that were for kings or servants, which you wouldn't necessarily know about. The palace and grounds are huge! we went on a warm day in summer and it was very pleasant however we did spend hours walking. The palace is free to walk around, however the King's gardens are not, so try to book a session the day before if it is a busy tourist time.",210,hour
211,15,194,We booked hanboks online before our arrival so were admitted for free and spent 2 1/2 hours wandering the grounds and taking pictures. We saw many Korean school groups who asked to take pictures with my blond kids and read us paragraphs in English. Everyone was so friendly. We lucked into watching the changing of the guard so look for the times on the website. Very little shade there so a hat or umbrella would be nice. Don’t miss it!,211,hour

The tour is conducted hourly and take you into the inner part of the palace compound with a guide who gives further insight and explanation. Here you will be able to see more pavilion, ponds and gardens. The tour takes 90 minutes and involved walking up and down the hilly path.",212,hour
213,17,198,The palace has nothing special but is good for the Korean Traditional dress called Hanbok experience and photos.  Just accors the road ( opposite to this palace) there is a shop for Traditional dress rental. They charge around kRW 15000 for 2 hours rental for dress. They provide all facilities like rentals lockers within this price. Ladies hair dress is additional KRW 5000. Overall a good experience to go for this.  Please also note that in case you are wearing the Traditional clothes the entry fee to palace is waived off.  The place is easily accessible through public transport.  The palace may be hot is summer and mostly uncovered in case of rain. So better carry an umbrella in summary or rainy season.  No F&B option in palace. Better to carry your water bottles.  They have washroom inside.,213,hour
214,18,206,"Having lived in Korea for almost a year now, I think it's fair to say that I've had my fair share of temples and palaces. I almost didn't go to this one, but I'm glad that I did! I like the flair and vibe of this palace a lot more than Gyeongbokgung. The layout of the palace made me feel like I was truly exploring ancient Korea. Make sure to try hanbok when you go (it was around ₩15,000 for 4 hours and the rental store that I went to was right across the street from Chandeokgung), as it authenticates the experience!",214,hour
215,19,210,"This is the most special of all the palaces and probably the one to visit in case you plan on doing one only. The palace is spacious with large open places. Tourists are not allowed inside much of the covered areas and most of the time you are out in the open. So it can be harsh during summers. But still if you are touring seoul this is one of the must do activities. Just be prepared for the walk and the sun. The secret garden tour is amazing and can only be taken as a guided tour of roughly 70 min duration in summers and 90 during other times. Most of cultural heritage sites including this palace in seoul are free to enter from Aug 10 -25, due to National Liberation Day celebrations...however secret garden tour is paid and needs to be booked atleast a day prior. There is a souvenir and refreshment shop inside for the tourists. From the inside one can also tour the Changgyeonggung palace since the two are connected. The entire tour including the palaces and secret garden can take from 2-3 hours.",215,hour
216,20,222,"This palace is not as crowded and has a huge secret garden or forbidden garden that occupies about 60% of the palace compound. The garden was only accessible to the Korean kings and royal family in the past. The palace itself is not big. There are free guided tours of palace around 1 hour available in english, chinese and korean. The palace entrance fee is very affordable at around USD3/pax. Garden guided tour fee is a separate fee at USD4/pax and garden tour takes 70 mins. Worth a visit.",216,hour
217,21,223,"This palace is smaller than Gyeongbokgung palace, but it is still very large, and unlike the larger one, has more original buildings. I recommend taking the english language tour. I feel I got a lot more out of it than just looking at all the pretty buildings, but if you don't have time, grab an english map at the entrance. Also, the signs throughout are in several languages. I also took the secret garden tour, which costs extra. It took me several hours to see everything. I liked this palace best. The tourists and locals walking around in Hanboks made for good pictures too.",217,hour
218,22,224,This palace is small than Gyengbokgung but very beautiful with traditional architecture. There is a way links to the Deoksugung which have a lake and very unique glass house. It might take 2 hours to visit this place.,218,hour
219,23,227,"Absolutely magnificent palace complex. I spent about 5 hours wandering around the inner and outer court before exploring the palace itself and the secret gardens. I was mesmerised by it to be honest. I intended to spend a couple of hours, a half day at most, but ended up spending pretty much a whole day here. The gardens are extra, 5000 won, but are well worth it. The place is stunning obviously but don't rush through the inner and outer courtyards as they are just as enchanting. One of the best days I've had on tour in a long, longt ime and definitely the best and most beautiful attraction in Seoul. An absolute must-do in my opinion.",219,hour
220,24,228,My wife wanted to visit here and thus we did lol. It was okay - saw the changing of the guard and we walked around the grounds for an hour or so. I feel that once you have seen one Korean palace... you have seen them all. My better half enjoyed it...,220,hour
221,25,237,"Not as beautiful as the Gyeongbokgung to be honest and you must go to the secret garden following a guife, you cannot enter by yourself and it's not worth one and half hour..",221,hour
222,26,239,"Changdeokgung Palace is one of Korea's ""Five Grand Palaces'. It is definitely worth a visit. To explore the whole complex takes several hours, but a shorter visit is still very worthwhile. This was part of our tour of South Korea and Mongolia. As at other palaces in Sepul, there are many locals in traditional clothes. Although not required, it is best to have a guide at this site..",222,hour
223,27,240,A portion of palace grounds is limited to a daily quota of visitors and only accompanied by palace guide. This is the Secret Garden which was the recreational forest of the palace. About an hour the tour involves fair amount of walking and changes of elevation.,223,hour
224,28,243,Must see part of any visit to Seoul..in fact the main attraction. Many Asian and Korean visitors hire traditional dress for the visit which adds to the spectacle. There is a guard changing ceremony you can view at around 10.30A.M so time your visit...lasts around 15 minutes. Leave max two hours for a good tour around and as always best to visit with a guide to get the most of the history. Very modern and clean restrooms on site as well as a decent cafe. Some great views of the temple with the mountain backdrop.,224,hour

227,31,278,"If you have a half day, I would highly recommend this place for a visit. First time that I have visited this outstanding Korean Palace. Lots of great places to take that Korea picture to send back home. The old style of Korea past is all around you. The government has done a great job in saving this jewel for all time. My wife told me that not all of the grounds were not always open to the public.  Just my thoughts:  You will need at 3 or 4 hours to see most of the grounds.  Wear your tennis shoes (loose gravel and uneven stairs).  Even though it says handicap accessible, most of the palace is not set up for wheelchairs.  You will also have problems with the kids stroller.  Plenty of toilets throughout the grounds.  Anyways, bring the camera and have a great time (we did)!",227,hour
228,32,281,"Changdeokgung is divided into two major complexes, the palace complex and the secret garden complex. Each has its own tickets. The free entry perk of wearing hanbok (Korean traditional clothings) does not apply to Changdeokgung's secret garden. You still have to buy the ticket to get into the garden.  Perhaps because it was used as some sort of recreational lodge, Changdeokgung is constructed in a more scenic relax fashion than other palaces. I would say this is the Korean version of Versailles.  The rear garden has several interesting stops, but it will take quite an effort to walk down its hilly path. It definitely some stamina as the guide walk you roughly 1.5km up and down path. The garden is an GUIDED TOUR only section, you can't enter it alone. Make sure you check its schedule before you go.  The ideal duration to wander around at Changdeokgung, including its rear garden, can be 2hr 30 minutes. Its garden tour itself can last around 1hr 30minutes, spare yourself another one full hour to enjoy its palace complex. It is quite a spectacle as well.  Best time to visit Changdeokgung is early April (Spring, the cherry blossom season), and Autumn.",228,hour
229,33,291,"Caveat to this review is I’ve likely seen too many palaces over the years, and nothing in this one stands out. What also detracts from the experience is that all the buildings were only built within the last 150 years as the originals were destroyed. So you are seeing fairly modern materials and construction techniques. It feels a bit staged as a result.  If you’re short on time and have seen an Asian palace before then you can afford to skip this one.  Final point: ‘the secret garden’ can only be accessed via the scheduled tours, which appear to depart every 2 hours. I didn’t do it.",229,hour
230,34,297,"Lots of building but all of the same decor, A lot of the place was destroyed by the Japanese and been refurbished. Still worth a walk around expect to spend around an hour. Changdeokgung place is adjacent to Changgyonggung Place with an inter connecting gate, there is an entrance fee for both places. So ideal to tie in at the same time. Over 65's have free entry on proof of age to both place.You can pay extra and have a guided tour of the secret garden which takes around 1.5 hours.",230,hour
231,35,298,We decided to stroll through the gardens in full Hanbok. We rented them from the little shop across the traffic lights from the front gate. 15000KW for 2 hours. We then wandered the palace grounds (free entry) taking pictures. We were also asked to be in many other pictures from other tourists as we have very blond hair and blue eyes. It was a great experience. The gardens were beautiful with Cherry Blossom blooming everywhere along the pathways. Well worth the visit.,231,hour

233,37,326,This place was really cool - but would have appreciated it more if there were less people around! It was nice seeing an actual palace and the place was really huge! We only stayed here less than an hour because we had to return our hanboks. When you visit here it would be better if you have at least 2 hours so you can explore and enjoy the entire area! Also it would be a lot better to plan coming here not on a peak season like summer to avoid the crowd!,233,hour
234,38,341,"Changdeokgung (昌德宮) was built in 1412 and served as the secondary royal palace after Gyeongbokgung. The palace was burnt to ground in 1592 but then fully restored in 1618. Unlike Gyeongbokgung which was built on a leveled ground, Chandeokgung was built with better landscape design, with more trees and shrubs.  We reached the palace at around 3:15 pm, and spent around 1 hour and a half there. Due to the time constraint, we didn't visit the secret garden. Changdeokgung is smaller compares to Gyeongbokgung, and we are using the same way to go in and and out. Thus we won't miss out any of the hall in the palace.  The entrance fee for an adult is KRW 3000. Secret garden is a part of the palace, but we need to pay extra KRW 5000 to enter the garden (the ticket can be bought only at the entrance).

The mix of preservation and reconstruction has been done beautifully. We were here for two hours, that was enough time to see all of the secret garden and most of the palace buildings. The secret garden tour is 100% worth the effort to get tickets. We booked online six days in advance. The online booking has a quirk, they don't email you your tickets, instead you need to save them as a pdf, print that out & take it to the ticket office.",237,hour

The secret garden is a wondrous place. A bit of a walk, but not too difficult (had one guy on crutches in the walking tour). ₩5,000 entry into the secret garden if wearing a hanbok (traditional Korean dress) or ₩10,000 normally. All in all, a splendid venture into the history of South Korea.",242,hour

The Garden is not big and with just a few buildings/attractions inside, many of which did not allow entry. The tour can be completed within 30 minutes. However, the guide prolonged the tour to more than one hour. It was very hot on a summer day with lots of mosiquitos, and no fun to stand in front of a lily pond for 20 minutes listening to the guide chatting with tourists on topics unrelated to the palace or the garden.

It might be difficult, if not impossible for people who have mobility problems. The garden itself and the scenery was very nice, but after touring the garden for 1.5 hours, we were not so keen to look at the palace anymore (as we have seen the bigger one the day before).

263,67,654,I would definitely recommend you dress the part when visiting the palaces around Seoul. It's a great place to check out the history of Korea and immerse yourself in the Korean culture. It's so much fun to dress up with your friends and take pictures. If your going to rent a hanbok (traditional Korean attire) I would plan to do it for more than two hours so you're not restricted especially if you like exploring and taking pictures.,263,hour
264,68,656,"The palace as with others in Korea does not have a lot of furniture or artefacts on display, however the palace its self and all the associated building as very interesting from an architectural viewpoint.  Lots of people walking around wearing Hanbok which adds to the atmosphere.  As other people have stated the secret gardens are not to be missed, very well laid out and when we were there last week the trees were in all their Autumn glory with vivid colours on display. (Not suitable for those with limited mobility).  It's a huge complex if you decide to see everything on site including the secret garden and easily takes around two to three hours to enjoy it all.  Would certainly recommend.",264,hour
265,69,661,"Changdeokgung Palace was the second royal villa built following the construction of Gyeongbukgung Palace in 1405. It was the principal palace for many kings of the Joseon Dynasty, and is the most well-preserved of the five remaining royal Joseon palaces. The palace grounds are comprised of a public palace area, a royal family residence building, and the rear garden.

They only have 100 spots for each tour and 50 are available for online reservation 6 days ahead at 10am. I went on the site and signed up at exactly 10am. Once I finished I looked back at the site and there were 0 remaining spots so they go quick! Once you arrive you have to show the reservation and actually buy the ticket. If you plan to visit Gyeongbokgung Palace as well, but the Integrated ticket instead and save 1000 or more. The tour is normally 90min long but they are doing a trial and allowing you to just walk on your own. Had I known this I wouldnt have bothered with the english tour and picked a better time. At my own pace I finished in about an hour.",266,hour

I got there not long after opening so was able to explore in peace and relative solitude...(before the tour groups)! While you can not enter any of the buildings, it is certainly worth a couple of hours visit. It is also easy to visit Changgyeonggung Palace as you can enter this site from the Changdeokgung Palace grounds.",270,hour

You get the option of adding on the garden tour here, which is a mandatory guided tour lasting 1.5 hours, but there is a lot to see even without the add on. The architecture is the exact same as the other palaces (I presume this even though we only visited Gyeonbokgung - but literally it was the same thing so I can only assume based on pictures that they are all pretty similar). There were some great photo ops here and I like being able to get up close to the buildings to really see the paintings and the structural elements that makes these palaces special.",271,hour
272,76,778,Beautiful palace in the central of Seoul.... peaceful...

273,77,780,"A really beautiful palace, it was a lot bigger than i expected. Took the free English tour, which was about an hour. The English tour runs more often than published on the webpage. Highly recommended to follow the tour so that you can get a proper history of the palace as the design of the rooms are about the same.  Go for the Huwon tour as well! The garden was really pretty.  Took about 1 hour each, be prepared to do a lot of walking as well as stair climbing.",273,hour

We can reach this location easily by subway - stop in Anguk Station, and just walk about 5 minutes, we must paid KRW 3000 to enter The Changdeokgung Palace, and if we want to enter The Secret Garden, we must add KRW 5000. Their provided a local tour guide, who will lead and give us an explanation for about 1.5 hours tour around The Secret Garden area, depend on we choose which language we want to hear the explanation (they have several choosing time - which different languages, as I know Chinese, Korean, and English).",274,hour

Plan your day to be in time for the English guided tour and start with this tour. It's about 1.30 to 2 hours. So keep yourself prepared for some walking. You can enter the place only with a guide!! There are bits that are surreal. Depending on the weather and time of the day views can be magnificent with reflections from lakes and ponds and the beautiful old Korean buildings. Not to forget the numerous plants and buildings. We just loved this garden.

281,85,824,"This is the 2nd palace i would recommend going to , besides Gyeongbokgung. This palace was the working palace for most of the Joseon dynasty and contains a lot of history and stories. When walking around please notice the number of layers of the stone foundation. Only royalty or important nobles could have 3 layers , others could only have 2 or less. pleas also notice the chimneys at the back of the buildings ( and not on top of the buildings). They provided underfloor heating from the earliest times. Here is a tip , try to join a free walking tour of the palace , it only takes 2 hours and its most entertaining. go to the visitkorea site to look for these tours. They are done by volunteers who dont want tips or payment. so bring some chocolates as gifts. but their knowlege is immense and they tend to be retirees who do this for a pastime.",281,hour

The palace is beautiful especially if you've never seen something similar. Within the palace grounds you also have the option of seeing the secret garden, however, this has to be guided and costs 5,000 Won, takes about an hour. Its not really a garden, more a forest that has hidden spots within it. Beautiful and worth the time.",282,hour
283,87,830,"I had a literal 24 hours in Seoul on a stopover and I was able to tour this beautiful palace with a local friend. The English tour was very informative and I learnt so much about what life would have been like at the palace throughout the ages! The architecture is gorgeous and the interior paintwork is like a mosaic of colour. I didn't have time to go into the secret garden, plus it was the middle of winter, but it was a lovely morning, well spent. They had a useful luggage storage locker facility, which was good as I was hauling at lot of gear.  I fully recommend visiting the palace if you are staying in Seoul, whether for a ridiculously short time like I was or for a longer time.",283,hour
284,88,844,"Changdeokgung Palace secret garden is a must visit! This requires a separate entry ticket, but well worth it. The garden is very well maintained and simply beautiful and very enjoyable for a leisurely walk. Join the guided tour for background information about each of the sites within the garden. Allow at least 2-3 hours so you can enjoy the palace leisurely. The palace (building) portion itself is nice, but the highlight is really the secret garden (rear garden). For those who are hoping to see the pond and bridge featured in the Korean Drama ""Rooftop Prince"" - sadly the drama is not filmed here. Nevertheless, the garden is still beautiful and worth a morning's visit!",284,hour

It's better to come early to the palace ground to beat the crowd! I didn't get time to enter the famous secret garden, but i believe it's beautiful. The palace ground itself is really beautiful. Showing the grand and elegance of the Jeoson dynasty. Some of the king's collections can be seen. Also, we can see interesting side of an actual weatern bed that the king used at the end of the japanese occupation in Korea.",288,hour
289,93,871,"The palace is one of the sights you need to see if you visit Seoul. It's historic and evocative, although the actual building interiors and surroundings are a bit austere and lifeless, as opposed to a more full-functioning actual monastery. The buildings themselves have been very nicely restored, however, and the grounds are impressive. Since the palace is right downtown it is easily accessible by subway, downtown hotels, etc.  Seeing only this sight/palace, as opposed to something more current and vibrant for the modern population would be a mistake, but if you have a few hours this is the kind of place that gives a sense for the history of Korea. It is also possible to rent traditional costumes nearby which can lend a novel flavor to your trip, and your photos, so long as you are willing to play the part and simultaneously feel a bit ridiculous.",289,hour
290,94,872,"So many things to say about the palace it definitely deserves a visit. I went on a Friday so I was able to buy the tickets including the pass for the Secret Garden on site .

The garden was so beautiful, words fail to describe its beauty, so here are some pictures.",290,hour

Reach the palace at least 20 mins before tour starts to secure booking. Went during Spring time, and trees look bare. Scenery would have been beautiful in Autumn. Secret Garden tour took around 1.5 hours to finish and there are up/down slopes to take on which might be tricky for elderly. It's still manageable to walk at your own pace, just that will be missing out on the introduction of the corners. Friendly tour guide are more than willing to share and answer queries which you might have for the sites.  Would love to be back during Autumn!",294,hour

And please wear comfartable clothes and shoes because you will be walking a LOT. Paying for the guided tour is important for you to learn a lot the local history. Take time to choose a quiet spot, sit down and observe Korea people who goes there. You would be amazed how much you can learn by observing the way they interact with each other, how they respect their culture and people. I was truly amazed!!!",300,hour
301,105,965,"Changdeok Palace is one of my favorite palaces out of the 4 main palaces in Seoul because it houses the Secret Garden. While all the other buildings and corners within the Changdeok Palace premises are pretty and worth seeing, I highly recommend that any new visitors also include a walk through the Secret Garden, which require joining a tour group and paying an entrance fee of KRW 5000 per adult. The tour takes about an hour and is provided in different languages. It's a good idea to check the schedule beforehand. It is fun to hear about the history related to each of the areas within the Palace. The different pavillions are also quite fascinating to see. Also, the Palace is known to have a different look in each season, each unique and each equally worth the visit. It is also conveniently situated near the Seoul central business district. Hope you enjoy!  서울 한복판에 잘 보존되어 있는 창덕궁은 정말 큰 보물인 것 같습니다. 계절마다 다른 아름다움이 있다고 합니다. 이번 크리스마스 직후 추운 날씨에 갔는데도 후원을 거닐면서 각기 다른 정자들을 보는 것이 큰 즐거움이였습니다.",301,hour
302,106,966,"Not as huge and ""sprawling"" (way to the back) as Gyeongbokgung and also not as ""brightly colorful"" with ceremonial guards & big guard ceremony as at Gyeongbokgung (saw no ceremonial guard whatsoever at the gate here), the ""highlight"" of this palace that sets it apart from all the other palaces is its so-called 'Secret Garden' (a.k.a. Huwon) all the way at the back which is actually a ""big park"" with grown trees, some ponds, beautiful small pavilions (& a pretty big pavilion on a high ground which is off-limits to the public) and an enclosed area with these traditional wooden row buildings forming a perimeter (guess it was like a royal resting place back in the day when they were in the garden, and also learned that the Joseon kings & queens actually took part in planting of trees & such activities, maybe as called for by the royal customs & tradition); I went in with the 12-pm Korean tour (missed my 11-am or 1130-am English tour) which took an hour & a half but it was such a ""well-timed & comfortable"" tour with only like a 10-minute walk at most between every two stops (about six stops in total) and places to sit down at each stop, so an hour & a half went by ""quite pleasantly"".  Another part of interest on the palace grounds is the residential area at the far end on one side (a left turn from the main pathway past the main palace building with the throne stage, or a right turn after coming out of the tour of the Secret Garden) where the last emperor of Korea & his wife after him spent their last years during the Japanese occupation. And a little ""out of the way"" from the rest of the Palace because it's on the other side of the main pathway from the rest of the Palace (a right turn from the main pathway just before getting to the Garden entrance, or a left turn after coming out of the Garden tour) is an enclosed area which was the place for the concubine of one of the Joseon kings.  Coming by subway, Anguk Station (on Line 3) is the nearest one with just a 5-to-10-minute walk east straight on the big Yulgok-ro St. to this palace. There's also the royal residence (not a palace) called Unhyeongung between the station and this palace (but you'll have to do a slight detour by turning right & walking a short distance to get there after coming out of the station). And right beside this palace is another palace called Changgyeonggung which you can actually ""very conveniently"" get to by going out the back exit (right beside the Secret Garden entrance) where you'll get to the high ground overlooking Changgyeonggung with stairs to go down to that palace.  As for the ticket, I suggest getting an ""integrated ticket"" for 10,000 won which is good for a month and which covers this palace and three other palaces namely the main palace Gyeongbokgung, Changgyeonggung (right beside here as mentioned above) & Deoksugung plus Jongmyo Shrine (also just in the vicinity of this palace); and do keep in mind that this palace along with Changgyeonggung & Deoksugung are closed on Mondays and Gyeongbokgung & Jongmyo Shrine are closed on Tuesdays.",302,hour

Be at the palace early to roam around and join the 10.30 General Tour (English) around the palace grounds. You will still make it for the 11.30am secret garden tour which takes 1.5 hours.  Following the tours make it so much easier to appreciate and understand the stories behind the buildings. You can either choose to get off Jongno 3 ga station (exit 6) or Anguk station (exit 3) depending on where you stay.

Great way to spend a couple hours.,308,hour

You can have a cup of traditional tea inside and I strongly recommend to have one.",309,hour
310,114,1083,"For me, visiting Seoul has been a lot of hustle and bustle. The Palace and Gardens were still very busy but visiting provided a but of respite from the crowds of Insadong.  Changdeokgung is one of four palaces (plus a shrine) in the area but is the only one that has a separate tour of the gardens. The secret garden area is by tour only (large groups-limited to 100 per tour) and they have different times with different languages. For entrance plus the garden tour it is 8000 won, but for only 10,000 won you can get a palace pass to visit the other 4 locations within 3 months of purchase. Definitely get the pass! The other four locations included are Gyeonbokgung palace, Changgyeonggung palace, Deoksung Palace and the Jongmyo Shrine.  My husband and I went on an afternoon English tour on a Saturday afternoon. The guide provided insight into how the royal family lived and used each of the buildings within the garden area and spoke english very clearly. The fall foliage makes it an excellent time to visit the gardens with a wide variety of trees changing. I believe the tour lasts about an hour and a half and does have steep hills to walk up.  Other than the garden tour, the palace is mostly just open space. The buildings themselves are beautiful and historically interesting, but there isn't a whole lot going on other than the buildings themselves. You will likely see many visitors dressed up in traditional Korean Hanbok taking photos within the palace. If you'd like, any places in the area rent these (I know I saw a few in the Insadong market)  My favorite thing about visiting the palaces is that they are literally right in the middle of the city. The city grew around the palaces so it is an interesting juxtaposition of the old and new. Definitely worth a visit- if you have to choose just one palace I'd pick Changdeokgung.  By Metro get off at Anguk Station and follow exit signs for ""Changdeokgung Palace"" When you exit, continue straight a few blocks and you'll walk right into it on your left.",310,hour

Even without the garden, it was a lovely place to stroll. We spend an hour or so, and it was enough time. Theres a small coffee shop/gift shop which is a great place to get a drink (we had ginger ice tea and loved it) and then sit inside or out and just enjoy this peaceful place.",317,hour
318,122,1115,"At 10am promptly every morning you can watch the Changing of the Guard ceremony. Colorful, and not too crowded, we thoroughly enjoyed the pomp and ceremony. Lots of youngsters wearing national costume to the event ( apparently you can rent them nearby for a couple of hours for a small fee and entry to the Palace will then be free), and lots of buses dropping off groups of school children. Well worth a visit.",318,hour
319,123,1117,Any one who's loves history. Specially the eastern history. They should come to this place I recommend it when weather is nice. There's a lot of walking the place is huge. So be carful. And make 6 hours to this amazing field.,319,hour
320,124,1118,It is a great place to just walk around like 1-2 hours was enough for me. Also you can go to the other palace next to it where the elder leaders residence was.,320,hour
321,125,1119,"This palace is open at night for certain period of the year. It used to be at the center of heavy and noisy traffic with a zoo. Now it is relatively quieter neighborhood. Without a zoo. One amazing development is all the walkways are accessible to wheelchairs. It opens at 7 at night. As it is less popular than another palace in downtown, it is less hubbub. You can enjoy a great walk feeling the spring air. No street vendors. Only some security guards as guiders. It was always there, you can find. I hope more spaces would be open and it would be connected to Secret Garden and Royal Family Garden. It would be then two-hour walk. As of now, it was about 30 minutes walk.",321,hour
322,126,1125,"Pros: UNESCO world heritage site, beautiful architecture and grounds, free tours in multiple languages Cons: Can be crowded (especially with school groups), historical perspective is missed without the tour guide explanations, lots of walking.  I visited the palace on an afternoon in October; the weather was perfect for a few hours outside. Although there were quite a few school groups there, I didn't have to wait to take the tours in English. I purchased the combined ticket (palace &a secret garden) for 8,000 won - a bargain in my opinion.  The architecture was really neat, from the designs and colors to the building sizes and concepts. The tour guides did a great job of explaining the little details that you might overlook; for example, I would never have guessed that the larger doorways were only for the emperor, while the smaller doorways were for the government officials and others - using those smaller doorways required the individuals to ""bow"" as the entered.  Personally, while I enjoyed the palace grounds, I liked the secret garden better; but this was due in part to the excellent tour guide and her details on how it was used by the emperors. The explanations and history changed the experience, bringing the buildings to life as one considers what it must have been like in the garden hundreds of years ago. I did note that the tour moves at a fairly set pace, and it is better if you focus on staying with the guide so you can see and hear her details - you can always walk back through areas at your own pace then the tour is over.",322,hour

However as we did not want a guided tour for 90 minutes we didn't pay for this. There is a Palace bundle for 10,000 won if you were looking to go to Gyeongbokgung and 2 other palaces. Entry is free for those in traditional Korean outfits and it was nice to see so many dressed in these outfits.  The Palace was rebuilt so it looks in good condition and modernish. It is a good place to while away an hour or two and get an idea of the history at a very cheap price.",326,hour

That is really beautiful and you can find the finest scenery of old korean building and nature together! they are harmonized! Plus, you can hear awesome explanation from special tour guide!

330,134,1169,"The real attraction of Changdeokgung is the Secret Garden. The palace itself was not as fascinating to us as Gyeongbokgung or Deoksugung which had costumed actors on site and changing of the guard pageantry. We visited Changdeokgung on a Sunday morning. No performers were in costume, although quite a few locals visiting were in colorful traditional Korean attire.  An English-speaking guide took us on a tour of the buildings which were interesting, but the Secret Garden tour was the real attraction. It's best to make reservations at least 24 hours in advance for the Secret Garden tour. We managed to see the palace grounds at 10:30am, followed immediately by the garden tour at 11:30am. The walled garden is beautifully landscaped with water features, trees, flowers, and Korean-style buildings and pagodas. The royal family spent their leisure time here, so every aspect of the garden is well-planned. The first 45 minutes of the walk is easy, the second half apparently ""more athletic"" we were told by the guide, so we decided to take it easy at go back at the halfway point.  Cost is 3,000 KRW for the palace and 5,000 KRW for the garden.",330,hour
331,135,1171,"You need to arrive fairly early if you want to do the secret garden tour after the palace tour. English-speaking guides take the tour around the palace at 10.30am and the secret garden tour kicks off at 11.30am. We turned up a bit late so although we had the palace tour, the garden tour was sold out and we had to wait until 1.30pm for that. Luckily our hotel was very near so we nipped back there as there isn't really another two hours of activity once you have toured the palace. The talk was very good at giving an insight into court life, meaning when we later went to Gyeongbokgung Palace we didn't feel it necessary to join a guided tour. Word of warning to the infirm, the garden tour has some quite steep climbs and quite a lot of older and more overweight vistors found the pace a bit intense, especially in the heat. It's also worth buying the four-palace pass if you intend to visit all the palaces in Seoul. We only did these two, but I'd recommend them both. Gyeongbokgung is much bigger and also contains two fantastic museums. A real must visit.",331,hour
332,136,1175,"I enjoyed visiting this gorgeous palace. It has so much architecture and history! The day we went was free entrance and we only had to pay for the English-guided garden tour which lasted an hour. When visiting you can see some Koreans dressed in traditional clothes. It can be very humid and hot so stay hydrated! Also, you can take beautiful pictures so I recommend bringing your best camera. Highly recommended if you are in the area!!!",332,hour
333,137,1177,"Changdeokgung Palace is set within a large park in Jongno-gu in Seoul. It is one of the “Five Grand Palaces” built by the kings during the Joseon Dynasty. And as such, it was the principal palace for many of the Joseon kings and a 600-year-old UNESCO World Heritage Site.  We were here for a visit as part of our full day city tour. We arrived at around 9.30am and stayed there for slightly over an hour. It was not crowded when we arrived (perhaps it was still early) and our admission fees had been included in our package tour. But I understand that the admission fee is 3,000 won per adult.  The palace ground was massive, with many ""interlinked"" palace buildings from one to another with a big open compound. Of course what was interesting was the ancient style of architectural design and to some extent, similar to the Chinese style. According to our guide, both ancient China and Korea were good allies and thus the country had some influences from the Chinese culture. (in fact, on the roof top of some buildings were designs of the Chinese classic novel, Journey to the West, with the Monkey God, the Tripitaka Master etc, cool!)  Maintenance and conservation work of the buildings had been done here by the city authorities. So we walked from one building to another, with some being able to enter or taking a look from outside on the interior structure of the palaces, such as the King's chair and office, paintings etc!  Along the way, we also saw some people wearing the traditional Korean Hanbok costumes, very nice, colourful and lovely~ And you are keen, you can try them out too!  As we need to visit several attractions in our tour, we were not able to stay to visit the Secret Gardens which according to our guide, was very beautiful and nice!  For us, the visit here was generally fine and interesting to learn about the ancient culture of Korea though we would love to see more like in Gyeongbukgung Palace. Weather was very sunny and warm and do remember to bring along an umbrella, hat and drinking water.  Well, if you are planning to visit some palaces in your trip here, Changdeokgung Palace is also a good option besides the Gyeongbukgung, though the latter has much more to see, besides the buildings and gardens, bigger, there is also an ancient ""change of guard"" ceremony.  But do take note that the former is closed on Mondays and the latter is closed on Tuesdays!",333,hour
334,138,1184,"I went there after visiting the Gyeongbokgung palace and for me they look very similar. I can't even distinguish my pictures being taken in both palaces. Maybe the secret garden would have been more interesting, but the ticket for the garden was a little bit too expensive. I was really bored walking around this palace and took about 10 pictures. I think i needed less than 1 hour. If you have already seen one palace, you can skip this one. The same thing i had to criticize about the Gyeongbokgung: You can never enter the rooms or make a good picture from the intererior.",334,hour

338,142,1193,A couple of hours tops is what you should spend here. They have a lovely garden and the changing of the guard is good to see.,338,hour
339,143,1196,"we went at around 930 am and were hustled into the inner yard. there was the ceremonial precession right behind us. The whole thing takes about an hour and they ask you to stay so you don't interrupt, but you can leave. we stayed for about 30 minutes and it was a neat opportunity to see a historic offering take place.",339,hour
340,144,1220,"A friend and I took the Secret Garden Tour (1.5 hour tour) and it provided a satisfactory perspective of Korea's history - from its early beginnings to today.  Our guide spoke very easy-to-understand English and used an amplifier so that everyone could hear her. I was amazed to see her wearing a traditional hanbok in the heat and humidity!  The gardens are very beautiful, feature several water fixtures, and wind through a seemingly endless supply of architecturally beautiful pavilions. It does not feel like you are in the middle of a busy city with all the green trees providing shade overhead.  With that said, the tour can still be a little tiring. There are numerous hills and you will walk a fair distance. I would recommend bringing water and insect repellent. There is a cafe at the entrance to the palace and a souvenir shop near the large pond in the Secret Garden Tour. You will find different souvenirs at each so if you see something you like, buy it, as it may not be at the other shops. I purchased a collection of Korean stamps!  There were some neat looking trees on the property - one that is believed to be at least 700 years old! There were lots of photo opportunities and the tour guide was good a maintaining a good pace - not too rushed!  Recommend if you want to see a palace.",340,hour
341,145,1223,"There are several palaces of this type in Seoul. If you are expecting a palace in the European sense you will be disappointed.

The palace itself is cozy and not exhausting, interesting to see the layout, but the secret garden is the major attraction here, so please make sure you visit it! It's spread on a relatively wide surface but the alleys are very pleasant and it conveys peace and calm, it's a definite must. You hand to join a tour in order to be able to enter, at specific hours, and it takes about 1.5h but it's totally worth it and the guide was very gifted to transport us in the mood and the stories of the time.",343,hour
344,148,1251,An occupied palace fir over 600 years with amazing grounds. The maintenance must be huge but this place is kept in good condition despite the small admission fee. The English secret garden tour at 130pm was great. It's up and over a couple of hills but you see some tranquil and beautiful sights on this tour. Allow a good couple of hours to do it justice.,344,hour
345,149,1256,"I went in July which was very warm and humid so if you are going at this time make sure you have plenty of water and sun protection. The visit would have been nicer if the weather was cooler. The entrance fee is 3000 but I would advise you to get the Secret Garden tour which includes the entrance fee at 8000. For a 1.5 hour tour they bring you further inside and you get to see more. The palace is peaceful and beautiful but I was a little underwhelmed. Asked a friend who went to Gyeongbokgung palace, she says it is grander than this palace so wished I gone to that one instead.",345,hour
346,150,1257,We visited Changdeokgung Palace after a visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace in the morning. They are very different and unique in their own way. I personally prefer the Changedeokgung more due to the Secret Garden. You can only visit the secret garden by joining the guided tour. I would recommend that you book the ticket via its website in advance to avoid disappointment. It's an hour and a half tour and it's a pity that one is not allowed to stay and explore more after the tour.,346,hour

348,152,1262,"My fiancée and I visited this palace on a Sunday afternoon.  The sheer size of the palace is quite impressive and it is well worth the 3 000 won entrance fee. We also wanted to experience the secret garden, however access to the garden is restricted to guided tours only, and the tour time table did not fit with our time schedule.  Opening hours (palace & secret garden) is from 09:00. Closing time varies between 16:30 to 18:00 depending on the time of year. Closed on Mondays.  Guided tours (in English) to the secret garden is at: 11:30 13:30 14:30 15:30 English speaking guided tours are offered only between February and October.  Guided tours in English to the palace area are at 10:30 and 14:30 only.  Fees for the palace area is 3000 / 1500 won for adults / children, while fees for the secret garden (palace area included) are 8000 / 4000 won for adults / children. Seniors (over 65 years of age) pay 5000 won.  My fiancée and I found our visit to be a rewarding experience and we would not hesitate recommending it as an attraction.",348,hour

353,157,1299,Nice place to check out probably can do this in an hour and just check out the main palace without walking around everywhere as it gets a bit boring after an hr. I missed the changing of the guard if you can when the change guards will be a better experience,353,hour
354,158,1305,"The strange history concerning how many times it has been destroyed and rebuilt (portions at least) is fascinating. And from far it looks small but as you approach you see the intricate details and great attention that was laid to each element that makes it so beautiful. There were lots of people, but I found that charming. It was good to have a tour guide to tell us about the nuances of the structures and the layout and some of the stories that make a place so much richer. Not good to go on a rainy day. Worth a visit if you have the time - about 1:30-2 hours is good enough. Then it becomes a bit repetitive. If you get a chance walk around the area in the city because there is lots to do there as well, not just sightseeing.",354,hour
355,159,1312,Our annual Rotary International convention was held in Seoul Korea this year. We took a few extra days for sightseeing. This Palace was one of the highlights for me. I love history and I love beautiful things. This inexpensive tour combines both of those. I love the way it Korean culture honors its history. This is a beautiful place to visit without spending too many dollars. You can do the whole thing in an hour or two. I also very much enjoyed the museum adjacent to the Palace. Air-conditioned and a nice restaurant inside it was a good diversion in the middle of a hot day. If you can do this with the tour guide it is even better. Too many things that you simply would not understand without having a guide.,355,hour
356,160,1313,"A small palace where you can spend one or two hours.  They also have changing guard with two shows a day, check their new schedule first, otherwise you will miss it..  At the entrance, look for some young ladies who are wearing a yellow t-shirts. They are students from the local school and they volunteer to be tour guide. This service is free and they are a bunch of friendly and helpful people. Perhaps this is part of their history, so most of them are very knowledgeable with all part of the palace and can walk through each part with you. They are very proficient with English and some times can be humor too.  After the tour, it is optional to complete a survey for them and they will bring back to their school.  This palace is comparatively small with the Grand Palace, but each section has its own functionality. The secret garden is very beautiful.  We are lucky to enter for free because that week was their Golden Week, otherwise, you have to pay Won3000 per person, but the cost is worth for it.",356,hour

Visit the secret garden,it is well worth it. Tour takes an hour and a half. No food allowed but you can buy water half way round. It is a bit hilly but worth the trek. Make sure you leave enough time for your first tour and the secret garden. You reserve as specific time for the secret garden.

I am so glad I did, as the gardens were truly beautiful. The gardens can only be viewed by taking part in the guided tour. It was conducted by a quide who's english was clear and easy to understand. She was quite humourous and informative throughout.  The only thing I would say is that the tour lasts for 1.5hours and involves some inclines, so comfortable walking shoes are a must. Definitely worth a visit.",364,hour
365,169,1384,"We had visited the Geongbokgung Palace the last visit and thought we needed to view the Secret Garden and naturally visit Changdeokgung Palace. The palace is rather small and the highlight would the garden.For this you have to go on the website and make a booking. We chose to go on Christmas Day thinking it would be quiet but our group was large, at least 30 (sure reminds of my school trips!). Give yourself half an hour to visit the actual palace itself. I loved the garden as it was huge, sitting in an area much bigger than the palace. It was a hunting ground for the king in the olden days so as to give you an idea how large it was. It is an oasis of calm in the midst of Seoul! However, you can only visit with a guide and therefore cannot enjoy it as much as it should be. I love to sit and watch the world go by so that is not possible. Lovely and well worth a visit.",365,hour

However, it is also right next door to Changgyeonggung Palace too, with an adjoining entry, so you might squeeze that one in too. We bought a combined ticket, which covered all four Palaces, the secret garden, and Jongmyo Shrine, and saved us money. Be sure you check opening hours - the Palaces and Shrine are not open every day. The Palace at Changdeokgung - you can walk around that by yourself, or go on a guided tour (do some research, as this doesn't apply year-round). It has toilets and a café, and pretty gardens without having to go into the secret gardens. When we were there (the last week of March, 2016), the blossoms were just starting to come out on the trees - in one or two weeks time, it would have been sensational! As regards the secret gardens, a tour needs to be booked (and they do it in Korean, Japanese, Chinese or English at various times of the day). We arrived about half an hour before the first English tour (11:30am), and it was already fully booked, so immediately booked the next one at 1:30pm. Note: there are good coffee and food shops in the vicinity!). So you can't go into the secret garden without a guide. The guide stops in about 4 places, explains them, and then gives you about 10 minutes to wander around by yourself. The ""secret"" aspect to ""the secret garden"" is that only the King and his mates could enter them. There's some pretty pagodas and other buildings for resting, eating and cooking (King's gotta eat!), water features, and gardens. And also a couple of relatively steep slopes in case you were wondering. All very pretty.",373,hour

When you're done with the palace, head right next door to Bukchon Hanok for lunch. Note that this palace is closed on Mondays.",374,hour

377,181,1455,"To enjoy this marvelous palace, I recommend a guided tour which not only adds to the enjoyment but also provides many hidden stories of this palace and how it all ties to the history of Korea. Even without the tour guide, the ground is gorgeous and you can get lost several hours in there. If I were to choose one royal palace to visit in Seoul, this would be the one.",377,hour
378,182,1456,"When I arrived at the site there was an hour left till the 1:30pm English tour. So to avoid the possible crowd I started to checkout the place and take photos. The size of palace is miniature compare to all others, which makes this one ideal as an 'introduction' or 'summary' of korea's nearest historical governance.  My tour guide, Tian, knows the history well and is able to answer my questions about the palace, Korean history, and the emperor family. She was able to condense the tour to 30min for me to witness the guard exchange presentation at the gate by 2pm.  Yes I recommend this place.",378,hour
379,183,1463,"Had a few hours to kill so I went to the Changdeokgung Palace to walk around. Went on the garden tour which was muddy and not very interesting. The walking areas are sandy dirt, so plan accordingly as your shoes will be a mess when you leave. It had rained/snowed a few days before my visit and the grounds were not in great shape. Worth going, but probably much nicer in spring and summer. I would not pay extra for the garden tour in the winter as there is not much to see.",379,hour

383,187,1493,"We enjoyed our time there but it was a very long day. They only have three English tours per day of the Secret Garden area. You're only allowed to see those 75 acres during a tour. If you are not physically fit, this part may not be the place for you. It involves lots of walking, most up hills or stairs. It was 90 minutes long and we had to wait 3 hours before the tour began (we walked around the ""castle"" and its surrounding buildings. It was interesting if you're a history buff like my husband. I definitely don't recommend it with children.",383,hour

385,189,1523,"Plan a few hours in here, the grounds are huge, and there are many nooks and crannies to visit. Best if you bring a guidebook that tells the story of what each section represents. From grandiose main palaces to servant quarters, take your time to soak in the history and beauty of the ancient times and gardens",385,hour
386,190,1549,"Our guide was apparently a fan of PSY, which we found to be hilarious. Anyway, the narrow passages of this palace were very interesting to walk through, although the palace itself is not that different from the rest. Huwon (Secret Garden) is probably a lot more beautiful in spring/summer, but it was still nice to walk through. While the free guided tours are a great way to encourage tourists to learn about Korean history, I do think that the guided tour of the garden is too long. One hour is more than enough to cover this part of the attraction (it takes 90 minutes), especially considering the fact that joining a guided tour is the only way one can see the garden.",386,hour
387,191,1550,"A beautiful palace full of history and stories. We had an english speaking guide who told us the history of the palace and I have a personal guide with me who told me the love story of the king and prince, etc. The palace was partially destroyed but restored later hence some of the heritage is quite modernized. But there more of the palace that are still original and you can still appreciate the beauty of the buliding and the creativity of the craftmens. Somehow it didn't give me the sense of labor intensity when I walked around the palace unlike the Summer Palace in Beijing. I enjoyed walking around the palace...and it's worth the 2-3 hours spend there.",387,hour

389,193,1566,"Changdeokgung Palace (￦3,000 per adult) is one of the Five Royal Palaces built during the Joseon Dynasty and another important UNESCO World Heritage attraction you can visit in Seoul. Opening hours are 9am until 6 or 6.30pm depending on the season, closed on Mondays.  Note: There is a rear Secret Garden which you can also visit by purchasing the combined ticket (￦10,000 per adult).  Changdeokgung Palace was the primary place of residency for many of the Joseon kings during the 16th and 17th centuries. Here you can find similar buildings, pavilions and landscaping to that Gyeongbukgung Palace. In fact, Changdeokgung is often referred to as East Palace while Gyongbukgung took on the reference of West Palace.  A major difference between the Gyeongbukgung and Changdeokgung palace grounds are that while the former is laid out on centre axis, Changdeokgung is built around the typography of the land, which provides a more natural and harmonious feel to the various buildings and structures you can browse here.  Changdeokgung Palace itself is smaller in scale than Gyeongbukgung and if you don't visit the Secret Garden as well, you can easily and comfortably explore the grounds here in 60-90 minutes. As such, this might be a preferred UNESCO attraction if you are limited in time during visits to Seoul. If time permits, we suggest visiting both the East and West Palaces so you can consider and think about the similarities and differences between them.",389,hour
390,194,1571,Make sure you book tickets for the Secret Garden tour well in advance (at least 2 weeks) - the tour is fantastic and you will not want to miss out. We could have spent hours poking around the grounds. It is beautiful and charming. Easily accessible by transit (Anguk Station is a 5 minute walk from the ticket office). Make time on your trip for Changdeokgung.,390,hour
391,195,1584,"This is one of the more popular and possibly the largest among the 5 grand palaces of Seoul. The station nearest to it is Anguk which is a short walking distance. We were lucky because the hanok where we stayed is just a stones throw away. If you are a first time visitor, has enough time, and want to see all 5 grand palaces, then I suggest you get the all-inclusive ticket for KRW10,000 (USD8.80). This will save you a few extra bucks instead of paying an entrance fee for each palace. One of its main features is the secret garden which is quite beautiful especially during autumn! My host said it's better during winter but I digress. Tourist guides are a must and schedules are organized depending on which language you prefer. The tour takes about an hour 45 so best to wear your most comfy shoes. If you're lucky enough, try to go with a smaller group as bigger ones tend to be harder to manage plus pictures look best with less crowds.",391,hour
392,196,1585,The Palace is historical and quietly beautiful. The Secret Garden can only be accessed through the guided tours. 1 1/2 hours to cover the grounds. If you don't mind traveling sometimes in a very large group (English tour on a beautiful fall day numbered over 100 people) you'll have a pleasant time.,392,hour
393,197,1586,I walked to Changdeokgung Palace in early afternoon from the Gyeongbokgung Palace and Bukchon Village. The palace is enormous and requires at least a couple of hours of exploration. I suggest that you book a guided tour as the signage and written history is scarce. The Secret Garden is a must!! Absolutely beautiful and a lot less crowded than the palace itself. Be sure to buy your tickets upon entering the palace for access to the garden. A walk through the garden is something I'll never forget. I suggest you take a favourite book and take in some reading in the old outdoor library located there. There are books avail for reading on loan also.,393,hour
394,198,1591,"Visited this palace after sightseeing at Insadong. We comfortably walked to the palace from Insadong craft and teahouse district in 15 minutes. We enjoyed the beauty of the palace and it's surrounds. Unfortunately we did not get to enter the secret garden as we arrived 1 hour before closing time, so please ensure if you are wanting to see the place and secret garden you allow yourself at least 3 hours. Enjoy.",394,hour
395,199,1598,"The secret garden makes up 60% of the palace grounds and is absolutely breath-taking, especially with the autumn foliage. Places were limited to 100 a day (50 online, 50 on the day itself), and I could not book the tickets online even though it was a week away from our planned visit. Instead, we planned to reach the palace at 8.30 a.m. (opening time is 9.00 a.m.) to purchase the tickets. We were lucky we did, as we managed to talk beautiful shots of the palace grounds once the gates were opened, and before the hordes of tourists swarmed in. By 10 a.m. it was difficult to take pictures without tourist photo bombers.  We joined the English guided tour at 10.30 a.m. which lasted for an hour and then the Secret Garden tour at 11.30 a.m. Both tour guides were very knowledgeable and we enjoyed their explanations. However, the secret garden tour was very crowded and there were definitely more than 100 people there. They might have made an exception due to a conference tour group that joined the tour. Also, people were not really interested in the tour guide, instead choosing to wander off and take pictures. Couldn't really blame them when the landscape was so beautiful.  We really enjoyed the 3-4 hours we spent here! Worth a visit! It is located about 10 minutes walk from Anguk station. After the palace, we visited the Hanok Village, Samcheongdil (Korea's café hub) and Insadong for souveniers. Good area to spend a day and tick off Seoul's major attractions.",395,hour
396,200,1608,Went to 2 palace while in Seoul. This is my fav of the 2 because of the secret garden. It's a must go if you are visiting this palace. Some walking up hill and slope is needed along the secret garden path so proper shoes are needed. Do note you need advance booking and a seperate ticket to the secret garden which can only be done by tour at specific time.  There are total of 3 tickets needed to access the entire palace which comes in a combination ticket.  Allow 3-4 hours for a slow leisure walk to enjoy this beautiful from the past.,396,hour
397,201,1611,"Similar to Gyeonbukgong...but this property has The Secret Garden. It has an extra charge for admission. Guided tour is only at certain times(s) of the day. WEAR COMFY SHOES or SNEAKERS. There are MANY places that are uneven, unpaved, MANY STEEP STAIRS with no rails, etc. If you have mobility issues, I would not recommend. Tour is about 1 1/2 hours.  Especially lovely in autumn or spring, when the leaves change or the shrubs/trees/flowers bloom. Very relaxing place.",397,hour
398,202,1629,"Seoul has several impressive royal palaces. They are spread around the city generally on the north side of the river which dissects the city. Changdeokgung Palace is reasonably small and intimate with a rabbit warren layout of rooms, courtyards and small gardens. It is one of the ""Five Grand Palaces' built during the Joseon dynasty. While it was originally created as a primary palace in 1395 it was heavily destroyed during the 20th century Japanese occupation and has been rebuilt. The most famous imperial Secret Garden is quite special and needs a separate ticket to enjoy its flowers and layout.

The Palace has is beautifully restored, and provides a good insight into what historical Seoul would have been like. It would be great to actually be able to get inside some of the buildings or to have some set up with period furniture to even further fill in the context. Regardless, it's a lovely place to walk around.",399,hour
400,204,1636,"Check for the guided tour timings before going, if not you may waste your time. The tour takes one hour. Not the biggest, but nicely preserved complex, linked to a great story, history. Should you wish to visit the secret garden, you have to book in advance, on their website. Also a guided tour, around 100 people, walking up and down in the forest for 90 minutes. A few nice stops, however quite tiring. Avoid going on a rainy day, as it is very slippery.",400,hour
401,205,1646,"The beauty of this palace lies mostly in its Secret Garden which is only accessible by joining the tour. You can reserve slots for the tour online & just show the confirmation to the staff when buying the tickets at least half an hour before the tour. The tour was informative but I was so captivated by the beauty of the Secret Garden. The palace pales in comparison so please sign up for the tour if possible, at additional 5,000 won, on top of the admission fee of 3,000 won.",401,hour
402,206,1647,"The Changdeokgung Palace is a must see - it is a very large compound so be prepared to walk, and their are no tours and very limited information on each of the different spots within the Palace so you may want to do some reading before hand.  The Secret Garden in the back is breath-taking, but be prepared it is a 1.5 to 2 hour walk which must be with a tour guide. It is a massive compound and lots of up and down hill so make sure you have the right shoes as some paths are not paved.  If you plan to visit the secret garden i suggest going early or on a weekday as the tour i took was very crowded about 100 people with only 1 guide so you won't really hear what he has to say or get any alone time with nature since there are so many people in the group all taking photos.",402,hour
403,207,1650,"Visited here as part of a multi palace wander of Seoul. This beautiful and serene spot contains ancient Korean palace architecture, well manicured grounds, aquaducts, and much more. You can see the place in under an hour if you hustle, but I would suggest spending a few hours to take in the many great views. This is a coll piece of Korean history and culture which must have been truly spectaculat in the day",403,hour
404,208,1653,"The palace complex consists of several buildings, each with its own unique story and design. It is well worth a wander around and if you time your visit right and take a tour then the history is intriguing but good signposting in English and Korean mean you can learn something about the place guided or not. Each of the palaces of Seoul has its own character and this one for me is the most interesting. A great place to spend an hour wandering around.",404,hour
405,209,1656,It is very near to Gyeongbokgung. Visit the Secret Garden. It takes 2 hours. The tour guide will tell you stories about building in it.,405,hour
406,210,1668,"Let me start by advising that the ""pay extra and have the ability to tour independently on Thursdays"" that you may find in the latest editions of guidebooks is dated and incorrect. They discontinued that some time back. You may still tour the grounds of the Palace without a guide but the Secret Garden is by 1 1/2 hr guided tour only.  To fully absorb the entire complex (ie Changdeokgung, the Secret Garden, Changgyeonggung and Jongmyo) properly allow a full sightseeing day, unless you visit during the summer when it will stay light until evening.  Although they are usually lumped together, since they require separate entrance fees, I will address them separately. This is solely for Changdeokgung.  Like its competitor to the west, this palace is on a huge, sprawling piece of land. Architecturally, it best reflects the Joseon Dynasty's sensibilities. It is set amid, not on top of, its surroundings and landscaping. It does not seek to overwhelm (as does Gyeongbokgung) but rather to consistently impress and inspire awe. Take the 1 hour guided tour if you'd like, but then return, history in hand, and wander through its labyrinthine design.  As you move from west to east (assuming you use the entrance off of Yulongno, passing through Donghwamun Gate), you will eventually come upon the King and Queen’s private quarters. Finally, there is the residence of the Crown Prince (farthest to the east as he is a symbol of the rising sun).  The structures and grounds are very well maintained and there is a café across the way where you can cool off and relax before taking the Secret Garden tour next door. You might want to get the garden tour times in advance and time your visit to the palace accordingly.  Keep in mind that if you continue on to Changgyeonggung, when the grounds close, the path back to Changdeokgung closes and your only way out will be the gate to the extreme east... which is, logistically, in the middle of nowhere.",406,hour
407,211,1672,"The palace is old and seeped in history. There are english guided tours that lasts an hour. They take you through some of the important aspects of the history. So well worth that. It is very well maintained and even the restroom facilities are quite zen like. So, do visit. When you buy tickets for the palace, do buy the tickets for the Secret Garden tour as well. The English tour of the palace ends 10 minutes before the guided Secret Garden tour. Only 100 tickets are available to the secret garden per tour. It can be crowded, but you can enjoy the flora. There are some very old trees, including a 750 year old one.",407,hour
408,212,1682,When I went there I was so lucky because it was nearly empty because I visited like one hour before it's closure but still had time to take a lot of photos and visit all. It closes at around 5pm i think so go there at 3:30 so it won't be crowded!,408,hour

As such, you will be able to have a better understanding of how life in the palace is like. Of cos, having a secret garden tour adds to mystic of the place.  Tip: take the complimentary tour of palace if you have an hour to spare. (together with the 90mins secret garden tour, you will need about 3hrs here) The guides are very professional and communicate very well in english. The insights offered by them will definitely make your visit more memorable.",411,hour

This is recommended if you like to focus on the interesting history talks of the tour guide wearing Traditional Korean Hanbok while showing you around the palace. It will take an hour till your next tour to the Secret Garden. That's why you don't have time to take much photos because there's a lot of places you will be visiting with the group (in fast pace) then next going uphill to the garden. You must wear running shoes, enough sunblock, insect repellent, water and eye shades as you are going to do some hiking. We visited the area during summer (June 2015). The tour in the secret garden and the admission fee are separate purchase at the ticket booth.

However, the sites are beautifully preserved and maintained, showing many special pavilions in the midst of greenery and waters. The tour will last for 1 half hour.

426,230,1827,"In the middle of Seoul, There is a place you must visit. It is a Changdeokgung Secret Garden. It is definitely an unmissable place when you come to Korea. There are three reasons why you should put the Secret garden on your tour list.  First, it is a historically meaningful place. It has been about 600 years since Changdeokgung Palace was constructed in 1405. At first it was built for the purpose of second royal villa, but then Changdeokgung Palace had become a primary royal residential palace for the longest time as many Joseon Dynasty kings loved this place. The Secret Garden was especially a haven for the kings because it was a very private space where the kings could evade the strict court’s life. They usually spent their spare time reading, fishing and strolling there. While walking through the garden, you can imagine what it would be like to be a Joseon king.  Secondly, it is an eye-pleasing place. The garden was kept as natural as possible. The buildings were designed to make a good harmony with the surroundings, so all the trees, hillsides, streams and rocks are integral parts of the garden. The garden is filled with various kinds of plants and trees. There are more than hundred different kinds, and some are over 400 years old. Therefore, you might feel like you are in the middle of an arboretum. It’s a magical place just to look at as the structures blend perfectly into the nature.  Lastly, it is a perfect place for tourists. Special tour programs are held every spring and they offer English, Chinese and Japanese guided tours. The tour takes about an hour and gives you an explanation of the historical significance of the constructions. Besides, Changdeokgung Secret Garden has a great location where people can easily come by public transportation. Also, Insadong (where you can enjoy lots of Korean traditional crafts, street foods and art galleries) and Gyeongbokgung (where is another gorgeous palace of Joseon Dynasty) are both within walking distance from Chandeokgung. Therefore, tourists can find various attractions and it’s easy for them to make touring plans.  As shown above, the Secret Garden is worth visiting. If you are making plans to visit Seoul, I suggest you visit Changdeokgung Secret Garden. One thing to remember is, if you want a guide tour, you should book it before the visit. You can make a reservation at the Chandeokgung website: http://eng.cdg.go.kr/main/main.htm. Don’t forget to book and enjoy the tour.",426,hour

It was one pavilion after another (after a while, every pavilion looks the same and barely excites).  We went on the English tours of the palace and the secret garden, and it took us 2.5 hours. What was nice is that it managed to take us back in time to the chosun period. But i would recommend it only if you have visited the main palace and wants to see more.",427,hour

430,234,1833,"In case you are a business traveller, and have very little time to see through the rich Korean history in Seoul, this place (Changdoekgung) along with the other one in heart of city (Gyeongbukgung) would be an ideal place for an afternoon short trip - it's well possible to squeeze any of these palaces between your morning meetings and evening drinking sessions...  Changdeokgung is the only UNESCO World Heritage site out of the Five Grand Palaces built by Joseon dynasty which ruled Korea. Magnificent piece of authentic ancient Korean architecture.  There are many tour operators who offers a package of Changdoekgung with night markets etc., but you will need to enquire first whether they will take you into the 'Secret Garden'... you SHOULD NOT miss it. I booked with an operator, and upon learning that they will only provide entry to the palace and not the 'Secret Garden', I decided to abandon the tour midway and be on my own.  The palace and 'Secret Garden' tickets are sold separately, and 'Secret Garden' is opened to a batch of tourists with a Palace guide guiding you on the trail once every 15-30 mins. So, you may have to get in there, and plan for a secret garden ticket with a slot an hour at least from when you reach (sometimes there is quite a rush, and number of tickets per slot is limited to a maximum 30 ish). I spent the hour seeing the palace, and then went for the Secret Garden tour, which is technically 70% of the palace area.  It was worth a wait. Lush-green tree-rows with beautifully crafted lake-houses .... the flora was just amazing. ... I wonder if I liked the whole trail so much in summer, how good it will be during the spring season..  The only flip-side which I will regret - taking a Korean tour of 'Secret Garden' [every slot of Secret Garden tour is in a specific language and only few were in English] since the next English tour available was still couple of hours more of wait. so couldn't make much out of the context. But hey.. you always have a Wikipedia, it's the visual and other sensory experiences that matter...",430,hour
431,235,1843,"This palace is definitely the best of all palaces in Seoul. You can easily spend there three hours, especially if you take Secret Garden excursion. There are many buildings belonging to the palace complex, and thus, many narrow backstreets that you can wander around. Secret Garden is beautiful place indeed. Water, pavillions, occasional racoons :) The only problem with excursion was the guide herself. Her tone of speaking was kinda arrogant and snobish. May be it is just lost in translation problem. The route and stops are tightly scheduled, up to minute. So we were commanded all the time where to go, when to go, when to stop. It felt like we are back to school with teacher. However, you have time to catch the spirit of the place and make enough of photos. I definitely recommend to visit this palace, especially if you have limited time.",431,hour
432,236,1845,"You have to go, one of the best things we did in our trip to the area. We liked the old park area also. A few hours is enough and best towards the start of end of the day, when more locals to take photos off. Tommy",432,hour
433,237,1846,The palace was nice to see. The entrance of the palace and the secret garden includes a free tour also in english. The palace was big and both tour took around 3 hours. Maybe we are not a fan of history but wanted to see one palace but it was not that spectacular.,433,hour
434,238,1856,if you go in the morning early you can see the parade they do showing tourists how was long time ago...that was very nice and i even record an almost half hour video....very interesting,434,hour
435,239,1860,This palace is very close to downtown core of Seoul and very close to the subway station. It looks like an oasis in the middle of a vibrant city. The elegance of the design is fantastic. An architectural wonder from my point of view. The paintings and carvings are stunning. If you can catch the time where the soldiers in traditional clothes take part in a ritual; it will be a great experience and also a great attraction for kids. The size of the drums is incredible by the way. A 2 hour trip will be enough to enjoy this palace and it is pretty cheap.,435,hour
436,240,1877,Absolutely awesome. I recommend the Secret Garden Tour. The tour lasts about 1.5 hours and costs an extra 5000won.... but totally worth it,436,hour
437,241,1878,"I was very lucky to have joined a Moonlight Tour at Changdeokgung Palace organized by Korea Cultural Heritage Foundation, Ministry of Culture, Sports, Tourism and Cultural Heritage Administration on May 4th 2015. Visiting these beautiful palaces in Seoul, during the day is a completely different experience when visiting them at night. I had a surreal, wonderful time during 2-hour tour; walking around Changdeokgung Palace and in the Secret Garden; with the full moon that night, it felt like we were in another era. The traditional dance, gayageum and pansori performances gave me goosebumps; and that tour was the best part of my visit to Seoul. :)",437,hour
438,242,1896,"Personally, I would choose this Palace over the other palaces. It is the UNESCO one and it was more balanced and beautiful. I am not sure if the ""Secret Garden"" tour was worth it. It is a lot of walking, FYI and takes 1 hour or so.",438,hour

440,244,1898,I wish we would have allotted more time to explore. I believe were there for about an hour and we didn't have time to fully explore. The time of the day were there (or the day of the week--not sure) the secret garden was not open for viewing. It was a truly beautiful place with a lot of interesting nooks to go into.,440,hour
441,245,1909,"I visited the Palace for the second time in a year and I liked the atmosphere of imperial Korea and the surrounding gardens (fully developed in August, blossoming in April). Make sure you have at least 2-3 hours to spend there!",441,hour
442,246,1911,"Spent a morning here, ticket price of 3000 includes free guided tour. The English one runs at 10.30am, once that finishes if you have purchased the Secret Garden ticket (5000) you can join the 11.30am tour for that.  The tour through the main palace was informative and a good overview in about 50mins. Would recommend it to get a good understanding of the architecture and history. Yes it is no where on the same scale as Forbidden City but I found it enjoyable all the same.  The Secret Garden is beautiful and visiting in spring time with the blossoms out is really magical. The tour is 1.5hours and does feel very rushed. You have to stay with the guide all the time and on the 5 stops during the tour you have between 5-10mins to look around by yourself. The group size was about 100 people. Walking through the forest is wonderful and this part is definitely the highlight of the Palace visit.",442,hour
443,247,1923,"I wandered around this beautiful complex with free admission, because I had turned up on the last Wednesday of the month (great tip if you are in the city at this time!). It is easy to spend a couple of hours here, exploring the buildings and grounds. You can also take a tour of the Secret Garden - this has to be a tour and there are limited tickets, so be sure to get there early for a tour in your language. Well worth the extra fee though - so tranquil.",443,hour

445,249,1936,Loved this place and my only regret is that my family and myself only spent less than 3 hours here. Amazed that the buildings and surrounding facilities are well-kept and maintained. The guide is also knowledgeable and was able to give us an interesting history of how the royals once lived on this marvelous compound.,445,hour
446,250,1940,"We visited this Palace on a free tour out of the Incheon Aiport. It was part of the Seoul Culture Tour - a free 5 hour tour (10 am to 3 pm) provided by the airport for passengers on long layovers. It was very cold - 10 Celsius, and the Airport even provided free down parkas. The Palace is well preserved. It was educational and picturesque. We learned a lot about Korean history and culture and very much enjoyed this introduction Korea. Per our guide the best time to visit South Korea is March and April. Winter is cold and summer is hot and muggy.",446,hour
447,251,1942,"We only wanted to visit one palace as we had two kids with us. This one was recommended in all travel books as the one you have to see. We went early morning and just missed the crowd who came after 11am. You can buy a ticket for the palace grounds only to walk around on your own or join two of the free english tours (the first one is at 10:30am, the second one I think in the early afternoon). They also sell a combined ticket palace and secret garden, but the garden is only available with a tour (english 10:30, 90 min). The palace is well maintained, houses look nice and colourful. The ticket price is not too bad for a nice walk through and we spend around 1 hour there. I missed some more signage and explanations about the different kind of buildings. There is only an introduction at the entrance. So make sure you read a little bit in advance. And I would have loved to see more interior. Apart from that it was a nice visit.",447,hour
448,252,1947,It was a very informative tour given by the local guide. We also saw a great performance by the palace guards. Overall it was a great way to spend a few hours learning about there culture.,448,hour
449,253,1949,I decided to visit the palace as I had never seen something like this before. There was a relatively cheap entrance fee and there were not many people so the trip was very slow paced and relaxing. The grounds are quite large so give yourself about 2 hours to see it properly and read the information boards along the way which explain the historical significance of the palace. There are many buildings to see and appreciate the architecture of the time. There are guards at the front gate wearing traditional costume with whom you can take some photos with if you wish. I enjoyed it very much.,449,hour
450,254,1955,"In time of beautiful red leaves, it is worth to visit. Not very overcrowded . Since the inner place is not open, an hour is enough.",450,hour
451,255,1987,"We took a quick tour of this palace but did not take the Secret Garden tour and hence cannot comment on that specifically. The palace is somewhat similar to Gyeongbokgung Palace but is worth at least a 1-2 hour visit. However, we felt that more signs could be put up along with the exhibits to explain in depth on the history of the exhibits and such.",451,hour
452,256,1991,"This was our 2nd visit to the palace and the Secret Garden this year, having seen it in summer, we wanted to see how different it would look in winter. As other reviewers have mentioned, the Secret Garden tour is a must-do (additional charges apply). Buy the tickets at the main entrance and they will let you know the timings of the tour and the language spoken.  Arrive at the entrance about 5-10 minutes before the start time, as once the tour starts and the guide leaves the entrance area, you will not be allowed to join in. There will be a lot of explanation of the different buildings and parts of the garden, and what they were used for in the past. Very illuminating and gave an insight into how Korean royalty lived.  At the end of the tour, you will be near the main entrance so you can go back and see the rest of the palace if you haven't completed it yet.  If you only visit one palace in Seoul, make it this one ! Takes about 2-3 hours in total, with the Secret Garden tour.",452,hour
453,257,1997,Must buy tickets and join tour for the secret garden. Palace tour is not necessary if you can't meet the tour timings. You can buy the book and read along. You can spend more than 3 hours there. There is rest stops for a drink.,453,hour
454,258,1998,"You need to plan ahead, if you want to visit this palace. There is free English guided tour or the palace (check their website for the tour schedule). The tour lasted for about 1 hour. Our tour started at 10.30am. We reached the entrance at about 10.40am (we didn't know about the tour). The guard was very kind and told us about the guided tour and rushed us in, to join the group.  If you want to visit the secret garden, you need to buy the tickets separately. If I am not mistaken, they only allocate 50 tickets for online booking (per visit), with remaining 50 tickets for walk-in customer. There were only 2 English tours per day, during December. When we were there, the tickets for the 11.30am slot were sold out by 10.30am. Some customers were sadly turned away. Fortunately, we pre-booked our tickets online. If you are dead serious on visiting the Secret Garden, you are advised to pre-book the tickets.  We enjoyed the Secret Garden tour tremendously, even though the scenery was not ideal, as it is winter now, so the trees look very bare, and the lakes were frozen. This was because we had a very patient and knowledgeable tour guide, who share a lot of interesting history about each section / building in the garden, with the group. This tour may not be suitable for toddlers and senior citizens, as some of the paths are rather steep (upwards and downwards) and may be a bit tiring.  Also, do take note that the tour is very long (over 1 hour). So, if you are rushing for time, this may not work for you.  The garden is really beautiful in autumn or spring (the tour guide showed us some pictures). I might return for another visit in the right season.  A plus point of having a mandatory guided tour in here, is that the garden is never crowded and you can easily get good photo. shots of the surrounding area.  A tip in buying tickets - if you plan to visit this palace + secret garden + any other palace in Seoul, you can save some money by buying the Palace Combi ticket. You can just request for it at the ticket counter.",454,hour
455,259,2001,"This place is closed on Mondays so please plan ahead or check the schedules on its website before coming over. We were there in late autumn and although it was sunny, the wind was rather cruel. For some reason, there were many student tours on that day so it was quite crowded.  To enjoy this place, would suggest to go for the free guided tours. We had a lovely lady who spoke understandable English and she gave us a lot of information about the place. It was wonderful listening to her explain. This place has a few English information boards around so you can walk around by yourself if you want to.  After the Chandeokgung tour, which lasted for an hour, we continued with the Secret Garden tour. For this tour, I think that it would be best to go in Spring or early Autumn. When we got there, the was still autumn foliage but most of the trees were becoming bare. To our understanding, you can only enter this place by guided tours. However, the 'attractions' inside are not really attractive and you would be better off walking by yourself and taking pictures of the scenery. This tour lasts about an hour and a half.  For the Secret Garden tour, I would not suggest those with walking problems, with toddlers who won't walk, pushing strollers or wheelchairs because the slopes are steep and there are a fair bit of stairs to walk. There were about 20-30 people in our 120 people group stopped midway because of these slopes and stairs.  Of the palaces in Seoul, I would say this is the best one to go to. Most palaces are built the similarly but they may have different histories.",455,hour
456,260,2004,"Very easily accessible from the hotel that we stayed in. Took a walk at the palace as we have few hours more before making our trip to airport back to Singapore. Love the red leaves and its so carefree to walk inside the palace, no hush and fuss. There is a small cafe right inside the Palace with inexpensive nice hot drinks. Enjoyed sitting at the cafe seeping the hot drinks we had with beautiful sunbeam casting through the beautiful autumn trees. We managed to catch the guard changing ceremony which is interesting.",456,hour
457,261,2023,"We planned to visit Changdeokgung Palace because it is one of the World Heritage properties and Secret Garden (inside Changdeokgung Palace) with beautiful Autumn leaves.  There are two kinds of tickets, one is for Changdeokgung Palace only (3,000 won) & the other is Changdeokgung Palace + Secret Garden (8,000 won with tour guide). We made ticket reservation on its website 1-week before the trip, all Chinese & English speaking tour guides were fully booked, we Chinese only had to book a ""Japanese"" speaking tour guide at 12:30 pm. If you want to know every place of its history, it is highly recommended to make the reservation on its official website as early as possible for a understandable language. No advance payment is required.  Upon arrival at the Secret Garden, we were a bit disappointed because it's too early for the beautiful Autumn leaves at the end of October, not much were seen. However, the weather is nice and comfortable, it took us 2.5 - 3 hours to walk, take pictures and enjoy the environment (without following the Japanese tour guide). It is a nice & relaxing place to visit. We may learn more of Its history on its official website or UNESCO's.",457,hour
458,262,2043,"It is interesting to explore the palace grounds and preserved buildings. Be sure to join a guided tour to understand more about it. The architecture and details on the outside are beautiful. Unfortunately in winter -when I was there- it seems they store the furniture and there are no entries allowed inside the buildings. Thanks to open structures you can nevertheless peek inside and see what the rooms look like. If you visit in winter, be sure to dress super warm. I froze my b*tt off during the hours I was strolling around at the palace grounds. The space is quite open and the winds catch you everywhere. Brrrrr.....

Many tour companies come and snatch up the tickets and you are out of luck. There are only 2 English tours a day for the secret garden, and you must join the guided tour for this area. A guided tour is not required for the rest of the palace area. The palace is located within city limits and very easy to walk to if staying in the Insadong area. A souveneir shop is within the grounds and washrooms. I was very happy with our timing coming at the beginning of November, as the autumn colours on the trees are breath taking! Dress warm if you do come this time of year as it got down to -2C at night. A lot of history to see, beautiful foliage and plenty of walking. Wooden ramps are everywhere so very wheelchair friendly if needed.",459,hour
460,264,2049,"Changedeokgung is a beautiful palace albeit much smaller than Gyeongbukgung. It was not too crowded when we visited on a Tuesday. We bought combination tickets for $10k Won each which allows one to visit the various palaces in Seoul as well as the Jongmyo Shrine. This includes the Secret Garden too. If you plan on visiting at least 2 of these attractions, it is worth buying the combination tickets. We arrived early and were able to join the first English speaking tour for the morning. It is good to join the tour (free) as the guide will provide commentaries and information as well as historical background to the many buildings / rooms within the palace grounds. We particularly enjoyed the little snippets the guide shared with us regarding the daily lifestyle & stories of the Kings & Queens who lived there. The tour last about an hour and it ends near the entrance to the Secret Garden. This was very well planned as we could immediately make our way to the next guided tour to the Secret Garden scheduled at 1130am.

The only thing that ChangDeokGung does not as well as its counterpart is its lack of a front colossal palace. Other than than, ChangDeokGung has a lot of very well maintained quarters, which gives the palace a very intimate feeling. But what is truly amazing about ChangDeokGung is the secret gardens between the actual palace. Beautiful, refreshing, harmonious, it makes the stress of a metropolitan city like Seoul go away instaneously. Expect 2 hours of visit for the palace itself and close to 2 extra hours for the garden.",461,hour

But if you do come here, make sure you go to the secret garden. You can only gain access on a tour, but you don't have to stay with the tour. Just wander around & admire it by yourself if you aren't so interested in the history & dates. The garden represents 2/3rds of the palace grounds & you can comfortably see them in about an hour to an hour & a half.",462,hour

Its not crowded with tourists, its surrounding is peaceful and quiet and it has a nice garden which you should visit. Its called the ""The Secret Garden"". There is a guide which will bring you around the garden, explaining the history. The tour will take around 1.5 hours and it cost KRW5000.

Some of the buildings and gates are original and dating from early 15 century. 1 hour to 90 min should be ok for a good visit. The tickets are cheap, as all the major attractions in Seoul, for this one for example the entrance is around USD3",464,hour
465,269,2113,"The palace is beautiful and the garden was also very nice. The architecture feels like a blend of Chinese and Japanese style. The palace ground is actually very large, so allocate about 1 hour minimum to see everything. We took the Secret Garden tour to see the back gardens and it was worth the 1.5 hour walk. The walk was peaceful and the English guide was entertaining, but I think it would be a little too taxing for the elderly given the slopes and the summer heat. In comparison to Gyeongbukgong, there are some similarities in architecture, but this palace feels more genuine. The skyline of the palace is very interesting, as it is right in the middle of a modern city against tall glass buildings. :-) A must-see place for first time visitors to Seoul.",465,hour

There is access to the 'secret garden' but it costs more so we didn't go. Try and go when its sunny as the colours on the buildings are better! Near to Insadong and other palaces/temples.

472,276,2149,"We just came to Korea from Japan and agree with a previous poster's sentiments. We did find the palace and gardens very underwhelming because of two reasons. The first being that the garden didn't appear to well kempt with algae covered ponds and paint peeling all over. It wasn't a place of beauty. It was nice enough. On top of that there were too many rest points for people who may be tired. This meant a 45 minute tour became a 90 minute one.  I recommend that you get the combination ticket if you visit another palace in addition to here. It costs 10,000won. You have to join a tour to go to the secret garden. We booked on the tour an hour beforehand. The tour group is very large. There are also palace tours, which may have added information and context to the palace.  Ultimately, for us it was underwhelming so adjust expectations if coming from Japan. That said for a few pounds or dollars you get to wander around a place of history.",472,hour
473,277,2157,"Another must-see when you visit Seoul. You must join a guided tour (not so many) but if you don't care about the commentary, you may as well join a Korean tours (every hour).

477,281,2181,"This was one of the better palaces we’ve visited in east asia. I highly recommend the guided tour through the secret garden (Huwon). The secret garden was the highlight of our visit to Changdeokgung and was well worth the additional entrance fee. The secret garden is created with minimal alterations to the surrounding woods which gives it a unique natural feel. The tour lasts 1.5 hours. You will be required to walk up a few slopes during the tour. So if you happen to visit in summer on a sunny day like we did, be prepared for a little perspiration or perhaps avoid the midday tours.  Outside the secret garden, I personally didn’t find the palace buildings too interesting. Having already seen the Forbidden City and summer palace in Beijing, I found Changdeokgung to be quite similar in terms of architecture and layout of the palace buildings. Of course, there will be subtle differences between Korean and Chinese palaces. As with many east asian non-functional palaces, you only get to walk on the outside for the most part. There are very few indoor exhibits to illustrate what the inside of the palace would have looked like in its heyday. However I would still recommend visiting this palace if you are interested in asian architecture. The palace buildings are decorated with intricate designs that shouldn’t be overlooked.",477,hour
478,282,2199,"Maybe my favorite palace in Seoul. The main attraction is the secret garden which is amazing. You can only enter the garden with a tour group, and the tour is an hour and a half long.

Do remember to buffer time as the entrance to the Secret Garden is a walk from the entrance of Changdeokgung and one can only enter with a tour guide. Tours are unfortunately not as frequent as one would wish. As the tour takes about one and a half hours, one is allowed to turn back anytime one wishes as the tour will end at a different exit from where it started.

I don't always like tours but there aren't that many places with the history and this tour was really well done and perfect for the surroundings. The secret garden tour is a must do...it is beautiful and great for pictures. Together, the tours are about 2 1/2 hours (60min for the palace & 90min for the garden). One thing is that especially during peak season or holiday times, you need to reserve early. We got luck as we were there 1 weekday and were able to get tickets because all the others were sold out weeks in advance. If you only do one palace in Seoul, I recommend this one but if you have time to do more, it is great to be able to compare them.",483,hour
484,288,2232,Traditional Asian style of palace. I had luxury to visit this with a local guy who told interesting stories. I would suggest to take one of the guided tours. You can spend hours here - but weather should be good as there's quite some walk outside.,484,hour
485,289,2235,If you'd like to do the 10:30 general tour and the 11:30 Secret Garden tour - make sure you give yourself a least half an hour of queing time. And pack some snacks. The palace was really majestic and the Secret Garden tour was quite lovely. The tranqulity of the gardens really seem other worldly relative to the hustle and bustle of the city and the queue.,485,hour
486,290,2238,"Go early, really. Plus the 'audio guide shop' was 'sold out' within the first hour we arrived! Until we asked a Korean lady who still managed to get them - the guides are actually available NEXT to the bureau de change! Plus you are required to place your passport with them as a deposit - But they do double check before returning the passports to you which is assuring. The place - just average for me - nothing much to see and gardens were just okay.",486,hour
487,291,2243,"The palace is a beautiful sight to behold in the spring. The architecture and ancient trees make any picture you take Instagram-worthy. If you are a bit of a history buff, be sure to sign up online for the English tour of the Secret Garden (Huwon) that happens thrice a day where the 1.5 hours guided tour takes explains the history and culture of the palace. It's also good for a look at the beautiful pavilions and libraries within the Huwon. Until May 11, those signing up for the secret garden section are allowed to stay within it past the guided tour bit. Camera trigger- happy folks will love this place! Location-wise it's walking distance from Anguk-station Line 3, and can spend your time exploring Insa-dong or Bukchon-ro before or after.",487,hour
488,292,2247,This palace is an easy walk from Anguk station on the orange line. Adult admission for the english language palace tour + secret garden tour was around 18000 won. There is an english brochure for 500 won. We took the 10:30 am palace tour followed by the 11:30 garden tour. The garden tour was 1.5 hours long. You can tour the palace on your own but to see the gardens you must be with a guide.  The guides wear traditional hanboks and both of my guides spoke good english. The palace tour is interesting and there was enough information without being overloaded with trivia. The garden tour however was more about the scenery. The lady talked about the functions of the different areas of the gardens but it wasn't very compelling. Also it was more enjoyable to not be in the throng of 50 people that were on the tour and to straggle behind.  I found this palace more interesting than Gyeongbokgung and it is much larger than Deoksugung.,488,hour
489,293,2252,"What I love about Seoul, is the contrast between the old and the new...modern buildings then smack in the middle is an well preserved piece of history. I am not usually a history buff but since I bought the palace ticket packet I felt that I would be miss out if I don't visit this palace. I felt that this palace a little bit more intimate than Gyeongbukgong..if a palace can be called ""intimate"". I was here primarily for the secret garden tour and my ticket pack already includes the tour. You cannot go on your own, even if you have a ticket ,as they try to limit the number of people, they only have limited tours per day so take note of the tour you want based on the language and be there a few minutes early. Be prepared for a little walk, as the garden winds up and down slopes and hills. The guides tell amusing stories about the names of the buidlings and how the old king named them. I was there end of March so the trees were pretty bare but I could just imagine how beautiful it would be in spring and fall. It's mostly dirt road so it is hard to push strollers or even wheelchairs. Bring water and go to the restroom before going on the tour, as there is only one store and restroom facilities in the middle of the tour which lasts about 1 1/2 hours",489,hour
490,294,2253,"Changdeokgung Palace is much more tranquil than the other two major palaces of Seoul. It is surrounded by lush gardens and greenery, which even in the winter’s snow can make Changdeokgung look remarkably picturesque, rivalling perhaps even the wintery sight of the incredible Ginkaku-Ji temple in Kyoyo, Japan.  The main garden here is called Huwon which is 78 acres of amazing tranquil greenery. Depending on the season, you can see snow, autumnal leaves or possible some cherry blossoms.  Changdeokgung is the longest-serving royal palace in Seoul, and this made me want to visit it to see what the fuss was about. I enjoyed an hour or so looking at the intricate architecture, but to the untrained eye you must remember that a lot of these palaces and buildings within them all look very similar, so unless you have a particular interest in Joseon Dynasty era palaces, then I think you should prioritise your palaces, and thus I must recommend Gyeongbokgung.",490,hour
491,295,2256,"Definitely worth the visit and inexpensive ticket price.  l recommend the small extra amount for the ""Secret Garden"" guided tour, although be prepared for a lot of walking.

492,296,2290,we visited in November so it was very quiet which despite the cold was actually very nice and peaceful as it felt like we were the only group around! we bought the combination ticket which allows entry into several palaces including the famous secret garden in this palace.  I would definitely recommend to book a tour of your language of choice as this makes the walk around much more interesting instead of walking around an empty palace! The tour guide was very informative and spoke great english.  I enjoyed the secret garden the most and it is possible to get some beautiful shots here! we managed to even catch some autumn red leaves!  if travelling in the winter do make sure to wear comfortable shoes and wrap up! the palace ground tour lasts for 1hour and then the secret garden tour for 90 minutes.,492,hour
493,297,2298,"Perhaps it was because I missed the English-speaking tour by 10 mins (and I didn't want to wait for the next one which was an hour and a half later), I wasn't too impressed.  Everyone told me the secret garden is the key to the visit, but without a guide, I couldn't enter. It was such a shame.  Overall, the palace is well-perserved, the architecture of the building is beautifully crafted and the surrounding is clean and serene. Even in the freezing winter, the palace managed to keep me walking for over an hour.  It's easy to get to Changdeokgung Palace with the subway, just drop at Anguk Station, get out of the station from exit #3 and walk 5 mins to the entrance of Changdeokgung.",493,hour
494,298,2299,"On a cold day in January, we saw only 2 other visitors BUT one could spend several hours viewing this lovely area on a nice day and we spent over an hour wandering among the many buildings and open areas. It was last reconstructed in 1867 and illustrates well the architecture of a Korean palace that originally dates back to 1405 though it was completely burned in 1592, restored in 1610, and was the main palace for the next 20 years. It is lovely setting, well laid out and it reminded us of Beijing's Forbidden City in miniature. There is a small but welcoming craft shop/coffee shop which gave our feet a break and gave our bodies a welcome waming. A real MUST for a visitor to Seoul.",494,hour
495,299,2306,"Can spend around 2-3 hours here, I did the secret garden tour which is longer than it needs to be but it is worthwhile.",495,hour

497,301,2316,"The difference of this palace is its Secret Garden, that you can visit only with a guided tour, for a very small fee. Check the hours for English tours before going there. You can also go just to enjoy the peaceful and quiet atmosphere too.  The sweet plum tea in the souvenir shop after walking through the place is really nice!",497,hour
498,302,2317,"We had the palace on the ""to visit"" list and it was definitely worth it. We went on a weekday so it was relatively quiet. It's quite a large area to cover but 2 hours was for us enough to see and read everything there was to know about (hope we didn't miss everything though) The entrance fee was 3000 Won and we bought a guide map for another 500 Won. In the little shop/restaurant we bought a hot chocolate and on our way we went. The buildings are very colorful and the grounds are well maintained. Easy to get to on the subway. If in Seoul you can't miss this!",498,hour

The english tours at all of them are 11 1 and 3 with changing of the guard on the hour. I would definitely take the tour so you know what your looking at. An added benefit to this palace is out the back gate is the blue house (the presidents house). As you can see a visit to this area of Seoul offers so much.",499,hour
500,304,2355,"We spent a couple of hours wandering around the palace grounds and doing the secret garden tour. Unlike most palaces/castles in Japan, in Korea you generally can't go inside the buildings, so keep in mind that you'll be outdoors the whole time when planning a visit. The extra 5000 won for the garden is worth it, and going on a tour helps you get the most out of the experience. The English tour guide was very knowledgeable and included interesting facts and anecdotes.",500,hour
501,305,2360,Beautiful palace that is wonderfully preserved. Was here for an hour since I was on a quick paced tour! So take your time to enjoy the site!!,501,hour
502,306,2369,"Impressive grounds and very peaceful. You don't need to join a tour for the grounds, but you do need to for the secret garden. The secret garden is huge and the tour took 1.5 hours, very interesting and worthwhile. The grounds themselves are not as extensive as Gyeonbokgung Palace and because there is no grass, it'snot as pretty in my opinion. However, right next door, as in the next street is one of the traditional 'villages' with the traditional houses. Yes it's a bit commercialised with a 7 /11 shop frontage and various other businesses, but you get the idea of how tiny the houses are/were and the narrowness of the streets in the old days.",502,hour
503,307,2370,"I actually prefer Changdokgung Palace more than Gyeongbokgung Palace as it is more peaceful and quieter. There are not many tourists too. The secret garden is worth the 5000won as you can see a different part of the palace and there will be guide touring you around. The tour is about 1.5hours.

505,309,2372,The palace in itself is very nice and easy to walk around in an hour or so. It's not the best palace in my opinion but what makes it stand out is the secret garden. You will need to join a tour to visit the part of the palace as it's closed off to the general public and a ticket costs an extra ₩5000. The tour lasts around 90 mins and is very informative. You get to see some awesome buildings and get a feel of how royalty really lived. Highly recommend this place!,505,hour
506,310,2376,One thing I didn't expect to see in Seoul during my 5 hour transit tour was cherry blossom/sakura trees and they were in the palace grounds. I liked seeing the elaborate architecture with colorful roofs. However I get to go into the Secret Garden much to my disappointment but seeing the pictures of it were still very beautiful. If I remember right I saw a shop where people could try on traditional costumes somewhere inside this palace.,506,hour

508,312,2389,"Entering this palace is such an amazing contrast from the past-paced life of modern Seoul. The moment you step through the front gates you are filled with a sense of serenity. I arrived two hours before my guided tour of the Secret Garden, and spent every second exploring the palace. Every intricate detail is beautifully maintained or restored. The Secret Garden tour is a must, you will be astonished at how easily you can breathe when you enter the area away from traffic and the cluttered city. Also, the architecture and symbolism throughout the garden is stunning- make sure to pay attention to your tour guide or do research beforehand. I recommend paying the extra 2,000 won ($2) for the 4 palace tour. You will be saving a significant amount, and Gyeongbokgung Palace is a 10 minute walk away. Make sure to grab some inexpensive and amazing street food on the way!  The palace is also close to many art museums and other monuments- plan for a BIG day!",508,hour
509,313,2408,"Did the 1 hour English tour and spent another 30 minutes walking around. Love the feel of this palace. The tour guide informed that only about 30% of the buildings that were original have been restored, but even despite that, I loved the feeling of being in a maze in what buildings were there. It is not so huge, but even with so many tourists, you could easily find a secluded area that gave a great sense of solitude. The tour was quick enough to be engaging, but no so long that you were waiting for it to finish. I really enjoyed visiting this Palace and hope you do too!",509,hour
510,314,2418,"The Changdeok palace is one of the finest palaces that I have visited in Asia. This should feature in your top 3 things to do in Seoul and for me, rates higher than the more famous Gyeongbokgung palace. I greatly recommend t that you take the English tour (10-30 am and 230pm). The guides are well informed, articulate and entertaining. I suggest that you take the subway. Prepare to spend 3 hours between the palace and the secret garden (3,000 won). Do carry water as the walk can get demanding especially is you visit in summer. Get off at the Anghok station on line 3 (station 328) and walk on foot from exit 3. Its a ten minute walk to the palace. The architecture is asymmetric beauty and is beautifully constructed in harmony with the topography. The secret garden tour is worth visiting and I must add that this palace is a UNESCO world heritage site. Its also remarkable as to how well restored the place is: considering that it was destroyed after the Japanese invasion in 1592.",510,hour
511,315,2422,"We visited Changdeokgung in June of 2013. We went there on a guided tour and spent around an hour at the palace. We started out watching the changing of the guards, which I can only recommend! It was great to see the guards in traditional clothing and the ceremony itself was great to see. After that we walked from the South to the North gate and saw the main points of the palace - the King and Queen quarters, the courtyards and we finished at the pond near the North gate, where we took beautiful pictures! Having a guide with us was great - but going by yourself to just stroll around the palace would also be great. This is a Seoul-must see!",511,hour
512,316,2447,"We went to the palace and secret garden on May 26, 2013. The English speaking guide was knowledgeable and was easy to understand. She did a good job at explaining royal life in the palace and its buildings. The tour lasted one hour which I considered appropriate. Then, we went to the second phase of the tour: the secret garden. The secret garden tour lasts 1.5 hours. You will see many pavilions and a lot of greenery. I found this part of the tour a let down as I was expecting more blooms and colors. Maybe there are more colors at a different time of the year. Meanwhile, the male guide was relatively easy to understand. He seemed to be pretty knowledgeable too. Overall, the secret garden tour was OK for a walking tour... Enjoyed the palace tour more... Happy travels!!",512,hour
513,317,2460,I like this more than the popular Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's also an UNESCO site with less visitors.  Definitely worth seeing. There is Changchenggung right next to it but you must buy admissions separately.  Buget 2 hours for both palaces.,513,hour
514,318,2463,"If you do visit the secret garden or on a secret garden tour, and plan to visit any other palace or the shrine, it is well worth it to buy an integrated palace ticket which covers all 4 main palaces, secret garden and the shrine. Once you have that integrated ticket, and booked a secret garden tour, just go to the ticket booth about 10 feet from the secret garden entrance and show your reservation and exchange your secret garden entrance ticket from integrated ticket booklet to a tour ticket. Very painless.  The secret garden is worth a visit, and if you have the time and can visit at night, it sounds like it would be a great experience to visit the secret garden under the hanging lanterns. Ticket can be reserved online as well. The tour is about 1.5 hours and there is one part where you will be going uphill for a bit, so dress in your comfortable shoes. There is only 1 spot where there is bathroom once you started the tour, so place your break accordingly.  I personally can't keep this palace apart from the other palaces when I am looking at my pictures, except for the fact that this is the only palace that has a secret garden. All the ponds and reading places are interesting. You will also visit the area where the king and queen have their separate quarters, with a room for the King's mother in between their bedroom intriguing. (there is a back door for the king to visit the queen however).",514,hour
515,319,2474,"I'm writing this review because after reading Lonely Planet and looking at the palace website I was confused about the entry details and I would like to set them out clearly for others. The information about Changdeokgung in Lonely Planet is wrong – I doubt the person that wrote it has ever visited this site.  Palace grounds - you can see on your own, you do not have to go on a guided tour. However, free one hour guided tours of the palace grounds are available in a range of languages and I recommend that you go on one - the content is interesting and the guides are good.  Secret Garden - you can only gain access by going on a 90 minute guided tour. At the time of writing English language tours start at 11:30 AM, 1:30 PM and 3:30 PM. I reserved a place in advance through the palace website and when I bought the combination ticket on the day of the visit I gave the reservation printout to the ticket seller. The number of places is limited to 50 in each tour and mine was full so it is worth the effort of reserving in advance.  The Visit Seoul Bukchon Hanok Village walk starts near Changdeokgung and I combined the Secret Garden tour in the morning with the 2pm Visit Seoul walk.

In terms of what there is to see this wasn't the most interesting palace I have ever visited but there are some aspects that caught my attention eg the underfloor heating system, it's a good way to learn something about Korean history and it makes for a very pleasant couple of hours.",516,hour
517,321,2484,"It is interesting to see how different the western version of royal living is from the eastern idea. Make sure to take the guided tours because as a westerner, nothing is what we are accustom to when we think of kings. The first tour is one hour and the garden tour takes an hour and a half. You will want more time to explore on your own though so plan accordingly.",517,hour

519,323,2497,"First of all, this palace (like most others in Seoul) is a recreation as the originals were destroyed many years ago by the Japanese. However, that said, its still a very good way to spend a couple of hours to see what the palaces looked like back then. We took the English guided tour and the guide was very informative and helpful. We even did the Secret Garden tour and like it as some of the more scenic buildings (e.g. old library/reading room building) are included only if you take the tour. There are about 4 or 5 palaces within a small area of Seoul but I think this is the prettiest of them all so if you only have time to see one, this would be my recommendation.",519,hour
520,324,2498,"We visited this palace in early April and really enjoyed our time here. Having already walked around Gyeongbokgung a couple of days earlier, we decided to take both tour options. You can visit the palace without a tour but the secret garden is only accessible with a guided tour. There are 3 tours per day in English (the website is very good and gives full timings on everything). We got there about 5 minutes before the English tour of the palace started and managed to buy tickets and still be on time. Entrance fee is entirely reasonable, especially by UK standards.  The palace tour started promptly and the guide was certainly not hanging around. We were marshalled off, had brief stops at each of the main points and marched on again. I felt a bit herded about but still enjoyed learning a bit more about the palace and culture therein. The guide's English was excellent but you still need to ensure that you keep close enough (the different rhythm and pitch of Asian speakers means you have to concentrate to understand everything). The whole palace tour took just under an hour and finished right by the entrance to the secret garden. The secret garden tour started just after the palace tour finished. There were far more people in this tour than in the palace tour so I suspect not everybody went for the palace tour beforehand. The guide's English this time was even better than the first one. In addition, we were given time at several stops to take photos, take in the scenery and just take things a bit slower. The secret garden tour took the full 1.5 hours and by the end of it our two daughters were both a bit bored. However, this was largely due to the fact that it was only 8 degrees and drizzling. Having spent 2.5 hours outside, we were all getting very cold (despite wearing winter coats and gloves) so I suggest you dress up warm if visiting outside summer. I would definitely recommend this place. The garden in particular is beautiful and you really wouldn't notice that you are in the middle of a busy city. Guides are very informative. If you want to warm up afterwards, I would recommend the Nescafe Cafe across the road - very warm and the coffee is good too.",520,hour
521,325,2499,"We visited the two major palaces of Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung on one day, and the latter was far more impressive for its history and heritage, well qualified for enlisting as a UNESCO world heritage site. Our visit was made all the more interesting and informative by a well-experienced guide who was fluent in her command of English and managed to cover the massive ground in an hour.  The heritage design and architecture of the palace came across vividly as a visual presentation of the Korean history. As an ethnic Chinese, one could not but be amazed by the wide use of traditional Chinese characters for designated palaces and literary arts of display, and wondered at the historical link between the two countries. Indeed, there was even the feeling that the design layout of the Forbidden City in Beijing was being modelled here.  There was a separate visit to the Secret Garden which we also took; but that came through as a disappointment. Our early arrival just before the spring cherry blossom might have accounted for the lacklustre scenary; but the absence of landscaping and plain layout of the ponds as their centre-piece came out far behind the serenity and tranquility of neighbouring Chinese and Japanese gardens. Indeed, we abandoned the trip (which costed more than the visit to the palace) less than half way through.  I would suggest fo first time visitors: Go for the palace but not the gardens.",521,hour

524,328,2509,"It is amazing how the structures were well preserved. Palace tour that started at 10:30am took an hour with an English speaking tour guide. One should join a guided tour to truly appreciate everything you'd see and start your imagination on how it was for the king, queen and others. It is unbelievable to see the original bridge (abt 600 yrs old) that connects the palace to the outside. One will be surprised to see and know how and why the rooms of the king and queen are such. Will not elaborate on this so that you'd get the surprise as well.  The Secret Garden tour is an independent tour that immediately followed the palace tour. The Secret Garden is the palace's garden. It took another 1 1/2 hours to cover the whole area. Had another lady tour guide who speaks english very well. Could have been as good as the palace tour but since the group was so large (at least 70 persons), it was difficult to be near her at all times. Thus, we missed the information she gave for a particular area or so of the garden. It would have been better if there were several english speaking guides and divide the group.  I would recommend both tours.",524,hour

528,332,2540,In general we are not so keen on tours but the palace tour in English was really interesting and due to our humerous tour guide very amusing. Without her we would just have taken some pictures of the place and left again. But the one hour tour gives you a better insight and knowledge about the daily live on the palace premises in ancient times. We enjoyed it and would recommend it.

You can only enter the Secret Garden with the guided tours (which are done in Korean, Japanese, English...etc?). Check online for the tour schedule. To enter, you will need to buy a pass with the Secret Garden entry.  We were on a tight schedule, so we went with the Japanese guided tour (even though we didn't understand Japanese!), as we had just missed the English one. The Secret Garden is the filming location for a few internationally famous Korean drama series - the tour will include points of interest (if it's the Chinese and Japanese tour, as many Chinese and Japanese are hooked on Korean drama!)  There are many buildings in the garden - the servants quarters and small lakes. The surroundings are very peaceful - it's a very relaxing stroll through beautiful scenery.  A word of advice : Wear comfortable shoes and a hat. You'll be walking for more than an hour, if you want to cover the whole palace grounds.",529,hour
530,334,2564,"I visited when the trees had turned color, so the views were full of amazing colors. Many of the buildings have been reconstructed after various Japanese invasions and destructive fires, and as is typical of Korean buildings are rather austere, with emphasis upon natural elements, such as ""scholar trees,"" interesting volcanic rocks and a 700-year-old Juniper tree. There are some heartbreaking stories attached to the final Korean residents of these structures, after the Japanese had taken over the country, displaced the monarchy and turned Koreans into abused and scorned subjects. However, the simple beauty of these buildings and more importantly the attached ""Secret Garden"" with its small pavilions situated among natural springs, pools and former waterfalls in a sort of enchanted Eden (only for the enjoyment of royalty at that time) is worth the effort to be there on Thursday when tours are available. English language tours were at 11 and 3:30 p.m. There are other language tours throughout the day. All the main Korean palaces are in relative proximity to each other, although it doesn't seem that way based on the subway stations each one needs. For example, at the entrance to the ""Secret Garden"" is the back entrance to another palace (costing only 1,000 won to visit) Changgyeonggung. The main hall was rebuilt in 1616 and is the oldest extant hall in Seoul. It's not a large palace, having been built for dowager queens, but I witnessed an older Korean woman who was clearly praying at both the main hall and the several wells located in the precincts, so the site has special significance for some. If you arrive early for the ""Secret Garden,"" spend an hour visiting this palace and looking at 400-year-old wooden beams in the main hall.",530,hour
531,335,2567,"This is the second palace visited on a Saturday (after Gyeongbokgung Palace) and is the only World Heritage Site of the 4 palaces. Arrived around 1pm and spent about an hour here following the numbering of the buildings in the provided brochure. Ticket costs KRW3000 (~USD2.70) with an additional fee to visit Huwon. If one is keen to see this ""Secret Garden"" then advanced booking is best. It seems the regular ticket will allow one to see many structures in this palace complex, but cover less than half of the area (Huwon is rather large).  The brochure which came with the ticket is an excellent one and quite sufficient for navigating through the complex, with rather substantial information for identifying unique features of the buildings and understanding the architecture. Changdeokgung minus Huwon seems much smaller than Gyeongbokgung and takes a shorter time to visit. However after seeing much in Gyeongbokgung, this required a bit more effort to appreciate. Also, worth noting is that the crowds seemed unavoidable here, probably due to the small size of Changdeokgung, the fact that it was visited later in the day and on a weekend.  Thought the blue tiled roof of Seonjeongjeon was rather unique, but personally found the Nakseonjae Complex stood out the most because of its simplicity, reflecting the character of the King who lived here.  Overall, a very good visit to Changdeokgung, and a worthy inclusion to exploring Seoul. Note that this palace is closed on Mondays. Also there is a month-valid combination ticket to visit the other three palaces and Jongmyo shrine nearby. These are all within walking distance but would be rather difficult to properly appreciate in one full day.  If coming by metro, Changdeokgung is accessible by Line 3 (Anguk station) Exit 3.",531,hour

533,337,2588,"Lived in Korea from 9/1995 - 9/1997 and visited this palace and the secret garden back then. It is nice to see that the place is as nice, if not nicer. Take your best camera and good walking shoes. The tour to the secret garden runs about every hour. Unless you are a history buff and need ALL the details, I suggest you sign up for the next available tour and when you enter the Secret Garden area you can just leave the group behind and stroll at your own pace.",533,hour
534,338,2590,"The Changdeokgung is a magnificent example of Royal Palaces and buildings. A good couple of hours is needed to do the complex justice. For a slightly higher entry fee, the gardens are well worth visiting.",534,hour
535,339,2624,Worth a visit to get an idea of Korean history. The guide was excellent and the visit lasted about one hour.,535,hour
536,340,2635,"Overall Changdeokgung Palace is a nice place. However I personally dislike the secret garden tour. It is a 1& half hour walking tour and the walking is really killing. Most of the time, we are walking uphill at a 80 degree angle which is very taxing on the knees. After the secret garden tour, we are too exhausted to go for our shopping.",536,hour
537,341,2637,"If you're palace hopping in Seoul, this one is highly recommended -- there are quite a few buildings to check out, regular English tours of the buildings and the Secret Garden, and plenty of spots for interesting pictures. You can check out the buildings unguided, and that would take up less than an hour (depending on how short your attention span is). I didn't get a guide and that's probably why I left thinking it was a pretty place but without much insight on the history (brochure was pretty thin and mostly served as a map).  Re Secret Garden, when choosing an exit option, the ""never before trodden"" one is okay -- they say it's hilly and long but it didn't feel like it was more difficult to walk that way than the ""retracing your steps to the entrance of the garden"" route. Budget 1.5 hours for the Secret Garden if you're guided (in certain seasons, you can wander about unguided). English tourists on the 11:30 run -- bring a sandwich and a drink! It's a huge garden, and you can't get lunch inside.  While there, see the Bukchon houses and Insadong -- these top tourist spots are all near the Anguk Station.",537,hour
538,342,2642,"Very lovely, colorful urban setting. Lots of schoolkids on field trips, some in period costume to learn about their heritage. Very clean, well-maintained palace in the middle of this huge, modern city. Visited with HanaTour during an 8 hour layover.",538,hour
539,343,2649,"The size of the palace is impressive, and if you take into account that the secret gardens are also part of it, you will definitely have things to see for a couple of hours. We did not visit the secret garden, because the reviews said that it's not the typical garden full of flowers. And we thought that we pretty much saw the korean style garden around the palace itself. However we also visited the Changgyeong palace, which you can get to from inside this palace (entrance next to the meeting point for the secret garden). From there we headed to the Jongmyo shrine, which was about a 15 minute walk. Besides its size, I personally didn't find anything outstanding about this palace. I have seen other asian palaces which were much more adorned - I honestly expected more design (inside and outside) that what it actually had. However the buildings are well maintained and the surrounding area / park is clean. The place is very dusty, so by the end of your visit you will most likely have to clean your shoes.",539,hour
540,344,2660,A very large site with numerous buildings and gardens. Maps and tourist info provided allow for easy navigation and understanding of the palace buildings and grounds. Well worth the time and a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the city surrounding the area. Spend about 2.5 hours - not enough time to see the gardens and plan to return someday.,540,hour
541,345,2661,"We very much enjoyed our visit to Changdeokgung Palace but more so our guided Secret Garden tour. We used the handbook that was given to us at the ticket office to self guide our way around the Palace, we probably only spent one hour wandering around before our secret garden tour. On the day of our visit there would have been around 50 people in our tour, the guide managed the number very well, waiting in most instances for everyone to catch up when walking from one site to another.  The tour lasts 1 hour and 40 minute, apparently Autumn is the best time of year to visit per the guide, but we very much enjoyed what nature had on offer, the cherry blossoms were out, and that's a nice thing. The secret garden was built for the sole use of the royal family in Joseon Dynasty, even today it is a peaceful place in a busy city. The water features are not as stunning as they would have been in the 1400s when they were designed, due to the growth of the city, so one can only imagine what is was like back then. There is a lot of walking on the tour, some steep hills and stairs to navigate, it is surprising how unfit most people were in our tour, young and old, and they would lag behind, but the tour seems to accommodate this.  As we were staying in downtown Seoul we were able to walk from our hotel to the Palace. I had reserved our places for the tour online the night before, but never needed to show my reservation number at the ticket office as they were plenty of tickets available on the day.",541,hour
542,346,2672,We only had time for one palace and we chose this one. It was a good place to walk around for a couple of hours. My kids enjoyed it and it wasn't too big. That kept them from getting bored.,542,hour
543,347,2673,"Very nice historical palace grounds, very similar to Gyeongbokgung Palace but not as grand in size and extravigance, The wooded grounds are beautiful and definetly worth a one time look for historical value and significance, an hour or so is pleanty of time for this one.  Note*** If you are short on time the two attarctions are similar enough that I would go with Gyeongbokgung, as it is by far the better attraction.",543,hour
544,348,2674,"A visit here will make for a pleasant hour or two of your day. There's not much to see except for lovely old buildings and gardens, so it's not mentally exhausting like a museum -- more like a walk in a World Heritage park.  Tours of the Palace and Secret Garden are offered in English at 11:30 and 14:30 (closed Mondays). There are tours offered in other languages at different times, but I'm sorry I can't remember them all. You must be on a tour to enter the Secret Garden, but you don't need it for the Palace. If you choose not to take a tour of the Palace grounds, make sure you grab one of the little green information booklets (free) from the entrance gate, as there isn't much signage to tell you what you're looking at.",544,hour
545,349,2693,"We visited early in the morning, not knowing the tour schedules. I remember enjoying the early morning walk with the chilly autumn air and the misty almost empty streets until we came to the gate of the palace, which I thought was*the* palace at first since it was so large.  We spent about an hour touring the place by ourselves and mingled with the other tourists reading the brochures and the markers until it was finally time for the English guided tour at 10.30 a.m.  There were actually many tourists around, most of them I think were Japanese or Korean, but the place was so large that the compound never felt full, it seemed rather empty even!  We were glad we joined the guided tour. There are much more fascinating facts to be learned about the buildings and the comings and goings of the Joseon dynasty members that we didn't find out just by reading the brochure or palace markers.  We didn't get to visit all the palaces in Seoul, but we were definitely glad we visited this one. Truly a beautiful and historical site.  If you are going there, wear comfortable shoes and prepare to walk a lot. The compound is big and will take about two hours worth of walking to explore sufficiently (not fully, I think you'd need a day or two for that). And don't miss the tour of the Secret Garden near the back area of the palace! This requires a separate entrance fee and has a different tour schedule.",545,hour
546,350,2696,"The location of the palace is very easy to get to: you can either take the Seoul City tour bus and stop here, or you can take the metro and alight at the station (there are signs in the subway that will direct you to which exit is closest).  There's always a line outside so be mindful of the crowds. There's an entrance fee, and you can purchase a ticket from a booth located outside the main gates. You can also opt for an English tour, which only goes for certain times in the day (we chose the 11 am slot). The tour doesn't start on time because the guide wants to get as much of the English-speaking people together as possible (there was only one person doing the tour for about 20 people). This particular tour goes on for around two hours and only covers the palace grounds; you'll have to purchase another ticket for the Secret Garden tour, which only goes in the afternoon (in my case it had been around 2 pm).  Because we were so many, it was hard to hear the guide speak. She was dressed in a bright and colorful Hanbok (I think so it's easier for us to spot her) and brought around a small microphone but we still strained to hear what she was talking about. She also had a folder with pictures of things so we had a visual of stuff she talked about. You can ask her questions if you misheard something or would like to learn more, but I recommend you do this aside so it doesn't prolong everyone. It's very scripted and impersonal. In every station she allots a few minutes so you can take pictures or explore the area on your own before moving on. As I mentioned earlier, this was just a tour of the main palace, so she took us to the sleeping quarters, the library, the ritual house, the kitchens, the receiving area, the bridge, etc. On the day that we went it wasn't crowded so we were able to take photos without random people in it.  The tour of the Secret Garden was the highlight of this experience. You buy a separate ticket and can opt for the English tour as well, but others just choose to walk the course by themselves (which eventually you will do because the place will absorb you). The grounds are MASSIVE. The emperor had it right having a whole freaking park as his backyard. He and the crown prince had their own libraries, and plenty of pavilions that allowed you a view of, say, the lake from different angles. The buildings are pretty far from each other (you will mostly just walk) because they go with the natural flow of the mountain. Our tour guide (dressed in the same bright Hanbok and armed with the same tiny mic) was a little scary because she looked like she was having a bad day. She wasn't very open to questions and those she did answer she returned with monosyllables and a glare. Her pace is just right, allowing maybe 7 minutes per station (including photo-taking), and she keeps reminding you that you can go off by yourself and never get lost as long as you follow the paved path. I should mention that before you start the tour, you should head to the bathroom because there are no others in the area save for the one at the souvenir shop near the entrance. You should also bring an umbrella along during their rainy season, because chances are it WILL rain and there is nowhere you can seek shelter. Also bring a water bottle because it is a long walk and you may get thirsty along the way.  They have justifiably named this a world heritage site, and you cannot pass this up when you come to Seoul.",546,hour
547,351,2698,"I spent a couple of hours visiting this palace, taking one of the few English-language tours available. It was very crowded on the day, as the other main palace was closed so all tourists flocked here. Even so, it was an interesting visit and an opportunity to learn a few things about Korean history and culture. Sadly I did not make it to the secret garden, as I ran out of time, but this attraction is well worth a visit! A word of warning for people with physical impairments. There are some extremely steep steps to climb so don't be disappointed if you won't be able to see every part of it. Still, there should be plenty to make it worth your while.",547,hour
548,352,2701,Had taken the Secret Garden two hours english tour and was wonderful to know and understand Korean culture and its history. Must visit for anyone who is interested in knowing these things. The palace was also ncie.,548,hour
549,353,2702,"I had previously reserved an 11.30 am Secret Garden tour in English but underestimated the travelling time from my hotel to the Palace grounds. Thankfully, the reservation did not include the entrance fees which had to be paid on admission. So I managed to book a 2.30 pm slot for W8000 (palace entrance plus tour). Once the ticket is booked, you can enter at any time but for the Secret Garden tour, you need to assemble at its own entrance located 600-700 m into the palace grounds before the tour starts.  The palace grounds were large and extensive and built largely to the precepts of Buddhist philosophy. Compared to other Asian palaces, while it wasn't unattractive, I found this one to be fairly sparse and less lavish. I didn't hire a guide but generally didn't need one as simple explanations were placed strategically at each important location. The main highlight, as many reviewers have mentioned, is the Secret Garden tour. The gardens were a complete contrast to the main palace grounds - lush, tree-filled, and a world away from the noise noise and heat outside. Our guide, dressed in traditional Hanbok outfit, led the group through the various attractions and gave us a reasonable explanation of what we were looking at and how the royals lived in previous centuries. One thing that cannot be underestimated is the length of the tour - 1.5-2 hours. Although there were numerous rests, it can still be tiring because many areas are very hilly. Some paths were also not paved, and the sandy ground underfoot could be somewhat slippery, so wear good walking shoes. Apparently, the Secret Garden can be done without joining a tour in late-October when large crowds visit to see the fall colours,",549,hour
550,354,2703,"This palace, now in Seoul, was originally built in the early 1400's and restored in the early 1600's. Beautiful architecture and grounds. I went there with Korean friends and we spent a few delightful hours exploring this historical site.",550,hour
551,355,2706,"In contrast with the more formal Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung looks like a pleasant place to live, especially with its extensive attached secret garden. The casual visitor may only see a collection of buildings, but each closer look reveals new touches, as if peeling an onion... Walking through the grounds, one will at times catch a particularly harmonious fleeting glimpse, be it an alignment of roofs, a mountain through a small gate, a wall accommodating a tree, etc. The large number of healthy-looking birds further confirms that this is one of the nicest green spots in Seoul :) Attached is a picture of the schedule of the various guided tours in their respective languages. My English-speaking guide spoke unaccented colloquial US English. Be warned that the secret garden tour is arduous for elderly people, as the footpath includes some uneven stone stairs, and the tour is almost 2 hours in length, with few opportunities to sit.",551,hour
552,356,2707,"The Palace itself is nice, though similar to others. The entrance fee is cheap. If you want to visit the secret garden you should know that it is a guided tour that will take 1-2 hours, but I am not sure when the tours start. I do know there is one at 2:30pm. But other than that I am not sure, perhaps they are every half hour or hour, I don't know, we did not have enough time as we were headed back to our hotel to catch the bus to the airport, so we didn't get to visit.  There is also another palace you need to pay for inside, also not expensive, it needs about an hour, I think we went inside there, walked to the other entrance and then walked to get something to eat. It is a nice walk through the area  The rest of the palace is interesting, if you have some extra time and not sure where to go, I think it is worth seeing.",552,hour
553,357,2711,"I took a guided tour to the Changdeok Palace. The palace was the site of the last Korean royal court. It is well preserved in a beautiful ground. I find the rear garden with the pavilion and lotus pond especially enjoyable. The guided tours, required in most days and offered in various languages, are well worth it. It covers nearly the entire ground in 1.5 to 2 hours. Our guide is very friendly and knowledgeable. I like her telling the stories and how the royal court functions.",553,hour

556,2,30,A wonderful palace to visit when you come to Seoul It is a lot less busy than Gyeongbokgung Palace which makes your visit to it seem a lot more personal and intimate Whilst here you can marvel at the architecture of the palace and its surrounding buildings or take a stroll through the many gardens and paths or relax at the lake There is so much to do in this place and I recommend you spend a minimum 2 hours here to fully appreciate it Would love to come back here,556,much
557,3,57,It was a really nice afternoon sadly the secret garden was closed apparently you had to prebook tickets which we were unaware of the sign said for covid but I met a person the next day who said she went the same day and possibly time as us so prebook those tickets if you want to see the gardens For the rest of it I thought is was much more beautiful than Gyeongbokgun Palace but it did seem a bit smaller Well worth the visit if youre in Seoul,557,much
558,4,90,"Stunning palace. I have a lot of time in Seoul and Korea so going to see all the palaces. If your time is limited, definitely do this one. Time your visit accordingly with the mandatory guided tour of the Secret Garden. Annoyingly they appear to change timings so check online the day before your visit. I got there at 09:00 when they opened. I was the first person inside. I walked around the palace grounds myself for just over an hour and then did the English guided Secret Garden tour at 10:30 which finished around noon. Lasts about one and a half hours. You can leave the tour after fifty minutes as the last part is quite a bit of walking including uphill. For most of us it is fine but others were struggling with the heat even though it was early and parts of it are uphill so be mindful. I spent in total three hours there. Separate ticket for the palace and Secret Garden. They do have guided tours of the palace itself but to be honest, you can easily do this yourself. They give you a booklet plus there are information boards. Suggest going early as soon as it opens. It was beautiful and peaceful and you could freely walk around and enjoy the setting, also getting some good photographs. When I left at noon, it was much busier. Grounds are clean and well laid out. The palace was stunning. I loved the details of the doors and the architecture. There is a cafe and what appeared to be an art or souvenir shop on the premises. I didn't bother with it. Take water with especially if you are there for three hours like me. There are restrooms too. My thoughts. The Secret Garden is apparently the highlight. Whilst this was nice, I think the weather will contribute towards your experience. We had a lovely day and the sun shining with the reflection on the water and the colours of the leaves made the gardens look very pretty. However, we can't control the weather and I would suggest thinking about this if you have a day with bad weather. Parts of the garden were nice but other parts started to look the same. I started to get bored as did a lot of the group. I was glad I went though. The guide was difficult to understand (although the tour was in English) but there are information boards as well along the route which also provide useful facts. They limit the number of people on the tour so purchase a ticket as soon as you arrive.",558,much

560,6,108,"Set within a large park, accessible by subway, bus or tour, this Prospering Virtue Palace was built during the Joseon Dynasty. It served as the main palace for nearly 270 years following its destruction during the Japanese invasion and its subsequent rebuilding. A visitor may note that one building in particular, the Seonjeongjeon Hall is the only building featuring a tiled blue roof. There indeed is a love story to the history of this exquisite and beautiful palace, yet I shall leave that for the visitor to enjoy on their visit.  One detail in particular that distinguishes this palace from other palaces of the Joseon Dynasty is the palace gardens, and I am already planning my return trip to behold the “Quintessence of Joseon-era Landscaping” in spring or summer, to step where Kings and Queens strolled, relaxed, and perhaps engaged in sericulture. To truly savor visiting the Changdeokgung Palace I need to walk its gardens, valleys, pavilions and behold the lotus ponds and then see the Palace from otherwise hidden views. The Secret Garden occupies more than half of the entirety of Changdeokgung Palace, and I am delighted to plan my return to see the views from the Buyongji Pond and Juhamnu Pavilion, Aeryeonji Pond and Uiduhap, the New Seonwonjeon (New Royal Shrine) and so much more.  In the meantime I hope you enjoy my photographs of Changdeokgung Palace.  Please note that the admission to the Changdeokgung Palace is separate from the admission to the Secret Garden and, at least as of this writing, there is (but verify this) a Royal Palace Pass valid for 3 months from the purchase date, which includes admission to the Changdeokgung Palace and the Secret Garden; the Gyeongbokgung Palace; the Changgyeonggung Palace; the Deoksugung Palace; and the Jongmyo Shrine.",560,much

Read reviews that this palace was designed to be in harmony with the environment and after arriving there, it can be observed as to how it is. For a Palace, it is certainly not imposing as the Gyeongbokgung one and certainly no surprise why many princes chose to have their palace here. Unfortunately, I did not follow any guided tour for the front part if the palace, thus may have missed much interesting snippets.  However the guided tour to the ""Secret Garden"" is a must. Only entered with a guided tour, they are conducted at different times for different languages.

It is also common to see people dressed in the garb of that time period which really adds to the atmosphere as you wander the grounds. There is so much history here. And if you are there in the summer, bring the sun umbrellas. It is hot and rain is frequent at that time of year. The little cafe has limited offerings, so you may want to bring food.

Tourists are not allowed inside much of the covered areas and most of the time you are out in the open. So it can be harsh during summers. But still if you are touring seoul this is one of the must do activities. Just be prepared for the walk and the sun. The secret garden tour is amazing and can only be taken as a guided tour of roughly 70 min duration in summers and 90 during other times. Most of cultural heritage sites including this palace in seoul are free to enter from Aug 10 -25, due to National Liberation Day celebrations...however secret garden tour is paid and needs to be booked atleast a day prior.

I was mesmerised by it to be honest. I intended to spend a couple of hours, a half day at most, but ended up spending pretty much a whole day here. The gardens are extra, 5000 won, but are well worth it. The place is stunning obviously but don't rush through the inner and outer courtyards as they are just as enchanting.

The gardens are the main reason to visit and they are lovely (no flowers, all trees and greenery when we went in June - well maintained) but I would say beyond walking around the gardens, there wasn’t much to do. The entry price was only 1,000 won which is cheap but for that you can’t get inside any of the buildings and when it is hot, it’s a bit relentless.

576,22,253,"The palace is very nice, but the garden is so much nicer. Lots of trees, so a nice place to visit on a hot day. Entering the garden is kinda weird. You have to buy a ticket for a specific time and only at that time you can enter the garden, even though the sign at the garden entrance says you can just go in on your own. You can choose to do a guided tour or walk around on your own.",576,much
577,23,258,Glad that we sign up for this moonlight tour. The atmosphere at night was so different from the day where it was much more peaceful except that it can be quite scary if you're walking alone. It's so beautiful at night walking around with a lantern on hand.  Get to see more of it and understand better from the guided tour despite having tour this place in the last trip.,577,much
578,24,293,This palace is one of the Joseon Dynasty king's favorite and it is much beautiful and calmer than Gyeongbokgung since it is near the secret garden. It is the only palace in Seoul that has granted UNESCO World Heritage.,578,much
579,25,320,"今年秋天終於排上日程，剛好可以參加古宮的夜間導覽。 ＊注意!外國人只有周日場次。我提前一個月上網買票，因為聽說很熱門，有時可能搶不到票。 前些年已經去過兩次昌德宮，但這是第一次夜間參觀，氣氛格外不同，安靜、神秘、美好。英文導覽員的英文很好，說得不多，但很清楚。記得一定要早點報到，因為是所有隊伍一齊在門外集合，等門開了才會魚貫進入。(自己腦補: 等待的時候有點像古代朝臣在宮門外等候上朝的那種感覺^^) 其實夜間能看到的古蹟特色比較少，畢竟天色已暗。但另有一股韻味(不透露太多，才能好好體會)。雖然收費較高，但包含一場很不錯的國樂與舞蹈等表演，還有小小點心盒。 *注意: 入秋後首爾日夜溫差大，整場tour都在戶外，若當天剛好遇上低溫冷鋒之類的，建議帽子、圍巾、手套都戴上。 *景福宮也有夜間參訪，買票時記得看清楚是景福宮(星光紀行)還是昌德宮(月光紀行)。兩者內容稍有不同，票價與時間長短也有差異。 I visited this palace twice before during daytime. This was my first Moonlight Tour to this ancient palace. It provided a different feel when walking in the quiet night. Open your ears and eyes, for there's music and performance. * This tour is only offered in a limited period ever spring and autumn. For foreigners, only Sunday nights are available, so plan your tour ahead if you're interested. * If you want to really see the beauty of architecture, visit during daytime -- it's really dark during this Moonlight Tour so you won't be able to see much palace features. * They would give you an earphone guide-set and a lantern to light your way. The English guide spoke good English. Note: The more famous palace -Gyeongbokgung- has a nighttime tour too, called Starlight Tour. There's some difference in the content of these two tours. In sum, this Tour is totally worthwhile, and it provides a unique experience. Keep warm, though, for temperatures could drop suddenly in spring/autumn nights in Seoul. Arrive early to check-in -- all visitors would lineup and wait for the gate to open and enter all-together. You can purchase online beforehand. The tickets could sometimes be sold out since this is a popular tour.",579,much
580,26,325,"Seoul has a few royal palaces. Changdeokgung was in use far into the 20th century. The thing with these palaces is; once you have seen one, you have pretty much seen them all. When you visit Seoul for the first time I certainly wouldn’t recommend to go see all palaces. One, two max, is more than enough. Changdeokgung is perfect for a quiet stroll on a lazy Sunday afternoon. From the back gate you can walk straight into Changgyeonggung palace. These two palaces are a haven of peace in busy Seoul.

The structure looks practically the same and there are so many small doors leading to small streets that you may get lost in it. But I like this one better than the gyeongbokgung, maybe because not so many people visiting it so not that crowded, you can really enjoy the scenery and imagine how the life’s like there when it’s still used by the royal family.",582,much

The scale is much smaller, but prettier I think. Many of the buildings here were open for display, so you can see what the rooms looked like. There are so many buildings and small paths to walk around here, you can get lost. I did not do the private gardens, I will keep that for next time. The entrance price was cheap and this palace was easy to get to. If you don't have time to visit all the palaces, I recommend visiting Changdeokgung Palace.",584,much

In fact, I'd much prefer Changdeok due to its size (smaller palace ground) but no less beautiful and intricate. It also has Secret Garden palace (you need extra ticket to get in, famed for its beautiful ground and garden). With Changdeok, you got to see buildings and its functionality, its architecture and also history (progression). The colorful walls and ceilings are such a wonder, the neat design of the buildings are a marvel in itself. It's worth a visit for palace, architecture, and historical geek. You can definitely take great pictures in the compound, because there are many great spots to shoot.",586,much

No regret if you cannot enter the Secret Garden due to full booking in summer. Landscape and scenery are nothing special there. It was very humid in July when I went there. But I believe its scenery would be very beautiful when maples blossom in fall.  In general, the buildings of Changdeokgung Palace outside Secret Garden are much better than those in Gyeongbokgung Palace.",592,much
593,39,457,"My mother and I did a secret garden tool of the palace. It was not that great.  The tour was in Chinese since my mother only speaks chinese. It was a free tour offered by the park. The group was about 30 people with some family with young children and seniors.  The tourist guide was not good at all. Her Chinese was not clear, so most of the time we could not understand her. The garden itself is also not what we expected. It's not a botanic garden with flowers and plants, rather it's a big wooded area with natural trees on hills up and down. There were few residence halls here and there. So really not much to see. The guide walked very fast and never bother to check on anybody. It was like a hiking trip with climbing up and downs. The last draw was that the guide lead the group to an almost vertical up stairs in the bushes and just went up without asking anybody if they could do it. I would not risk my mother breakkng her leg gojng up there. So, with some other families with young children we had to look around to find another way out. It was totally unprofessional! We went to see other parts of the palace and didn't find the impressive. All the big halls have tall stairs to climb, so not easy for elderly.  I don't recommend the secret garden tool. Especially if you are not fit for hiking.",593,much

596,42,489,We walk here from City Hall where we were staying. The main entrance is now opened as I remember that it was under reconstruction then. There were guards doing sentry duties and they attracted much photo session. I was delighted to be granted free access being a 'Senior Citizen'. It's the usual visual to see how royalty live in the past. Lots of ground to cover as the site is huge. Highlight for me is to see a lot of folks wearing traditional Korean costume. And many were foreigners renting and wearing them. I said hello to a group of students from Indonesia dressed in the hanboks. I greet them in Bahasa which surprised them.,596,much
597,43,495,"I think if you visit Seoul, you have to go to one of the palaces. We went on a busy, sunny, weekend and it was very enjoyable. There's lots of places to walk around, and it's much different from the palaces and castles back home.  Rent a hanbok!!! There're loads of places nearby, very reasonably priced, and it makes the whole experience more fun. Also, free entry if you do so.  Whilst here we were approached by people (I want to say high school students?) who asked us to vote on things we liked about Korea. No idea why they were doing this, but it was fun to speak to new people. Also a lot of people taking pictures for each other.",597,much

There are very few building that are open, and most that are aren’t terribly ornate. You walk around and look at the exterior of the building with the doors all closed and all the mini complexes have the same architecture. It becomes rather repetitive. I don’t feel like you need to spend too much exploring every corner of the palace, hit the highlights and move on. The Folk Museum you can access for free is probably the best part, very informative on Korean culture. Keep you ticket stub for re entry to the palace grounds.",599,much

Given that it was weekday, the group was not huge (30?) and the guide was really great at making sure we all kept up and heard what she told us aboutt he palace, the symbolism and the lives of the Korean royals.

They sell separately for secret garden ticket and palace entrance ticket. for me its pretty good deal. I dont have to queue for bought entrance ticket for each palace I want to. Changdeokgung is massive palace, but maybe not as big as Gyeongbokgung. But in this palace there is a secret garden that can only be enter in certain time. and must be guided. it even got secured by 2 security personel. I got here only 2 hours before closed. So I didn't get much around the palace itself. We straight to secret garden entrace, and thank god the guide wasn't there yet. after the guide arrived we enter the secret garden. don't worry the guide was speaking english, also there is a chinese tour for certain time.  the guide told us that Secret Garden can only be enter by the king himself, other people can enter this side of the palace only by king permission.  so its truly a privileges for us to enter this secret garden. the garden is very much preservative and I can see why you can only enter in certain time and with personal guide.  Its like went inside another world, its not like seoul.. when you enter you can only feel peace. the air is different, even though the city just right upon you.  I just want to stay there as long as I could. But I could not because the guide only give us 10-15 minutes spare time for each site we visit. wear a nice and comfy shoes because the walk can take for 1-1,5 hours. and there quite few hills. my friend just went under surgeries last month and can't take the hills very well. security guard was nice and keeping her a company when we continue our tour.  for me if you visit seoul and have extra time. do visit this palace and secret garden for certain.",604,much

For example, it does offer a bit more history and authenticity as it is quite a bit older than the other palace which was only recently rebuilt. A major part of the palace are the hidden gardens which were closed when we were there. I can imagine how spectacular those would be on a beautiful day and how much they would add to the experience.",607,much

They are similar in many ways - well-preserved, beautiful, with extensive grounds and many buildings to explore - but Changdeokgung has much larger grounds, which you can tour if you have a special ticket. When you first arrive, you can buy an entrance ticket to the palace, and at the same time can ask for an entry ticket to the ""Secret Garden."" This allows you entry at a specified time but doesn't cost anything extra. I've gone twice and once they just let us in at that time and we were free to wander at will. The second time, there was an English-speaking tour guide who showed us a few of the most important sights within the garden. It is amazing how quickly you feel immersed in nature, even though you know you are in the center of a bustling city. It is so quiet and serene - just the thing when city life gets too overwhelming. Definitely wear your walking shoes - the paths are smooth and wide, but the garden is very large and hilly so it requires a bit of stamina to see it all. Young children or anyone with limited mobility will find it tough to see the whole thing.",608,much
609,55,608,"the palace is quite lovely, and would probably be much nicer in the spring, or summer when plants are in bloom. as for the winter visit, there was a lot of large open space, so the wind was blowing, and the temperature quite low. the buildings themselves are lovely. you cannot enter any of them, you just stand at the top of the steps ( 3-5 steps usually) and look into the buildings. however i did start to watch a movie on the flight home called ""the king's case note"" ( by coincidence) and it was filmed inside the actual buildings of the palace, so i got a really good idea of how the king would have lived, and what it would have looked like many years ago!",609,much

While you are free to walk around in the palace grounds, the Secret Garden can only be visited with a guided tour (5000 W, ca 80 mind, 2-3 English language tours per day). Various ponds, landscaped gardens and side buildings. Our guide was knowledgeable and spoke very good English. Recommended tour even in Winter.",611,much

I waited 30 minutes in line and lucky to buy last tickets for 15:30 in the morning :) but it totally worth my waiting I was touched by my city. So much history in it and such a beautiful garden. It is different style from China and Japan. Focus on nature itself no artificial no frills very natural! It calms my mind!,613,much
614,60,650,"As far as palace goes, I very much prefer the much grander Gyeongbokgung Palace. But this palace has something that draws you in the moment you step in the secret garden (you have to take a tour for this). My guide is amazing and you can almost imagine the royalties walking the path towards the secret garden for some R&R. The fall colours make the place even more magical than the name suggests, making you wish you have a secret garden of your own too.",614,much
615,61,654,I would definitely recommend you dress the part when visiting the palaces around Seoul. It's a great place to check out the history of Korea and immerse yourself in the Korean culture. It's so much fun to dress up with your friends and take pictures. If your going to rent a hanbok (traditional Korean attire) I would plan to do it for more than two hours so you're not restricted especially if you like exploring and taking pictures.,615,much

You can only visit Huwon by tour and there are strict rules to stick with your tour group of 40-50 people so you can't explore by yourself and there's always tons of people milling around--definitely makes for a less-than-peaceful experience. Also, Huwon was pretty, but not breathtakingly beautiful--at least not in the summer. All said, I don't think you'd be missing out on too much if you only visited Gyeongbokgung and skipped Changdeokgung.",620,much
621,67,733,If you're going to select one palace - this is the one.  Many different buildings in this palace area - all with slight differences to suit its purpose. Definitely do the Secret Garden tour - so much lush greenery and a very scenic/peaceful walk through the garden - I would have loved a study/library in a garden growing up!  Look up the tour times before you arrive to make the most of your trip. A few cafes and coffee places across the road from the Palace once you're done with your trip.,621,much

I didn't have time to go into the secret garden, plus it was the middle of winter, but it was a lovely morning, well spent.

However Changdeokgung is good enough to enjoy the gung with nice weather, beautiful building and so on.

The tour takes you through the grounds and into a couple of the buildings, but more importantly takes you too the Hidden Gardens, ponds, and summer retreat palace buildings. Korean landscaping is much more natural than other gardens.  If you only have a couple days in Seoul, I put this high on the list of places to go. It is in central Seoul and close to Gyeongboekgung, Insadong, City Hall, Myeongdong, and Namdaenum.",633,much

You would be amazed how much you can learn by observing the way they interact with each other, how they respect their culture and people. I was truly amazed!!!",641,much
642,88,968,"We had an excellent afternoon including a secret garden tour. Without the tour I think it would be hard to enjoy or learn much during a visit, but the information and history provided by the guide during our 75 minute tour were really interesting and nice. Perhaps the group size was bigger than it should have been, but anyway it was a nice afternoon and without the tour it would have been a big disappointment.",642,much
643,89,986,"The palace could be more beautiful during fall, but I visited in winter so it looked the same with other palaces. We booked the huwon garden tour, and again, the tour guide said that the garden was much more beautiful during fall. In winter, it is all snow and frozen ponds. It was nice to hear the tour guide leading us through history, though.",643,much
644,90,997,"Highly recommended for a visit. This huge Palace complex is a fine example of Korean historical architecture and culture. The grounds were stunning, particularly in Autumn - it's a photograper's dream, particularly with the young local people dressed in traditional dress ( a lovely, popular current trend). Very reasonable entrance fee and so much to see there.",644,much
645,91,1006,This palace is neat to look around...not much on display but the area is nice with some fantastic scenery. Whilst there we learned that it is in the process if being rebuilt and so not much of it at all is actually historic.,645,much
646,92,1009,The size of the Palace is average but the buildings are quite well maintained . The secret garden though not much to be seen but can see that it was once quite a beautiful one.,646,much
647,93,1018,"Tip: You can book the secret garden tour a week in advance (I suggest you do so as it's limited to 100 per slot). The English tour starts at 11.30am.  Be at the palace early to roam around and join the 10.30 General Tour (English) around the palace grounds. You will still make it for the 11.30am secret garden tour which takes 1.5 hours.  Following the tours make it so much easier to appreciate and understand the stories behind the buildings. You can either choose to get off Jongno 3 ga station (exit 6) or Anguk station (exit 3) depending on where you stay.  We got the Royal Palace Pass which is 10,000 won and allows us entry to 4 palaces (including Gyeongbokgung) and the Jongmyo Royal Shrine.",647,much
648,94,1022,"You must visit at least one Palace in Korea, once you have done one, well they are pretty much the same and well worth the visit.",648,much
649,95,1042,"I enjoyed this Palace very much, it was a sprawling beautiful location. We missed the cut off for going into the garden, but I will just have to go again. It's very affordable, especially if you get the special discount for the multiple locations!",649,much
650,96,1049,"We bought tickets for this palace along with tickets for the secret garden tour. Unfortunately, the tour guide for the secret garden had somewhat stilted English (and was thus a bit difficult to understand) and the tour was quite boring, so we just ventured out on our own after a while.  The palace is humongous so be prepared for a very long walk. Also note there really isn't much food you can purchase within the palace itself except for some drinks, so be prepared for that as well.  The palace does get a bit repetitive at times, although the nicely manicured grounds do make up for it.",650,much
651,97,1060,"So much into Korean royalty history. So interesting to see the King's palace and the Queen's palace, how they rule and what their restrictions are. The architecture and very detailed designs of the palace are impressive. They have maintained these sites so well without altering the original set-up. When you're in Seoul, at least visit one of these heritage sites. This requires lots of walking and climbing of stairs. You need need to be fit though but good walking tour.",651,much
652,98,1067,"Very attractive palace buildings with interesting architecture and interiors making a pleasant change from temple visiting. But don't expect to have the place to yourself. It was very busy, but this added to the character as many were in national costumes. Due to time restraints we were not able to visit the secret garden, which is a shame as photos we have seen make it look well worth visiting too. Would recommend having a local guide to make the most of your visit as there is much to understand.",652,much
653,99,1084,Part of the tour was a visit to Changdeokung Palace. Its design is not as detailed and intricate as that of Gyeongbokgung. It is much simpler and there were few people who visited this palace. Considered as Changdeokgung Palace was recognized as a World Cultural Heritage site by the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Committee.,653,much
654,100,1103,"We went to Seoul in June, it was quite hot, I had high expectations about Seoul but so far it was just an average trip that didn't have much attraction. We went to Changdeokgung Palace. I like places with history and story attached to it. I enjoyed the food but didn't love it. I guess enjoying/loving your travel will depend on the places that you go. So maybe next time I will try the outskirts of Seoul.",654,much
655,101,1106,Changdeokgung is a popular tourist spot. Its Secret Garden is hotly sought after in autumn; booking of entry for the Secret Garden of Changdeokgung is via internet (6 days in advance) and all the places will be taken up within an hour or so (booking starting at 10:00 local time). Changdeokgung itself is quite typical but the Secret Garden looks more ancient and has retained much of the original character (despite the re-built). It is a delight to visit the Secret Garden to experience the absolute tranquility and beauty of an ancient garden.,655,much
656,102,1122,"The exterior is not as spacious and grand as Gueongbokgung. However, it's a prettier palace with more trees and a mysterious feel. Go visit the secret garden for a stroll (5000Won per entry) We had a great time enjoying the scenery and breeze inside. There are slopes and much steps at the end of the walk and not suitable for person with walking inconvenience.",656,much
657,103,1129,"It's 3,000W to get in then another 5,000W for the secret garden tour. A nice bunch of buildings but to be honest A LOT of it is inaccessible (you can only look from the outside), there isn't too much in between (the grounds feel sparse), and of course so little of it is original. A huge number of people come here each day so I wouldn't call it peaceful but an ok place to visit if it's the only palace you go to while in Seoul.",657,much
658,104,1132,"I visited on a Wednesday. Contrary to the information in some other reviews, there are many secret garden tours available, including 4 per day in English (this depends on the time of year; see the palace website for full details). Currently, the tours take 200 people instead of the palace website stated 100, this may have been due to Chinese National Day. 50 tickets can be booked ahead and the rest are claimed at the palace. I was able to purchase tickets at 11:15 for the 11:30 tour.  As for the palace itself, very nice and the layout is very different from palaces I've seen before. While some of the layout is perpendicular building and walkway placement, much of it is off at odd angles to meld seamlessly with the natural terrain. This was a nice contrast to the forbidden city in Beijing. The garden tour is definitely worth the time (90 minutes). The tour guide has some useful information and the tour group quickly dwindles to a reasonable size, but you're free to leave the tour guide from the start if you like to do your own thing.",658,much
659,105,1135,"Was expecting more I guess, but the Secret garden is really just a park, not much of a garden. Didn't find it worth the time.",659,much
660,106,1168,"My first time to visit Korea's palace and it was amazing. We took a lot of pictures at the entrance as there was some men who wearing the tradition Korean customs. It was a pity that we didn't spend much time at the palace and wish to try the Korean customs. We also didn't have time to visit the secret garden. For me, I will visit this palace next time.",660,much
661,107,1171,"You need to arrive fairly early if you want to do the secret garden tour after the palace tour. English-speaking guides take the tour around the palace at 10.30am and the secret garden tour kicks off at 11.30am. We turned up a bit late so although we had the palace tour, the garden tour was sold out and we had to wait until 1.30pm for that. Luckily our hotel was very near so we nipped back there as there isn't really another two hours of activity once you have toured the palace. The talk was very good at giving an insight into court life, meaning when we later went to Gyeongbokgung Palace we didn't feel it necessary to join a guided tour. Word of warning to the infirm, the garden tour has some quite steep climbs and quite a lot of older and more overweight vistors found the pace a bit intense, especially in the heat. It's also worth buying the four-palace pass if you intend to visit all the palaces in Seoul. We only did these two, but I'd recommend them both. Gyeongbokgung is much bigger and also contains two fantastic museums. A real must visit.",661,much
662,108,1175,"I enjoyed visiting this gorgeous palace. It has so much architecture and history! The day we went was free entrance and we only had to pay for the English-guided garden tour which lasted an hour. When visiting you can see some Koreans dressed in traditional clothes. It can be very humid and hot so stay hydrated! Also, you can take beautiful pictures so I recommend bringing your best camera. Highly recommended if you are in the area!!!",662,much
663,109,1177,"Changdeokgung Palace is set within a large park in Jongno-gu in Seoul. It is one of the “Five Grand Palaces” built by the kings during the Joseon Dynasty. And as such, it was the principal palace for many of the Joseon kings and a 600-year-old UNESCO World Heritage Site.  We were here for a visit as part of our full day city tour. We arrived at around 9.30am and stayed there for slightly over an hour. It was not crowded when we arrived (perhaps it was still early) and our admission fees had been included in our package tour. But I understand that the admission fee is 3,000 won per adult.  The palace ground was massive, with many ""interlinked"" palace buildings from one to another with a big open compound. Of course what was interesting was the ancient style of architectural design and to some extent, similar to the Chinese style. According to our guide, both ancient China and Korea were good allies and thus the country had some influences from the Chinese culture. (in fact, on the roof top of some buildings were designs of the Chinese classic novel, Journey to the West, with the Monkey God, the Tripitaka Master etc, cool!)  Maintenance and conservation work of the buildings had been done here by the city authorities. So we walked from one building to another, with some being able to enter or taking a look from outside on the interior structure of the palaces, such as the King's chair and office, paintings etc!  Along the way, we also saw some people wearing the traditional Korean Hanbok costumes, very nice, colourful and lovely~ And you are keen, you can try them out too!  As we need to visit several attractions in our tour, we were not able to stay to visit the Secret Gardens which according to our guide, was very beautiful and nice!  For us, the visit here was generally fine and interesting to learn about the ancient culture of Korea though we would love to see more like in Gyeongbukgung Palace. Weather was very sunny and warm and do remember to bring along an umbrella, hat and drinking water.  Well, if you are planning to visit some palaces in your trip here, Changdeokgung Palace is also a good option besides the Gyeongbukgung, though the latter has much more to see, besides the buildings and gardens, bigger, there is also an ancient ""change of guard"" ceremony.  But do take note that the former is closed on Mondays and the latter is closed on Tuesdays!",663,much
664,110,1179,"It is a very charming place, the little lake with white water lily. Well maintained place. You have chance to try their traditional dress for photo as well which was fun. I love the architect of this place very much",664,much
665,111,1183,"You wont need too much time here , just a overall look not more than 30 minutes. This is the most important sign of seoul when you visit . Great place for history lovers. You can also find some tour leaders to receive detailed information.",665,much
666,112,1187,"We spent hours walking around to see where the King lived and where his wife lived, etc.! Beautiful architecture, but no furniture to mention or much else.",666,much
667,113,1188,"This palace is really underrated for its beauty. During my second visit to Korea, I went to Changdeokgung and realised that it was so much more beautiful than Gyeongbukgong. Also, It was much better to take pictures/hanbok photos as it is less crowded. I missed out on the secret garden because of itinerary constraints but I would urge people to visit the garden during their visit because it is magnificent.",667,much
668,114,1194,Overall i find the Palace in Korea a bit too boring.Is all a shell other than that nothing much to see and everything thing looks the same. Is a shame when you look into the room is either empty or pretty dull. You want to see the richness of it during those days.I reacon they cold do much better. Only highlight i got was the delicious cold Citroen Tea you can buy at the giftshop.That was a really nice drink freshly made lemon tea with pieces of preserved lemons. Loved it.,668,much
669,115,1200,"We came here because the other bigger palace was closed on Tuesday. It was okay, nothing too special in my opinion. But the architect was interesting. It's 3000 won entrance fee and you have to pay extra for the secret garden, which I think is what everyone wants to see. It's another 2000 won and you can only go as part of a guided tour. There is not much shade so it's pretty hot on a summer's day.  Bukchon Village and Insadong Street are close by.",669,much
670,116,1222,"This was my favorite palace, and was recommended by a local as theirs as well. It truly blends Korean architecture with nature. The grounds are surrounded with trees and is much prettier than the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Only frustrating part was that you had to pay an additional fee to view the secret garden. It was really nice that they had a snack bar with free wifi and AC, as it was really hot!!!!",670,much
671,117,1224,Went there with my wife and son especially to see secret garden. Gosh!!! What a waste of time. Nothing to see in that garden. Mughal gardens in india are much better. Took free English tour. Felt walking in a normal garden. But totally disappointed. Guide used to show a simple hut with no great architecture and give its history. I got to know that I am doomed when they told that the 1st place we will visit iin the garden is the most beautiful place. A big no from my side.,671,much
672,118,1225,"the palace follows the usual style of these types of buildings, There's not really much to see but the interiors of the buildings have a lot of interesting detail and if you can get a tour guide it makes the visit and understanding the context more enjoyable",672,much
673,119,1226,"I'd recommend this as your first stop in Seoul to get a feel for what Korea has to offer. It will most likely also be all the palaces and temples you will want to see for your whole time in Seoul, which is fair because there's so much more to do in the city. Maybe my expectations were too high, but while I found it was nice to walk around and experience something I don't normally see which is of high historic value, I found it a little underwhelming. Although for such a low price it's definitely worth it.  You're free to walk around by yourself without a tour, plenty of opportunities to take photos, the tour isn't really essential unless you want to learn a lot about the history. The Secret Garden tour is reasonably good and gives you enough information about the palace to keep you satisfied. Even then, you're not really missing out if you don't take a tour, but it's still nice to do. Jongmyo is the only place in the area where you've forced to take a tour 6 days of the week, so if you have limited time I'd recommend not taking any tours here.",673,much
674,120,1237,"This royal palace was much nicer than kyungbok palace. Kyungbok palace was a nice palace but I was much more impressed by this palace. If you have time, You need to visit secret garden of this palace. It's worthy!",674,much
675,121,1250,I loved visiting this palatial complex. The gardens were beautiful and added so much to the complex. The buildings are beautiful.,675,much
676,122,1272,"After visiting Geongbokgung, we think that this palace is a waste of time! Its true that both have their attractions but there are so much more to see in Gyeongbok! We did not go to the Secret Garden, though.",676,much
677,123,1281,a very good friend recommended to visit join a tour in the secret garden . but english tours were fully booked and korean tours were still available. we took the korean tour. didnt appreciate much what the tour guide was saying but i admired what i see. very nice view. nice to have photos taken as well. but going uphill or taking the stairs is very tiring. recommended only to those very athletic one,677,much
678,124,1295,"The only reason I give it 4 stars, is that like many places in Korea they don't give information or notice about how much walking is required or the terrain. I took my parents here and they loved the rich history, the large spaces, but the walking, especially on a hot day in Seoul can be a lot. Make sure to go into the Palace and see the bench where the King would sit. It still smells musty and the old yellow curtains hang low. The best spot is the Secret Garden, but note this is a long walk with many steep hills and climbing.",678,much
679,125,1305,"The strange history concerning how many times it has been destroyed and rebuilt (portions at least) is fascinating. And from far it looks small but as you approach you see the intricate details and great attention that was laid to each element that makes it so beautiful. There were lots of people, but I found that charming. It was good to have a tour guide to tell us about the nuances of the structures and the layout and some of the stories that make a place so much richer. Not good to go on a rainy day. Worth a visit if you have the time - about 1:30-2 hours is good enough. Then it becomes a bit repetitive. If you get a chance walk around the area in the city because there is lots to do there as well, not just sightseeing.",679,much
680,126,1306,"It was a cloudy day when we visited this palace of the last king of Korea. Luckily we managed to join an english tour @2.30pm to find out more about the history of this palace. We didn't join the secret garden tour @3.30pm as it was kinda drizzling and we don't have any umbrella with us today.  The secret garden was where the king spent most of his time together with his most beloved concubine ( whom he couldn't make as his first wife as he wasn't allowed to choose his own wife) He built a house for her next to the garden ( something unheard apparently , showed how much he loved her)",680,much
681,127,1312,Our annual Rotary International convention was held in Seoul Korea this year. We took a few extra days for sightseeing. This Palace was one of the highlights for me. I love history and I love beautiful things. This inexpensive tour combines both of those. I love the way it Korean culture honors its history. This is a beautiful place to visit without spending too many dollars. You can do the whole thing in an hour or two. I also very much enjoyed the museum adjacent to the Palace. Air-conditioned and a nice restaurant inside it was a good diversion in the middle of a hot day. If you can do this with the tour guide it is even better. Too many things that you simply would not understand without having a guide.,681,much
682,128,1325,"I believe you do not need to visit Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace. They are pretty much the same, though the tour we took at Gyeongbokgung Palace was better. The best part of Changdeokgung Palace was The Secret Garden. You can take the tour of The Palace, and then take the tour of The Secret Garden. The Palace tours in English are at 10:30AM & 2:30pm, the Garden is at 11:30, 1:30 & 3:30",682,much
683,129,1336,We took the Secret Garden tour with a knowledgeable English-speaking guide. There are a lot of people who do this tour so I would suggest one to be early as they are punctual. A walk through this Joseon dynasty palatial grounds gives insight into the ways of the Korean royals. The secret garden covers a lot of the palatial grounds with many intricate and unique pavilions and ponds. The setting of these structures was done with much harmony with the landscape. A visit to this palace is absolutely worth it.,683,much
684,130,1362,"I love this palace much more than Cheongbokung Palace. This is more interesting, near secret garden and Hanok Village. It is very easy to go by MRT or Airport Bus limousine.",684,much
685,131,1378,Not a bad place to spend an hour although it lacked much to do once inside. Some good restaurants close by though! Worth a visit if bored.,685,much
686,132,1384,"We had visited the Geongbokgung Palace the last visit and thought we needed to view the Secret Garden and naturally visit Changdeokgung Palace. The palace is rather small and the highlight would the garden.For this you have to go on the website and make a booking. We chose to go on Christmas Day thinking it would be quiet but our group was large, at least 30 (sure reminds of my school trips!). Give yourself half an hour to visit the actual palace itself. I loved the garden as it was huge, sitting in an area much bigger than the palace. It was a hunting ground for the king in the olden days so as to give you an idea how large it was. It is an oasis of calm in the midst of Seoul! However, you can only visit with a guide and therefore cannot enjoy it as much as it should be. I love to sit and watch the world go by so that is not possible. Lovely and well worth a visit.",686,much
687,133,1394,Nice place to see and walk around. Very peaceful and serene. Not much to do here except take in the history,687,much
688,134,1405,"I found Chandeokgung to be the most beautiful of all the palaces--and I visited them all! I took two free English-language tours. The first one--a tour of of the buildings and explanation of the history was very hood. The second tour--of the Secret Garden--was only okay. I could barely understand the guide and the Secret Garden was pleasant--but not as impressive as the name conjured. But I was there just before spring, and I suspect it would have been much prettier with the flowers blooming and the trees leafing out. But the palace was ""WOW!""",688,much
689,135,1406,"This is more Korean style palace. That is, it is built according to the nature. The other one - Gyeongbokgung - is more Chinese style which gates and building are all lined up. Even the main gate for this palace is situated in the corner. And they didn't cut down on hills and trees. So it's pretty much of hiking in the city if you take the full course. The palace part is open to everyone except every Mondays, but the secret garden - something more famous - must be reserved beforehand. If you are a small group, there usually are some tickets available at the spot, but I wouldn't risk it. Just reserve it online first. The garden is beautiful and huge and the hills are haha endless. Better wear sneakers. No tough shoes.",689,much
690,136,1424,"We had been to many similar palace's during our Asia trip, so we only noticed subtle differences. It felt like we were seeing much of the same from what we saw prior in China and Japan. Not taking anything away from the site, it was a great experience and well kept. If you havent seen one of these palace's before and you are in the area, worth the visit.",690,much
691,137,1428,"Seeing the garden is by tour only. We brought tickets for the palace and gardens when we arrived in the afternoon but because of the afternoon garden tour time we didn't get a chance to see the palace. We found the garden disappointing during our visit in late March. There was not much colour. Maybe it looks more attractive at other times of the year? We felt the tour guide did little more than walk us from one photo opportunity to another, and also felt the tour could have been done in half the time.",691,much
692,138,1438,This was an interesting palace but we didn't spend very much time here because we were so short of time. I would like to be able to visit it again.,692,much
693,139,1444,"Love this place. I saw the changing guards and have a chance to take pictures with them. I paid about $5 to get inside. The place has some young men and women dressed in Korea outfit to walk around and stopped for pictures. They are love birds and felt that I was back to the pass and was walking in the palace hundreds of years ago. Not crowded at all, and it was pleasant to walk around. The trees was so nice and the short explore was a much do in Korea.",693,much
694,140,1463,"Had a few hours to kill so I went to the Changdeokgung Palace to walk around. Went on the garden tour which was muddy and not very interesting. The walking areas are sandy dirt, so plan accordingly as your shoes will be a mess when you leave. It had rained/snowed a few days before my visit and the grounds were not in great shape. Worth going, but probably much nicer in spring and summer. I would not pay extra for the garden tour in the winter as there is not much to see.",694,much
695,141,1501,"This Palace is easily reachable by underground or taxi. Most beautiful trees with red leaves mixing other pine trees were all bald at winter time, so it not as colourful as it is in pictures shot in autumn. All buildings were the same and very plain, may interested those architectural lovers. We attempted to pay fee for the secret garden which must be entered with a tour guide but unfortunately one only time with a chinese tour guide on sunday, for the whole day, can you imagine how interested it can be. The palace charge extra money to enter the secret garden but the service is so limited and travellers take so much time to go there. Tour guides in English is also limited. And I did not think I saw any timetable for the secret garden at the main entrance, may be it is a little secret that should not tell travellers. The ticket seller, probably has limited english ability and will just answer the money you need to pay but nothing else. So if you go, it would be better to enquire the tour guide time for the secret garden if you do not want to miss the boat.",695,much
696,142,1503,My husband is Korean. He took me here because he knew of all the palaces this would be my favorite. And it was. It was smaller than the other palaces (but that isn't saying much because this was huge still) I loved it for the natural beauty. It was breath taking. There was a little pond that you would surely miss if you didn't look for it and it was covered in green lily pads. We watched two ducks roam around the waters. This place was a gem in industrial Seoul!,696,much
697,143,1524,This place is full of history. And where a lot of Korea drama are filmed. But not as excited as I thought I would be. It's pretty big but nothing much thou.,697,much
698,144,1542,"I visited Changdeokgung Palace in Dec. and was amazed by the secret garden. Although leaves on the trees are all fallen, the buildings are stills pretty amazing. Tourists are only allowed to go into the garden at certain time with the guided tour. The tour guide was very helpful and really explained the idea behind each building and their layout. Tour is around 1.5hrs and basically hiking up and down the hill, because the garden was built on a small hill. The guide also recommended us to come back in the autumn. The palace will be much more colorful than it is in the winter.",698,much
699,145,1543,"Stunning architecture. English tours available at 1030 and 1430 daily. Adjoins the Changgeongung Palace, which requires a separate ticket to be bought.

Also if you plan to rent an audio-guide, you are required to leave a passport or photo ID.",699,much
700,146,1613,"If you have visited the Gyeonbukgong, then this might not seem much different. However, the secret garden (or known as the rear garden) is a must visit. The scenery is nice with lots of trees and plants, the tour also talks about the history of the palace and garden. The secret garden is only open to guided tours, which need to be booked in advance, and the group can get quite big during peak seasons. There are up and down road/stairs and it's a good 90 minute walk.",700,much
701,147,1619,Nice palace to visit. Loads of walking to do.. Very intricate rooftop designs for the inner palace and the rooms of the king and queen. If I remember correctly. A place that you can take nice photos of Korea.  You could take a walk inside but no need to spend too much time for each visit of the sites.,701,much
702,148,1621,"What a gorgeous and amazing palace! It has been rebuilt, but so have many other places that old. We took the advice of a very helpful woman at a tourist information booth in Itaewon, and took the garden tour. Our guide was amazing! Her English was exceptional, and she had a great sense of humor. We learned so much about the garden and its history. I loved the stories, and the beauty of the gardens and building. It was early fall, so the leaves were changing beautifully. What a lovely way to spend time enjoying and learning!",702,much
703,149,1649,"The timing was hard because we got up early and nothing opens until 9am or later! With Chusok holiday, even more may have been closed. This ""thanksgiving holiday"" is long. In tour books it seems like it's a day and for us it was Sunday but nothing was back open as usual until Wednesday!  We walked to gyeongbokgung palace but it was closed!  The palace doesn't seem as grandiose as the Gyeongbokgung palace but I couldn't believe how much more there was to the grounds. We explored on our first and then waited for an English speaking tour to pass and then hopped on. We had to pass time before our secret garden tour. I ""reserved"" online weeks before but it didn't seem to matter when we got to the ticket booth. They say that half of the tickets are reserved and the other half is on the day of. 11yo lasted through 2/3 of it but it was still worth it. The English speaking tours are later in the morning so we seemed to be waiting around. We should have prepared better and done bukchon village which is close or jongmyo shrine which is also close.",703,much
704,150,1650,"Visited here as part of a multi palace wander of Seoul. This beautiful and serene spot contains ancient Korean palace architecture, well manicured grounds, aquaducts, and much more. You can see the place in under an hour if you hustle, but I would suggest spending a few hours to take in the many great views. This is a coll piece of Korean history and culture which must have been truly spectaculat in the day",704,much
705,151,1659,"Didn't get to see much of the palace because of the Secret Garden tour, but beautiful grounds. Had an English-speaking guide who expalined a lot of the symbolism of the various places where we stopped. A lovely tour.",705,much
706,152,1665,"Gyeonbokgung palace is quite beautiful, and even more than that, it spreads on a huge area and contains a lot of ""rooms"" as part of the palace. It's got a nice history behind, which makes it much more interesting, so try to get some info when you're heading there.",706,much
707,153,1684,"It is best to start your tour of the palaces with this one right here. Crowds are few and tour groups, which are both free and in English, are much smaller. The other palaces you can make do without a tour if you have a guide book, you'll notice lots being repeated in terms of the design of the palaces and structure.  This palace also has a secret garden out back which makes for a pleasant stroll. Note that you are not allowed to wander around the garden by yourself but must go with a tour, you are however allowed to amble around the rest of the palace freely.  It takes a good half day to see everything if you're with a tour. Lots of pagodas, ponds and architecture that must be quite stunning in the fall.",707,much
708,154,1688,"It's a must see in Seoul. However if you come straight after a couple of weeks in Japan (as we did) you cannot help comparing Korean and Japanese temples/shrines and I think Korean ones could have been much improved with a bit of painting, landscape design etc",708,much
709,155,1697,"Went here to see the palace and while it felt a little ""barren"" the architecture was why I enjoyed it. I am a fan of building architecture and yes, some of the building had been burned down and rebuilt, but I wanted to learn about the history of the palace and the signs scattered about allowed me to at least understand a bit about that.  We got the package that allowed us to visit all of the UNESCO sites and, apparently, they throw in the tour of the ""secret"" garden which, well, isn't actually too much of a secret. They also call it the ""rear"" garden which is a much more fitting name. its a large area with some natural pools and very quiet areas. After the first three stopping points it gets a bit hilly so those who are not as ambulatory or are in a wheelchair/use a cane/have problems walking easily on incline surfaces should probably skip the last two stops.  Overall it was a nice place to visit and see the grounds and palace. It is also nearby to Insadong, which is a shopping district (mainly souvenirs) but we strolled there as well afterwards and it was a nice relaxing place to visit.  Overall I'd say at least check it out if you are a fan of history, architecture or both.",709,much
710,156,1699,"One of South Korea's most popular tourist attractions. At the entrance there is a Changing of the Guard, somewhat of a Korean variant on Buckingham Palace, with traditional costumes and music. I believe this place can be crowded at times, but Friday noon it was ok. The park is large with another large garden, the further you will walk into the park, the more quiet it becomes. And that is the moment where you really get to enjoy it. Peaceful relaxation and stunning views into the mountains. I am normally not much of an historician but would like to come back here one day just early in the morning or late in the evening.",710,much
711,157,1700,"In this place, you can really sense the history of Korea. There are many old rooms and a big area to walk. You can see ponds and nature, along with the palaces of course.

Ps: the only way to enter the secret garden is by having a tour ( English or Korean ), unlike most other parts of the place that can be entered with no tour.",711,much

We sat under the pagoda and just sat in peace under the shade from the humid weather . There was a entrance fee which wasn't much but so worth while to see . Would of been better with a English speaking guide to tell you the history of the place but we saw it on our travels and just went in,713,much
714,160,1707,Much much smaller than chines palace but u should know the knowledge that what a tragic history this palace have.,714,much

716,162,1729,"Great place to see live shows, and see a imperial palace. Its really not hard to find, it pretty much near the art district. It should be free if you want to visit the bare perimeter, but if you are thirsty for more info there is a charge.",716,much
717,163,1733,"We went on what was National children's day. It was very crowded and that made it difficult to see most of the exhibit. We did see them practicing for a parade of soldiers, but our guide was not very good at expalining it. The main part of the palace was colorful and the architectural details impeccable. It had been rebuilt after a fire. I actually do not remember much but the crowds.",717,much
718,164,1742,"I find the Changdeokgung Palace complex much more beautiful than Gyeongbokgung Palace, as the former has a lot of beautiful trees and ponds, and different types of buildings, giving visitors a sense of a living space. Gyeongbokgung Palace has just buildings.",718,much

It's claimed to be one of the palace that was most often visited by the emperor due to its beauty. It's a nice, serene place surrounded by greenery, blossoming flowers. Ancient pavilions with chinese poem on it could be found. But it's not too much of a surprise to us. Perhaps we were already awestruck by Gyeongbokgung palace a day earlier =)",720,much
721,167,1755,"Since we are staying in a guesthouse near the palace we went there early as it is very humid that day. The Guided tour in English started at 10:00hrs but we were there by 9:00hrs and we already look around and took photos. This is recommended if you like to focus on the interesting history talks of the tour guide wearing Traditional Korean Hanbok while showing you around the palace. It will take an hour till your next tour to the Secret Garden. That's why you don't have time to take much photos because there's a lot of places you will be visiting with the group (in fast pace) then next going uphill to the garden. You must wear running shoes, enough sunblock, insect repellent, water and eye shades as you are going to do some hiking. We visited the area during summer (June 2015). The tour in the secret garden and the admission fee are separate purchase at the ticket booth. But since you are already there, you might be up to doing some adventure while discovering the King's hide out when he needs to be alone and relax. Definitely a must visit!",721,much
722,168,1766,This is definitely one of the most beautiful places in Seoul. The carefully curved and colorfully decorated buildings look really marvelous. When walking along I had a chance to admire the old builders' effort. That gave me the chance to imagine how much the Koreans respected the emperor's authority. The buildings are perfectly set inside the peaceful park. This is very Asian style which philosophy is to cooperate not interfere with nature. Walking along the gardens was a very relaxing experience for me after the hustle and bustle of contemporary Seoul. To sum up this place is one of Your must see list when in Korea.,722,much
723,169,1771,"Changdeokgung Palace is not all that different from Deoksegung (Toksegung) or Duksoo Palace or even Kyongbokkung (Gyeongbukgung) Palace (minus the National Palace Museum) except for the Piwon (Biwon), the Secret Garden that's really more of a large wood and that makes a visit to Changdeokgung really worthwhile. But note that the Piwon is only open to guided tours that are alternatively in Korean, Japanese and English, so make sure to check the schedule and get there early because the tour of the Piwon is very popular. Also, be prepared for a long walk uphill and downhill through the Secret Garden, which must be as large as the gardens at Versailles but is much more rugged terrain. There's a fee for the Secret Garden, but it's only about $5 and it's worth it. I went with a friend on a very hot day in July and it was exhausting but worthwhile. The gift shop has a little cafe and is air conditioned; they also have expensive but nice souvenirs as well as wi-fi (the only place on the grounds of the palace with wi-fi). When you leave, walk out the main gate to the right and walk just a few blocks and you'll be in Bukchon Village, which is also really worthwhile; it's also a good place to eat lunch or dinner.",723,much
724,170,1774,"We visited the palace with our kids and spent an hour on the English speaking tour. Out tour guide was very good, although she reminded me a little too much of JuDee (tour guide from the Avatar cartoons). Beatiful grounds and. Interesting history made this a very worth while location.",724,much
725,171,1776,"I wouldn't call this a must see, but I must say that I really enjoyed it despite the biting cold. One thing I love about Seoul's historical attractions is that they include free English tours, you just have to make sure you have the times right and that you are on time. Unfortunately I missed the last secret garden tour, which is said the be the highlight. Nevertheless, I found the tour to be fun, interesting, and very informative. Really, don't miss the tour, it is 70% of the experience. I found it more interesting than the main palace, Gyeongbukgong, equally beautiful, and much less crowded.",725,much
726,172,1781,We were able to catch the english tour which was so much more informative and interestinf then just walking around by yourself. I found this palace to be much more beautiful and scenic although the buildings itself were much smaller as the gardens and trees were more elaborate then the other palaces. Free admission for the month of july!,726,much
727,173,1787,"A nice palace with the usual decorated roofs, and pleasing complexes of interconnected buildings. The secret garden was fine, but not especially beautiful, and a long organised walk in a large group is not the best way to enjoy it. Maybe at just the right cherry moment it would be worth it (I was a week and a storm or two too late), but otherwise don't worry too much if you miss it.",727,much
728,174,1812,"We visited this palace because it seems to be the prettier palace of Seoul. It is a large area that would require much walking. Luckily, the palace is beautiful and has a distinctive style so it is easy to explore. If you visit, do spare time to join the back garden tour. I'd say the back garden is the prettiest of the place and I understand why it is open only by tours for preservation.",728,much
729,175,1833,"In case you are a business traveller, and have very little time to see through the rich Korean history in Seoul, this place (Changdoekgung) along with the other one in heart of city (Gyeongbukgung) would be an ideal place for an afternoon short trip - it's well possible to squeeze any of these palaces between your morning meetings and evening drinking sessions...  Changdeokgung is the only UNESCO World Heritage site out of the Five Grand Palaces built by Joseon dynasty which ruled Korea. Magnificent piece of authentic ancient Korean architecture.  There are many tour operators who offers a package of Changdoekgung with night markets etc., but you will need to enquire first whether they will take you into the 'Secret Garden'... you SHOULD NOT miss it. I booked with an operator, and upon learning that they will only provide entry to the palace and not the 'Secret Garden', I decided to abandon the tour midway and be on my own.  The palace and 'Secret Garden' tickets are sold separately, and 'Secret Garden' is opened to a batch of tourists with a Palace guide guiding you on the trail once every 15-30 mins. So, you may have to get in there, and plan for a secret garden ticket with a slot an hour at least from when you reach (sometimes there is quite a rush, and number of tickets per slot is limited to a maximum 30 ish). I spent the hour seeing the palace, and then went for the Secret Garden tour, which is technically 70% of the palace area.  It was worth a wait. Lush-green tree-rows with beautifully crafted lake-houses .... the flora was just amazing. ... I wonder if I liked the whole trail so much in summer, how good it will be during the spring season..  The only flip-side which I will regret - taking a Korean tour of 'Secret Garden' [every slot of Secret Garden tour is in a specific language and only few were in English] since the next English tour available was still couple of hours more of wait. so couldn't make much out of the context. But hey.. you always have a Wikipedia, it's the visual and other sensory experiences that matter...",729,much
730,176,1848,"With Huwon (Secret Garden) at the back, this is a great Palace to explore. If only the bridge to Jungmyo was still there, it would be even better. This Palace has lots of history than Gyeongbukgong. if I remembered correctly from the guided tour. And the story about the last Prince (or was it King?), who rebuilt a quarter especially for his lover, was so romantic. If you are not travelling with kids, I really recommend that you have to follow the guided tour as the guide knows so much.",730,much
731,177,1850,"In my opinion, this palace is much more worth visiting compared to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The minute I stepped onto the palace ground, the palace seems to reach out to you, eager to share its history with you. The palace is of a considerable size and you need to take your time to appreciate each and every building. As the halls and living quarters are built apart from each other, every time I looked into a hall or a living quarter, I try to imagine how life was like for a royalty back in the Joseon period. It would be great if you can hire a guide or get an audio guide to help better understand the rich history of the palace. As I went to the palace after mid-noon, we missed the guided tour to the Secret Garden located just beside the palace. Make sure you check the timing for the English tour and head down early to book a spot. I really enjoyed this palace and since I didn't get to visit the Secret Garden, I definitely have a valid reason to revisit again!",731,much
732,178,1851,"If you have the time, it is good to visit this place. But if you have visited china and Beijing, specially Forbidden City, this place will not excite you much. But it is good to visit and find out the difference between chines and Korean culture.",732,much
733,179,1863,"Went in with the free English guided tour. I think this is a must for them to explained the history, culture and the meanings. Probably in general it is the same for the others palaces as well -- Gyeongbukgung, Deoksukgung. The only difference will be in the details. The secret garden is ok but truly a very long walk and especially not for those too tired after visiting other areas in Seoul. Its a series of walk up and down small hills. And I have visited much more beautiful gardens in Kyoto.",733,much
734,180,1866,"So cheap to get in and we loved the guided tour of the Secret Garden. So much to see and explore. Not only foreigners, but there were also plenty of locals exploring the palace, which was a delight to see (since some even wore Hanbok). The area surrounding the palace also had some hanuks and local artisan shops you can explore.",734,much
735,181,1869,"If you've ever been to Kyoto or Beijing, this palace might not do much for you.  If you've never seen a place like this in Asia, I suppose it would be quite impressive.  The gardens are well maintained and it was clean.  Lots of obnoxious high schoolers running around unsupervised, making noise, etc.  If you're in Seoul you should go, but compared to some of the other places in Asia I have been, it wasn't that great.  Just my opinion.",735,much
736,182,1895,"I went to Gyeongbokgung palace before going to this palace, and boy, what a difference. Changdeokgung is beautiful, has much more English information, and the Secret Garden is amazing. I was especially amazed by the ancient trees and the different styles of the buildings. Too bad there was no audio guide!",736,much
737,183,1899,The palace grounds are much smaller and more intimate than Gyeongbokgung Palace - and definitely not as crowded. We took a guided tour of The Secret Garden but in the pouring rain which made it a little difficult to enjoy the scenery. Still worth the time and money to see - a nice contrast from the bigger palace.,737,much
738,184,1903,"I did the Secret Garden tour. The tour guide was rude to me and did not attempt to control our group. There was a very loud family with our group and at times would drown out our tour guide's voice. Some of us on the tour wanted to hear the history of the palace, but could not because of the constant talking and noise from this large family.  I went in the spring, so probably not as lovely as the summer. The trees were bare and not much green foliage.",738,much

It was part of the Seoul Culture Tour - a free 5 hour tour (10 am to 3 pm) provided by the airport for passengers on long layovers. It was very cold - 10 Celsius, and the Airport even provided free down parkas. The Palace is well preserved. It was educational and picturesque. We learned a lot about Korean history and culture and very much enjoyed this introduction Korea. Per our guide the best time to visit South Korea is March and April. Winter is cold and summer is hot and muggy.",742,much
743,189,1943,"If you have never been to China and visited the palaces around the Forbidden City, then this will be a good experience of an Asian palace. if you have visited Beijing and toured even the palaces of the princes, then you can skip this.  It's much smaller than I thought and may be it had to do with the Korean history, but the palace seems to be pretty basic. Like a poor man's version of the Forbidden City.",743,much
744,190,1949,I decided to visit the palace as I had never seen something like this before. There was a relatively cheap entrance fee and there were not many people so the trip was very slow paced and relaxing. The grounds are quite large so give yourself about 2 hours to see it properly and read the information boards along the way which explain the historical significance of the palace. There are many buildings to see and appreciate the architecture of the time. There are guards at the front gate wearing traditional costume with whom you can take some photos with if you wish. I enjoyed it very much.,744,much
745,191,1953,"Nice place to go visit. Went on a weekday. Much better, as little traffic. It was a cold day, so i rushed through it. Don't expect to see a palace like those of Turkey and England. Its very much outdoor based.",745,much
746,192,1957,We visited here on a tour and really enjoyed the site. It speaks to the history of Korea. I suspect that if it was raining we would not have enjoyed it as much as we walked on a lot of sand that I guess would turn into mud when it rains.,746,much

A dream come true to me that my hubby bring me to Korea last November until the first week of December as an anniversary gift. Although the weather that time is so cold, we explore the expansive area as much as we could. I really fell in love to the place and thinking back in times how they live their day to day life in this very large area. Of course, don't forget your cameras for your photo ops as a proof that you visited the area. There's a coffee shop near the entrance if you want to relax first after your exploration.",747,much
748,194,2012,Many Things were built by wood and due to many wars and fires there are not many historical places ( such as palaces and grand religious places like in Europe ) and I believe this place is the best that you can get in Korea.

There are two kinds of tickets, one is for Changdeokgung Palace only (3,000 won) & the other is Changdeokgung Palace + Secret Garden (8,000 won with tour guide). We made ticket reservation on its website 1-week before the trip, all Chinese & English speaking tour guides were fully booked, we Chinese only had to book a ""Japanese"" speaking tour guide at 12:30 pm. If you want to know every place of its history, it is highly recommended to make the reservation on its official website as early as possible for a understandable language. No advance payment is required.  Upon arrival at the Secret Garden, we were a bit disappointed because it's too early for the beautiful Autumn leaves at the end of October, not much were seen. However, the weather is nice and comfortable, it took us 2.5 - 3 hours to walk, take pictures and enjoy the environment (without following the Japanese tour guide). It is a nice & relaxing place to visit. We may learn more of Its history on its official website or UNESCO's.",749,much

751,197,2047,"We arrived and realized that we had visited 6 years earlier. We paid the entry fee and went in anyway. We had the same impression that we had on our prior visit. It is impressive, but it is stark and bare, leaving too much to our limited imaginations. The last time that we visited we took a tour in English and paid the extra fee for the Secret Garden, only accessible by tour. Both were well worth the fees and time spent. This is a UNESCO World Heritage site and while we would never want it turned into a Disney version of a palace, it would be great to see an exhibit (drawings, models, film) of what all of these buildings were used for and what they may have looked like when the palace was inhabited. Next to the Secret Garden entrance was an entrance to another palace, the Changoyeonggung Palace. It was only about $1 each and it turned out to be the highlight of our day. I understand an additional fee for the Secret Garden, but would have preferred that the visit was not limited to a guided tour. I also would have liked that a brochure be offered with the entry fee or for an additional charge. There were a few plaques in English throughout, but more information and history would have been a great addition.",751,much
752,198,2049,"Changedeokgung is a beautiful palace albeit much smaller than Gyeongbukgung. It was not too crowded when we visited on a Tuesday. We bought combination tickets for $10k Won each which allows one to visit the various palaces in Seoul as well as the Jongmyo Shrine. This includes the Secret Garden too. If you plan on visiting at least 2 of these attractions, it is worth buying the combination tickets. We arrived early and were able to join the first English speaking tour for the morning. It is good to join the tour (free) as the guide will provide commentaries and information as well as historical background to the many buildings / rooms within the palace grounds. We particularly enjoyed the little snippets the guide shared with us regarding the daily lifestyle & stories of the Kings & Queens who lived there. The tour last about an hour and it ends near the entrance to the Secret Garden. This was very well planned as we could immediately make our way to the next guided tour to the Secret Garden scheduled at 1130am.

If you're taking the city tour, the other one is stop #22 and this is #23. Take 23. It's a much larger palace with a secret garden. .secret garden is a different fee to get in and I didn't go there but I've read that it's one of the main attractions not to be missed. This palace (grounds) is much larger with beautiful architecture.",754,much
755,201,2070,"I had pre-booked my Huwon (Secret Garden) Tour online and I would recommend visitors to do so. Although you will still have to queue to retrieve your tickets, at least you are guaranteed for the tour, in your preferred language (and you will be aware of the relevant time slots too). The land area is massive and there is much to explore in Changdeokgung Palace even without the Huwon; however, I reckon one might get bored easily without a guide. One positive thing to note is that due to its size, I didn't feel that it was too crowded although there were many visitors (even local groups bringing their children along for study trips).  The Huwon tour though is definitely my highlight to Changdeokgung Palace. The Huwon harmonises with its natural terrains as its pavilions and gardens are built on slopes and around its large hills. Hence, most of these beauties are hidden from sight, if you are not following the tour. On the other hand, the route may be difficult as there is some hiking involved (just a tough on the elderly) and the tour would be almost impossible for those bound on wheelchair as maneuvering around it gets really tricky. Be prepared, with a good pair of walking shoes.",755,much

Too much dust and open space, some pleasant vistas but the backdrop of hi-rise is a real annoyance. Very tricky to get real quality photos here. I had to focus on close-ups. Very average for the price....",756,much
757,203,2099,"The palace is a very nice place, and with much less people than the major palace in Seoul. Some of the buildings and gates are original and dating from early 15 century. 1 hour to 90 min should be ok for a good visit.

759,205,2116,I visited the palace on a weekday and found that it was much less crowded than the Gyeongbokgung Palace which was nice since this allowed for time to stroll around and take pictures. The whole complex was very beautiful and it was really interesting to see the original-type architecture of Seoul. I didn't do the Secret Garden tour but found that I really enjoyed the palace regardless. Definitely worth the admission price and there are brochures and information boards throughout so you get an understanding of which buildings were used for different purposes.,759,much

I have been inside the Deoksugung Palace which is closest to the town center, Changdeokgung is much bigger and with an English tourist guide (scheduled), I had a better appreciation of the history of the palace i.e the history of rooms, space, engravings etc. My group wanted to have our own free walk in the Secret Garden because we were short of time but we were not allowed too – seems that visitors have to follow the guide once inside the garden. It is quite huge, to make sure the queen was not bored or/and having a feeling of melancholy being forbidden to step outside of the palace. Almost like being outside, it’d be more beautiful in the fall or winter.",760,much

I was looking forward to the tour with great anticipation, as it is only offered to foreigners six nights a year, with a limit of 100 tickets per night. I made a special point to be online and order tickets the minute they went on sale, that's how much I wanted to take this tour.  The tour was offered in English, Chinese, and Japanese, and attendees were divided into groups accordingly. That part was good. I expected the pathways, buildings and garden to be illuminated (not brightly so as to recreate daytime, but at least so that we could see what we were being shown) but sadly, this was not the case. A small number of attendees were asked to carry paper lanterns as we walked the grounds, and there were a few lights on the buildings, but I couldn't really see much. The pathways were unlit (the few paper lanterns scattered about were ineffective), and the ground is quite uneven, with random obstacles on the path (something which looked like pipe vents, at one point there was something that looked like an empty concrete pond, completely unlit, which someone could easily have tripped into), and we were marched from building to building very quickly. There was a lot of hiking up stairs and then down stairs, all stone, all uneven, all unlit. What could have been a pleasant walking tour felt more like a march in the dark. We were ""treated"" to a tour of the rear ""secret"" garden but were unable to see anything - I mean absolutely nothing. So what was the point of taking us through the garden? I'm still not sure.  When we reached the pavilion at the end of the garden, there was one building which was beautifully lit, with a large (unlit) pond in front of it. A musician played a traditional Korean gayageum, and we got to sit and listen for about 10 minutes. This part of the tour was quite lovely.  Tea and traditional Korean sweets were part of the tour, but the tea was served in paper cups - take one as you walk past a table, and keep moving - and the sweets were handed to you in a (very nice) fabric bag. I didn't expect a formal tea ceremony, but I also didn't expect a paper cup. This was just one more disappointment.  From there we sat as an audience in front of a stage area, where we were treated to another lovely musical performance consisting of several different types of performances. This was the highlight of the tour. If this had not been included, my rating would have been ""poor"" rather than ""average."" After that, we had to walk about 15 minutes back to the entrance, with no guidance, minimal lighting, and, once again, hidden obstacles.  Cost: 30,000 won per person. I would not recommend it. Go in the daytime, walk at your own pace, and you will undoubtedly get much more enjoyment for much less money.",761,much
762,208,2129,Look I have to start with a disclaimer and say that old palaces and the like tend not to be too much of my thing. That said I did enjoy the trip here and really do recommend taking the time to make your way here if you are in Seoul. The guides are really very knowledgeable and the gardens within the grounds of the palace are well worth checking out. If not for any other reason that you are in a busy and bustling city yet are in what is really a quite secluded and serene garden and nature walk. I suppose it is the juxtaposition that is most striking about it.,762,much
763,209,2130,"Its a beautiful palace with a huge amount of grounds and wasn't overly crowded. I have to say despite its beauty I did find it a little bit samey in design/architecture without much variation from the style. Its worth a visit, and get a guide if you can because its very thorough and informative. Takes about 1-2 hours to look around. There is access to the 'secret garden' but it costs more so we didn't go. Try and go when its sunny as the colours on the buildings are better! Near to Insadong and other palaces/temples. This is easy to find (its huge) and is about 10-15 minutes away from various metro stations.",763,much
764,210,2155,"The palace itself is interesting, but lack of any identification of what the buildings were or their significance to the historical period has you looking at a lot of buildings that all look very similar. Once you've seen one or two, you've seen them all. The Secret Garden is also interesting, but it too has many of the same structures without much difference in their historical value. It was interesting but not worth 90 minutes. Guided tour is large group with single guide, you can easily miss our out the naration.",764,much
765,211,2161,"Excellent, very much worth a visit, if you are interested in Korea's ancient history. Ground can be a bit uneven so watch your step, very good.",765,much
766,212,2190,"This is my second palace tour in Seoul and while the throne hall is not as ""grand"" as the one in Gyeongbokgung Palace, it has its own charm and I love it!.  The palace is not that crowded or maybe our guide simply took us on places that were not part of the official tour given by this place. I'm glad I signed up for this free tour and because it's a small group, we get much better chance to ask more questions and stray away from the usual pack of tourists roaming around. I love the fact that some areas are really quiet where you can simply sit down on an open balcony and admire the beauty of its surroundings.  The structures of this palace is great and true to its description, it follows the natural topography of the site instead of imposing themselves upon it. I also love the short hike on the natural garden at the back of the palace.",766,much
767,213,2191,"This palace is much more beautiful than it's big brother to the east. Changdeokgung has a more cobbled together feel, and somehow a more Korean feel than the large rectangular layout of Gyeongbokgung. The gardens are a highlight. Try to get on a tour of the back garden if you can, but if you miss the slot just wandering around the palace grounds is a treat. Especially good in spring and autumn.",767,much
768,214,2194,whow -really impressive and perfectly restored- it is a most if you really want to enjoy all of it -take ample of time and idepending on your taste a tour guide or at least a good guide book -so much to learn and to discover,768,much
769,215,2206,"TICKETS - buy a group ticket for all 5 temples for 10,000 won instead of separate to save money  Beautiful Temple, very similar to Gyeonbokgung and Changgyeonggung - if you are interested in Temples then its a must see, if you are all templed out and dont have time then skip this and see the main Temple (Gyeonbokgung) its much more touristy - they also have changing of the guards here which is pretty cool to see",769,much
770,216,2211,"I joined the Secret garden tour as I missed the free tour. The secret garden was great and the tour guide was great. But I believe it would be much more interesting to listen to stories for the palace rather than the garden. Nevertheless, the tour and palace is worth seeing.",770,much
771,217,2213,"Changdeokgung Palace is a charming historical place that should be on everyone's Seoul itinerary. While Gyeongbokgung Palace is the more popular and larger attraction, Changdeokgung offers a more personal and intimate experience because of its smaller (but still expansive) compound and the lovely Secret Garden. There are two guided tours here - the outer main buildings and the Secret Garden. I highly recommend both. With so much history and information to absorb, it would be an injustice to the place if you walk around on your own. The Secret Garden, by the way, can only be accessed via the official guided tour. Our tour guides on both tours were outstanding and spoke excellent English. Their knowledge was, of course, extraordinary, but they also made great effort to talk clearly and slowly. The buildings of the palace were most interesting to me.This palace as I understand it was mainly for living more than ceremonies. It was fascinating to see living quarters of royalty as well as those that served it. Spanning centuries, the palace remained in use until the last century. The tours took us not only through the buildings, but indeed through time. The Secret Garden was fun but busy with scores of people joining the tour. While hearing the tour guide commentary was difficult at times, we did get the chance to see some striking pavilions by pools and walk along tree-lined paths that really made my day. Anecdotes and tidbits delivered by the guide enhanced a really good visit.",771,much
772,218,2216,We spent about four hours at this palace. The secret garden is beautiful but not for people unable to walk distances or climb stairs. We enjoyed our visit very much. It was the first palace we visited on our trip.,772,much
773,219,2218,"We were disappointed. Although this site is nicely preserved, there wasn't much to see. There was an extra entrance fee for the secret garden, which according to the guide books was the gem of this site. We didn't go in unfortunately. Strollers? Impossible to lug up the huge stone steps in front of every building. Families with young children need to be better prepared than we were.",773,much
774,220,2222,"It is easy to find fault with the Palace but that would be missing the point. The site is readily accessible, good value, and interesting in its context. We were not on a tour and found taking our time to wander where we liked a more relaxing approach and signage was adequate. Restoration and reconstruction efforts have resulted in an historical 'oasis' amongst the hustle and bustle of modern Korea. For certain, it would be nice to walk around inside the buildings and see fully furnished interiors but that is unrealistic for large numbers of visitors, the wear and tear would be too much. We found it interesting to discuss the similarities and differences with other Asian palaces we have visited. The setting and the landscape both contribute to the experience.",774,much
775,221,2238,"Go early, really. Plus the 'audio guide shop' was 'sold out' within the first hour we arrived! Until we asked a Korean lady who still managed to get them - the guides are actually available NEXT to the bureau de change! Plus you are required to place your passport with them as a deposit - But they do double check before returning the passports to you which is assuring. The place - just average for me - nothing much to see and gardens were just okay.",775,much
776,222,2247,This palace is an easy walk from Anguk station on the orange line. Adult admission for the english language palace tour + secret garden tour was around 18000 won. There is an english brochure for 500 won. We took the 10:30 am palace tour followed by the 11:30 garden tour. The garden tour was 1.5 hours long. You can tour the palace on your own but to see the gardens you must be with a guide.  The guides wear traditional hanboks and both of my guides spoke good english. The palace tour is interesting and there was enough information without being overloaded with trivia. The garden tour however was more about the scenery. The lady talked about the functions of the different areas of the gardens but it wasn't very compelling. Also it was more enjoyable to not be in the throng of 50 people that were on the tour and to straggle behind.  I found this palace more interesting than Gyeongbokgung and it is much larger than Deoksugung.,776,much
777,223,2248,"How to get there: Anguk Station, Exit 3  We toured Changdeokgung last April 15. Our tour guide informed us that unlike the Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung is more of authentic Korea-style palace. Inside Changdeokgung are another attractions which are the Secret Garden and Huwon, wherein you will pay for another entrance fee.  Entrance fee for the Changdeokgung is KRW 3,000. But with the Integrated Royal palaces (IRP) Ticket for KRW 10,000, you may visit Seoul's 4 palaces and Jongmyo shrine as much as you want for a month.",777,much
778,224,2253,"Changdeokgung Palace is much more tranquil than the other two major palaces of Seoul. It is surrounded by lush gardens and greenery, which even in the winter’s snow can make Changdeokgung look remarkably picturesque, rivalling perhaps even the wintery sight of the incredible Ginkaku-Ji temple in Kyoyo, Japan.  The main garden here is called Huwon which is 78 acres of amazing tranquil greenery. Depending on the season, you can see snow, autumnal leaves or possible some cherry blossoms.  Changdeokgung is the longest-serving royal palace in Seoul, and this made me want to visit it to see what the fuss was about. I enjoyed an hour or so looking at the intricate architecture, but to the untrained eye you must remember that a lot of these palaces and buildings within them all look very similar, so unless you have a particular interest in Joseon Dynasty era palaces, then I think you should prioritise your palaces, and thus I must recommend Gyeongbokgung.",778,much
779,225,2254,"Our first palace visit in Seoul was Gyeongbokgung. That was a great introduction to the Joseon dynasty, and our visit to Changdeokgung added to that experience. The history of this palace is covered extensively elsewhere, and all the practical information required is in the excellent KTO page http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_1_1_1.jsp?cid=264348  We bought an Integrated Ticket of Palaces which covers Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Deoksugung, Gyeongbokgung and Jongmyo Shrine. This was excellent value at 10,000 won.  This time we managed to join an English speaking tour, and we learned so much about life in the royal palaces in that era. As with Gyeongbokgung, there are seats dotted around, so you can bring a picnic or rest your weary feet.  The English tours to the palace are at 10:30am and 14:30, and the English tours to the Secret Garden are at 11:30 and 15:30. We started with the 10:30 palace tour followed immediately by the 11:30 garden tour, and this proved exhausting, especially for my parents who are in their 70s. If time permits, my advice would be to have a break in between the tours by heading to nearby Insadong or Bukchon, with its art galleries, independent craft shops, cafes and restaurants.  You could even consider returning on another day for the Secret Garden. On no account should you join in another language group for the garden tour, as visitors all have to stick together and you are not permitted to wander off on your own. You will be stuck for 90 minutes with a guide speaking in a language you do not understand.  Take this visit at a leisurely pace. This is Seoul at its historical and cultural best and it would be a shame to factor in Changdeokgung as simply one more thing to cross off your Seoul 'to do' list.",779,much
780,226,2257,"While most of these palaces look pretty much the same for the untrained eye, I can recommand the Moonlight tour at this palace. Nice lighting, enjoyable performances and a great tour guide. Have a look a the Korea tourism website to see if one is available when you visit / depends on whether there is a full moon or not.",780,much
781,227,2258,We visited on a free-admission day to the Palace and paid for the Secret Garden tour. The Secret garden trees were mostly bare in March.There is nothing of much interest if you compare this to the other grand gardens of the East or West.The guide(in English) for the palace was pleasant but the guide for the Secret Garden was a bit snotty and it is a long long walk so beware,781,much
782,228,2261,"I went on the Secret Garden tour with my mum after we had looked around the palace (book in advance for the tour). It was quite long but very informative and good to get away from the palace crowds for a bit. It really didn't feel like you're in the middle of a cosmopolitan city when you're standing in a pavillion next to a pond. Really beautiful. Just wish that there was more to see in the buildings as, apart from the throne room, everything is pretty much empty.",782,much
783,229,2290,we visited in November so it was very quiet which despite the cold was actually very nice and peaceful as it felt like we were the only group around! we bought the combination ticket which allows entry into several palaces including the famous secret garden in this palace.  I would definitely recommend to book a tour of your language of choice as this makes the walk around much more interesting instead of walking around an empty palace! The tour guide was very informative and spoke great english.  I enjoyed the secret garden the most and it is possible to get some beautiful shots here! we managed to even catch some autumn red leaves!  if travelling in the winter do make sure to wear comfortable shoes and wrap up! the palace ground tour lasts for 1hour and then the secret garden tour for 90 minutes.,783,much
784,230,2291,Visited Gyeongbukgung back in 2006 and thought we should visit this palace as well since Changdeokgung is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. But I didn't see much difference between both palaces (building and the grounds). Didn't get to visit the garden as we missed the last English tour which is at 2.30pm. Probably we should have come during other seasons as the palace looks bleak and melting snow was dripping from the roof during winter.,784,much
785,231,2293,"This is one of favorite palaces in Seoul. The garden and pond area are a must-see! Unfortunately, when we visited the pond was under maintenance and was drained. This was very disappointing but the palaces and garden area was still very beautiful. I would definitely recommend a tour because the grounds are beautiful on their own but the stories make it so much more interesting. There is quite a bit of walking but it is mostly flat so I found it fine to wear sandals but be prepared to walk a lot.",785,much
786,232,2304,"I went to all three palaces and this was def the nicest. It is remodeled and seems to have some sort of structure. I wish I took a tour as I don't know much about what I was looking at. There are small signs here and there, and large signs with lots and lots of info. I also wish I was able to book a secret garden tour which was not available to be day of because it seemed all the tour groups had booked it. Nearby is a children's museum which was fun for me. If you're short on time, don't bother with the other palaces. It is the most expensive one, but the best. Also nearby is Bukchon Village (traditional Korean village) and to the other side the Modern Art Museum.",786,much

The english tours at all of them are 11 1 and 3 with changing of the guard on the hour. I would definitely take the tour so you know what your looking at. An added benefit to this palace is out the back gate is the blue house (the presidents house). As you can see a visit to this area of Seoul offers so much.",789,much

Be sure to catch the free English tour for a better appreciation of the palace, the history of Korea, and the lives of the royal family.  Within the Changdeokgung is the Secret Garden (separate fee; with tour guide), which for me was overrated, and can be skipped as there is not much to see.

Changdeokgung has a 'secret garden' but don't expect too much, it's really more of a small forest with some forgettable pagodas scattered around. It's pretty, but not a must-see. If you've only got time for one palace, choose Gyeongbokgung.

The admission fee is 3,000 KRW, and if you would like to visit the secret gardens, that is an additional 2,000 KRW (please check their website as I did not choose the secret garden option).  If you have made it to the Changdeokgung Palace, do not miss walking through the Bukchon area (next to the palace). Go to the information counter to get a Bukchon map.

The secret garden is also here but requires another entrance fee, so we didn't see it. I heard it's really beautiful inside.

I think, if times allow, it is better you join this tour because it is a waste to only look at this beautiful buildings without knowing the story behind it. But, if you too concern about your time (ya, there is a lot to do in Seoul in 1 day), you can skip this.  Just after I finished the Palace Tour, I continue with the Secret Garden Tour. It will cost you KRW 5,000. I have to warned you, it is not and easy tour, because you will hike up a small hill, do a lot of walking here. A good and comfy shoe will help you a lot. But do not worry so much because the guide is good enough to arrange sufficient stop for you to catch your breath. On top of that, if you are not able to finished your tour, just let her know, and she will point you the nearest exit to you. Just for you to know, this Secret Garden is not actually a garden, it is more to a forest behind the palace. So, if visiting a beautiful forest is not your thing, don't go.

Entrance fee to the garden must be combined with the palace tour- very cheap at 9,000 won. We went much earlier than our 1130AM guided tour to the Garden. Presented our reservation confirmation form to the cashier, paid the fee and went around this beautifully-preserved Palace. Unlike our last year's rain-filled visit, the weather this time was sunny yet cool. 5 minutes after 1130, our big group was herded to the Garden. It was enchanting.

Arrived around 1pm and spent about an hour here following the numbering of the buildings in the provided brochure. Ticket costs KRW3000 (~USD2.70) with an additional fee to visit Huwon. If one is keen to see this ""Secret Garden"" then advanced booking is best. It seems the regular ticket will allow one to see many structures in this palace complex, but cover less than half of the area (Huwon is rather large).  The brochure which came with the ticket is an excellent one and quite sufficient for navigating through the complex, with rather substantial information for identifying unique features of the buildings and understanding the architecture. Changdeokgung minus Huwon seems much smaller than Gyeongbokgung and takes a shorter time to visit. However after seeing much in Gyeongbokgung, this required a bit more effort to appreciate. Also, worth noting is that the crowds seemed unavoidable here, probably due to the small size of Changdeokgung, the fact that it was visited later in the day and on a weekend.  Thought the blue tiled roof of Seonjeongjeon was rather unique, but personally found the Nakseonjae Complex stood out the most because of its simplicity, reflecting the character of the King who lived here.  Overall, a very good visit to Changdeokgung, and a worthy inclusion to exploring Seoul. Note that this palace is closed on Mondays. Also there is a month-valid combination ticket to visit the other three palaces and Jongmyo shrine nearby. These are all within walking distance but would be rather difficult to properly appreciate in one full day.  If coming by metro, Changdeokgung is accessible by Line 3 (Anguk station) Exit 3.",817,much
818,264,2569,"Occasionally organizers plan a moonlight tour of this palace. The palace itself is wonderful and even if its not the night tour you will still enjoy your time. If you have the chance to do the moonlight tour, even though it is much more expensive (30,000 won) it is totally worth it. They tour you around the grounds and at the end there is an amazing performance of traditional Korean music, dance, and singing.",818,much
819,265,2570,"Must be the size of the place. It's much smaller compared to Gyeongbokgung. And you definitely must try and fit in for a guided tour. Otherwise, it is boring by just looking at the structure of the buildings which are similar to the ones in the other palaces without the storyline.",819,much
820,266,2597,The one thing that I wanted to visit whilst in Korea were the palaces as it brings so much history to the city. I wasnt disappointed when we went to visit and we managed to see the Changing of the guards too.,820,much
821,267,2600,"For somewhat who is interested in East Asia history, one must visit this palace. There is a very real difference between Chinese and Korean royal buildings. Korea's last dynasty Joseon, was Confucian in principle and practice, and I might add far more Confucian than later dynasties in China (where Confucianism originated).  This difference is apparrent in palace architecture and royal tombs. While the Forbidden City Palace is perhaps the most grand palace in the world, Changdeokgung is rather simple, not in a bad way. This is by design. Moreover, while Chinese tombs were designed often as monumental structures by the Emperor destined to abide there, in Korea the view was different.  Joseon strictly adhered to Confucian princliples, which are very concerned with humility, filial devotion, and the dignity of simplicty. Therefore, concerning palace and tomb architecture it was ideal to construct buildings that showed the dignity and honour of the dynasty, but equally important was humility in design. Feng Shui was also far more important than grandiosity, much time was spent by geomancers to select the best location for royal palaces or tombs. Changdeokgung is considered one of the finest locations of any building in Korea.  Changdeokgung encapsilates this philosphy better than any other Korean palace, and this is one reason it is a Unesco World Heritage site. For 288 years Changdeokgung was the primary palace of the very long ruling Joseon dynasty. Kings were born, numerous royal weddings took place, and royalty died in this palace complex. Kings wrote poetry in the secret garden, one famous poem is etched in stone here.  It is true some parts of the palace have been rebuilt after Korea's tumultous history during the 20th century, but there are numerous structures that are very well preserved. Geumcheongyo Bridge is the oldest bridge in Seoul and dates back to 1411. The oldest wooden buildings are from the 17th century, as the palace was burned to the ground in the Imjin War. Injeongjeon Hall, the most grand building of the palace was last rebuilt in 1804.  The secret garden is the most celebrated of all Korean gardens, in which harmony with nature is of primary importance. Much of the trees in the garden are over 300 years old, some planted by royalty. It should also be noted that IUCN designated the secret garden as a conservation area because of its diverse ecosystem and landscape, despite being in central Seoul.  I have taken 5 tours of Changdeokgung palace, all of them different. It is one of the most important historical sites related with the Joseon dynasty. If history is not your thing, at the very least you can enjoy the beautful garden and imagine a different age.",821,much
822,268,2622,"I only visited this palace because I had extra time in Seoul and had half a day to spend on this palace, Insa-dong, and the Buchon villiage. Do not expect a grand palace as Gyeongbokgung. If you want to visit, come for the history not for the sight.  Unlike Gyeongbokgung which is connected to the subway station, the Changaokgung is a bit of a walk from the subway station. Just when I thought I missed it, there it was. This palace does not boast a large foot print and does not have as many grand structures as Gyeongbokgung. There is no guards nor ceramoney. There is not much to see really. The english tour is only about $3 and the guide tried her best and made the palace tour more interesting than it was.  There is a secret garden behind the palace, which occupies most of the land and requires a seperate entrance which I will described below. The tour costs $5 and the tour guide also did a great job. However, the garden is similar to our community garden back home, with a few traditional Korean structures scattered around. It is a hilly garden and not the best for the physically challenged.  If anyone is planning on a day tour to cover this palace, the secret garden, Insa-dong, and the village, one needs to be fit. If you are like me who only hikes 2-5 miles a day, I recommend skipping the secret garden (or the Changdaekgung all together) and use your time and energy for other things more exciting in Seoul, which are plentiful. You can read about the history of Changdaekgung without spending precious time here.",822,much
823,269,2634,"Good to read up first and focus on the chambers that you intend to visit. A guided tour would be good to explain in details. Wonderful experience to witness the change-of-guard possession. Take it easy, savour the rich culture, close your eyes and envision the time the Officers were standing according to their ranks. I did not walk around too much but the ancient buildings, vastness, how sommers were being kept cool (by lifting doors in hanging horizontal positions) were a marvel.",823,much
824,270,2637,"If you're palace hopping in Seoul, this one is highly recommended -- there are quite a few buildings to check out, regular English tours of the buildings and the Secret Garden, and plenty of spots for interesting pictures. You can check out the buildings unguided, and that would take up less than an hour (depending on how short your attention span is). I didn't get a guide and that's probably why I left thinking it was a pretty place but without much insight on the history (brochure was pretty thin and mostly served as a map).  Re Secret Garden, when choosing an exit option, the ""never before trodden"" one is okay -- they say it's hilly and long but it didn't feel like it was more difficult to walk that way than the ""retracing your steps to the entrance of the garden"" route. Budget 1.5 hours for the Secret Garden if you're guided (in certain seasons, you can wander about unguided). English tourists on the 11:30 run -- bring a sandwich and a drink! It's a huge garden, and you can't get lunch inside.  While there, see the Bukchon houses and Insadong -- these top tourist spots are all near the Anguk Station.",824,much
825,271,2641,"Apart from the size, I'm not impress with this palace much. The style are similar to other palace in Seoul. It's also very crowded, so full of people rushing to follow tour guides.",825,much
826,272,2644,"The palace itself is average. You cannot go inside any of the buildings, but the grounds are well kept and the exteriors are well renovated. The guided tours are awful, so don't waste your time. The guides rush from location to location and begin speaking as soon as they reach the next spot, but before the majority of the travelers have caught up. Even with a microphone, we could not hear what one of our guide was saying she spoke so softly. The groups, especially for the Huwon, are massive, so that also makes it challenging to keep up and hear your tour. Also, the guides dictate, verbatim, what is in the pamphlet they hand you when you buy your tickets, so you could easily have a much more enjoyable self-guided tour on your own schedule. While we were able to tour the Huwon on our own, I do believe for the most part, you are required to be with a guide. The Huwon was beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there photographing it. Do not expect your typical floral garden- there are very few flowers in the Huwon, which our friends were disappointed to discover. The garden features nicely maintained buildings, some small ponds and lots of greenery on well shaded pathways. The Huwon is a great stop in Korea.",826,much
827,273,2645,The others were much more pleasing to the eye. Still important part of Korean history.,827,much
828,274,2648,This palace certainly has a lot to explore. But you do not need to know the history because the buildings are magnificent without knowing the history.  There are a number of buildings to work around and a plethora of things to learn - if you are interested take a guide from the front and work slowly round each building.  The gardens look wonderful but we spent so much time wandering through the buildings that we ran out of time to investigate the 'Secret Gardens'.,828,much
829,275,2649,"The size of the palace is impressive, and if you take into account that the secret gardens are also part of it, you will definitely have things to see for a couple of hours. We did not visit the secret garden, because the reviews said that it's not the typical garden full of flowers. And we thought that we pretty much saw the korean style garden around the palace itself. However we also visited the Changgyeong palace, which you can get to from inside this palace (entrance next to the meeting point for the secret garden). From there we headed to the Jongmyo shrine, which was about a 15 minute walk. Besides its size, I personally didn't find anything outstanding about this palace. I have seen other asian palaces which were much more adorned - I honestly expected more design (inside and outside) that what it actually had. However the buildings are well maintained and the surrounding area / park is clean. The place is very dusty, so by the end of your visit you will most likely have to clean your shoes.",829,much
830,276,2651,"There are about 5 palaces around Seoul. Read up on them, pick carefully, and go to some, BUT NOT ALL as much is replicated. For a deeper insight into them, take a guided tour at one, but no more.",830,much
831,277,2661,"We very much enjoyed our visit to Changdeokgung Palace but more so our guided Secret Garden tour. We used the handbook that was given to us at the ticket office to self guide our way around the Palace, we probably only spent one hour wandering around before our secret garden tour. On the day of our visit there would have been around 50 people in our tour, the guide managed the number very well, waiting in most instances for everyone to catch up when walking from one site to another.  The tour lasts 1 hour and 40 minute, apparently Autumn is the best time of year to visit per the guide, but we very much enjoyed what nature had on offer, the cherry blossoms were out, and that's a nice thing. The secret garden was built for the sole use of the royal family in Joseon Dynasty, even today it is a peaceful place in a busy city. The water features are not as stunning as they would have been in the 1400s when they were designed, due to the growth of the city, so one can only imagine what is was like back then. There is a lot of walking on the tour, some steep hills and stairs to navigate, it is surprising how unfit most people were in our tour, young and old, and they would lag behind, but the tour seems to accommodate this.  As we were staying in downtown Seoul we were able to walk from our hotel to the Palace. I had reserved our places for the tour online the night before, but never needed to show my reservation number at the ticket office as they were plenty of tickets available on the day.",831,much
832,278,2670,"We visited this palace and enjoyed it. However, don't expect to see much, as it's a replica (most burned either during the 1910 occupation, WWII or the Korean war) and there is literally no furniture par a bed and a throne to see. The gardens are probably the biggest asset. We didn't visit those as you need to follow a guided tour and that didn't fit our schedule.",832,much
833,279,2674,"A visit here will make for a pleasant hour or two of your day. There's not much to see except for lovely old buildings and gardens, so it's not mentally exhausting like a museum -- more like a walk in a World Heritage park.  Tours of the Palace and Secret Garden are offered in English at 11:30 and 14:30 (closed Mondays). There are tours offered in other languages at different times, but I'm sorry I can't remember them all. You must be on a tour to enter the Secret Garden, but you don't need it for the Palace. If you choose not to take a tour of the Palace grounds, make sure you grab one of the little green information booklets (free) from the entrance gate, as there isn't much signage to tell you what you're looking at.",833,much
834,280,2687,"If you are debating which palace to go to (because there are just so many in Seoul), this one is the best to see in Spring because of its beautiful gardens. Make sure you go earlier in the day if you go because sometimes the garden tours close pretty early. I would say however that the garden tour isn't much to see in summer (there aren't any real colors...just lots of trees). I have gone to the palaces every season except winter and spring is best for the garden but fall could come in a very close seconds. It's all personal preference. This palace also ""connects"" to another palace area so you could wipe out two birds with one stone by going to see this one instead.",834,much
835,281,2693,"We visited early in the morning, not knowing the tour schedules. I remember enjoying the early morning walk with the chilly autumn air and the misty almost empty streets until we came to the gate of the palace, which I thought was*the* palace at first since it was so large.  We spent about an hour touring the place by ourselves and mingled with the other tourists reading the brochures and the markers until it was finally time for the English guided tour at 10.30 a.m.  There were actually many tourists around, most of them I think were Japanese or Korean, but the place was so large that the compound never felt full, it seemed rather empty even!  We were glad we joined the guided tour. There are much more fascinating facts to be learned about the buildings and the comings and goings of the Joseon dynasty members that we didn't find out just by reading the brochure or palace markers.  We didn't get to visit all the palaces in Seoul, but we were definitely glad we visited this one. Truly a beautiful and historical site.  If you are going there, wear comfortable shoes and prepare to walk a lot. The compound is big and will take about two hours worth of walking to explore sufficiently (not fully, I think you'd need a day or two for that). And don't miss the tour of the Secret Garden near the back area of the palace! This requires a separate entrance fee and has a different tour schedule.",835,much
836,282,2696,"The location of the palace is very easy to get to: you can either take the Seoul City tour bus and stop here, or you can take the metro and alight at the station (there are signs in the subway that will direct you to which exit is closest).  There's always a line outside so be mindful of the crowds. There's an entrance fee, and you can purchase a ticket from a booth located outside the main gates. You can also opt for an English tour, which only goes for certain times in the day (we chose the 11 am slot). The tour doesn't start on time because the guide wants to get as much of the English-speaking people together as possible (there was only one person doing the tour for about 20 people). This particular tour goes on for around two hours and only covers the palace grounds; you'll have to purchase another ticket for the Secret Garden tour, which only goes in the afternoon (in my case it had been around 2 pm).  Because we were so many, it was hard to hear the guide speak. She was dressed in a bright and colorful Hanbok (I think so it's easier for us to spot her) and brought around a small microphone but we still strained to hear what she was talking about. She also had a folder with pictures of things so we had a visual of stuff she talked about. You can ask her questions if you misheard something or would like to learn more, but I recommend you do this aside so it doesn't prolong everyone. It's very scripted and impersonal. In every station she allots a few minutes so you can take pictures or explore the area on your own before moving on. As I mentioned earlier, this was just a tour of the main palace, so she took us to the sleeping quarters, the library, the ritual house, the kitchens, the receiving area, the bridge, etc. On the day that we went it wasn't crowded so we were able to take photos without random people in it.  The tour of the Secret Garden was the highlight of this experience. You buy a separate ticket and can opt for the English tour as well, but others just choose to walk the course by themselves (which eventually you will do because the place will absorb you). The grounds are MASSIVE. The emperor had it right having a whole freaking park as his backyard. He and the crown prince had their own libraries, and plenty of pavilions that allowed you a view of, say, the lake from different angles. The buildings are pretty far from each other (you will mostly just walk) because they go with the natural flow of the mountain. Our tour guide (dressed in the same bright Hanbok and armed with the same tiny mic) was a little scary because she looked like she was having a bad day. She wasn't very open to questions and those she did answer she returned with monosyllables and a glare. Her pace is just right, allowing maybe 7 minutes per station (including photo-taking), and she keeps reminding you that you can go off by yourself and never get lost as long as you follow the paved path. I should mention that before you start the tour, you should head to the bathroom because there are no others in the area save for the one at the souvenir shop near the entrance. You should also bring an umbrella along during their rainy season, because chances are it WILL rain and there is nowhere you can seek shelter. Also bring a water bottle because it is a long walk and you may get thirsty along the way.  They have justifiably named this a world heritage site, and you cannot pass this up when you come to Seoul.",836,much
837,283,2704,"Seoul was made the capital city of Korea over six centuries back by the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910). It was the last Dynasty to rule Korea before that country was taken over by Japan. Korea became independent again only after Japan's defeat in World War II - only to be divided between the democratic South and the Communist North. Today, The South is a showpiece liberal democracy, while the North has the most repressive regime anywhere.  The Gyeongbokgung Palace (gung means palace) is the oldest and largest palace to be built by that dynasty, with the huge main building having an imposing Korean-style double roof. Visitors can have themselves pictured with the ""Royal Guards"", dressed in colourful peroid costumes, and carrying weapons of their times. On my last day in Seoul, I was fortunate to witness a detailed religious ceremony featuring numerous priests, singers and dancers, all in colourful period costumes. It was living history at its best. (Admission Won 3,000, Tuesdays closed). On the palace grounds are the excellent National Palace Museum of Korea and the National Folk Museum of Korea (entry free, closed on Mondays and Tuesdays, respectively).  The Changdeokgung Palace, set up later, became the favourite residence of later Joseon Dynasty Kings, and is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It has numerous wooden buildings, esthetically painted, and displaying an understated elegance. Korean palaces are very different from the ostentatious palaces of Western Europe. The attached Huwon Garden is a beautiful example of Joseon-period garden architecture. The King and his people would stroll around the lotus pond and even discuss matters of state there. (Admission Won 3,000, closed on Mondays. Tour of garden Won 5,000 more)..  Right next to it is the smaller Changgyeonggung Palace, built as the residence of three dowager Queens. It is also worth a visit. The Deoksugung and Gyeonghuigung Palaces are much smaller still, and less important.  Tourists should preferably visit only the first two palaces mentioned above, and the Jongmyo Shrine - the Royal ancestrial shrine of the Joseon Dynasty, located nearby..  Seoul is so rich in historical and cultural attractions, world-class museums and art galleries, and classical music and dance performances, that my ten-day itinerary was inadequate to cover even half of it.

They provide all facilities like rentals lockers within this price. Ladies hair dress is additional KRW 5000. Overall a good experience to go for this.  Please also note that in case you are wearing the Traditional clothes the entry fee to palace is waived off.  The place is easily accessible through public transport.

So you are seeing fairly modern materials and construction techniques. It feels a bit staged as a result.  If you’re short on time and have seen an Asian palace before then you can afford to skip this one.

Our guide was entertaining and shared many stories about the royalties, as well as the palace architecture. Now I understand why some of the doors are built so low...  The pace of the tour was relaxing. There were some steps (upslope) towards the end but nothing difficult. I don’t consider myself fit and/or athletic, but I had no problems keeping up with the group. My two little kids managed very well too!  You may want to visit the loo before the tour. There is only one toilet break during the 90min tour. No outside food and drinks allowed.

One-third through the tour, at this beautiful part with the pond & the pavilion is.......it started to snow !! Magical !! And the snow got heavier & heavier. I'd never forget this special moment!

It's 3000 won entrance fee and you have to pay extra for the secret garden, which I think is what everyone wants to see. It's another 2000 won and you can only go as part of a guided tour. There is not much shade so it's pretty hot on a summer's day.  Bukchon Village and Insadong Street are close by.",861,nothing
862,23,1212,"We visit the palace for the secret garden, it's a must visit if you are here. Join the garden tour, the story and explanation is interesting and meaningful to learn about Korea's culture and history.  The garden area is big, everywhere is pretty scenic and serene, surrounded by greens. The atmosphere is just lovely, I bet it would be beautiful during autumn with the fall colors. The tour goes through some slopes and hills, so be sure to wear comfortable shoes for walking. Tour guide was really friendly and is willing to answer all our questions.  After the secret garden tour, we visited some other buildings in the palace, there are very similar with other palace, so nothing new for us.",862,nothing
863,24,1430,"After visiting Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung is nothing too grand. The Secret Garden is the highlight of this place, so make sure you make your reservation online (no booking/admission payment required until ticket redemption at the booth). They are very strict with the timing so do arrive 20 minutes before the tour time. We were 10 minutes earlier and we had to join the next session.  It was early Spring time and the flowers hasn't bloomed so the secret garden wasn't at its prettiest. The place is very mystical, scenic and calming, ZEN. Our tour guide was super sassy, entertaining in a way.  There'll be alot of walking so make sure you're in proper walking shoes!",863,nothing
864,25,1482,"THE GOOD  I like the fact that they really preserve the place. They did a little renovation to preserve the place. Aside from stairs they have ramp for baby's stroller. Clean comfort room.  I like the history of Korea that is why I enjoy the place, but if you are not, don't go.  We are lucky that our Tour Specialist is very knowledgeable and was able to explain everything. every corner of the palace have their reason and purpose.  NEED TO IMPROVE  nothing! I like it just the way it is. very old and preserve.",864,nothing
865,26,1501,"This Palace is easily reachable by underground or taxi. Most beautiful trees with red leaves mixing other pine trees were all bald at winter time, so it not as colourful as it is in pictures shot in autumn. All buildings were the same and very plain, may interested those architectural lovers. We attempted to pay fee for the secret garden which must be entered with a tour guide but unfortunately one only time with a chinese tour guide on sunday, for the whole day, can you imagine how interested it can be. The palace charge extra money to enter the secret garden but the service is so limited and travellers take so much time to go there. Tour guides in English is also limited. And I did not think I saw any timetable for the secret garden at the main entrance, may be it is a little secret that should not tell travellers. The ticket seller, probably has limited english ability and will just answer the money you need to pay but nothing else. So if you go, it would be better to enquire the tour guide time for the secret garden if you do not want to miss the boat.",865,nothing
866,27,1522,"The palace grounds and buildings are very beautiful. There's a lot of walking involved. In the rear of the palace on the north side is the garden area or Biwon. You have to buy a separate ticket or pay for both palace grounds and biwon together. The garden was really interesting and beautiful but understand you'll be walking uphill a lot and can only go during a tour. They don't allow people to wander around by themselves. I dislike tours groups but there was nothing I could do. If you have a lot of time to sightsee around Seoul, try all the palaces. If your time is limited, pick either this one or gyeongbukgung (which is a few blocks away)...it's not worth cramming both into one trip to Seoul. IMO, I would pick gyeongbukgung since you also have the option of visiting 2 museums on the palace grounds as well as lockers to stash your bags. Also #5 line lets you out right under the entrance.",866,nothing

868,29,1526,"Beauty enriched by time. Walking through the palace grounds gives the visitor a sense of ancient Korea especially if you are a fan of Korean period dramas. The entrance is a massive gate adorned with colourful patterns and carvings on wood. Ticket is very reasonable especially if you buy the combination ticket for the five grand palaces of Seoul. This ticket includes the secret garden in this palace as well which I recommend you to see but once you reach the pavilion with the pond where the souvenir shop is you may stop there because the rest will be a long walk with tree lined uphill path and some more pavilion, nothing else. The Injeongjeon Hall is the throne hall of the palace. There are also small buildings which good picture backgrounds with less people like the Huijeongdang Hall. A map of the palace is essential.",868,nothing
869,30,1649,"The timing was hard because we got up early and nothing opens until 9am or later! With Chusok holiday, even more may have been closed. This ""thanksgiving holiday"" is long. In tour books it seems like it's a day and for us it was Sunday but nothing was back open as usual until Wednesday!  We walked to gyeongbokgung palace but it was closed!  The palace doesn't seem as grandiose as the Gyeongbokgung palace but I couldn't believe how much more there was to the grounds. We explored on our first and then waited for an English speaking tour to pass and then hopped on. We had to pass time before our secret garden tour. I ""reserved"" online weeks before but it didn't seem to matter when we got to the ticket booth. They say that half of the tickets are reserved and the other half is on the day of. 11yo lasted through 2/3 of it but it was still worth it. The English speaking tours are later in the morning so we seemed to be waiting around. We should have prepared better and done bukchon village which is close or jongmyo shrine which is also close.",869,nothing
870,31,1679,"I am a history major, and I usually love these historical attractions, but I couldn't have been less interested with this palace. Maybe, its because I live in China and have seen structures like this before that I just really thought this attraction was not that interesting.  It wasn't really that old, as many buildings were rebuilt many times. The buildings had nothing inside, so they seemed just like empty shells. Much of the ground was just gravel, thus lifeless. Finally, there were only general descriptions of a couple areas, not descriptions for each building. Basically, there was no narrative to the entire place. If compared to similar buildings in China, there is no comparison. Even though the buildings in China are usually tourist traps, they tell you a story. For me that is important  One thing I can say about the place is that it is really cheap. My wife and I paid 6,000 won to get into both of the eastern palaces. That's basically six US dollars.  It is good to see the history of Korea in the Joseon palaces, but don't waste more than a morning on them.",870,nothing
871,32,1799,"All the palaces seem similar, but the exception here is the secrete garden tour, which is a guided hike through a large, hilly, forested area around the palace. It is not really what you would normally consider a garden at all. But each garden area is very nicely done and has traditional buildings. A guided tour must be purchased separately for the garden.  The palace itself is good to quickly look around. But nothing new if you have seen other palaces. Look for tours with your preference if you want, but I don't think it is necessary to enjoy.",871,nothing
872,33,1928,"The only way to get into the garden is with a tour, it's about USD $3 more. Going completely solo and taking a decent amount of pictures it took me about 45 minutes to see the palace grounds (which was a bit rushed) and still make my Secret Garden tour. Make sure you arrive a few minutes early - they limit the size of the tour group! Some people ended up getting bounced to a tour 30 minutes later just because they strolled up on time rather than 5-7 minutes early.  The Secret Garden is great to see, but in March nothing is yet in bloom so 90 minutes can feel a bit long. Still, the guides are good and speak excellent English.",872,nothing

875,36,2122,"I have not seen Changdeokgung in the daytime, so this review is strictly about the Moonlight Tour. I was looking forward to the tour with great anticipation, as it is only offered to foreigners six nights a year, with a limit of 100 tickets per night. I made a special point to be online and order tickets the minute they went on sale, that's how much I wanted to take this tour.  The tour was offered in English, Chinese, and Japanese, and attendees were divided into groups accordingly. That part was good. I expected the pathways, buildings and garden to be illuminated (not brightly so as to recreate daytime, but at least so that we could see what we were being shown) but sadly, this was not the case. A small number of attendees were asked to carry paper lanterns as we walked the grounds, and there were a few lights on the buildings, but I couldn't really see much. The pathways were unlit (the few paper lanterns scattered about were ineffective), and the ground is quite uneven, with random obstacles on the path (something which looked like pipe vents, at one point there was something that looked like an empty concrete pond, completely unlit, which someone could easily have tripped into), and we were marched from building to building very quickly. There was a lot of hiking up stairs and then down stairs, all stone, all uneven, all unlit. What could have been a pleasant walking tour felt more like a march in the dark. We were ""treated"" to a tour of the rear ""secret"" garden but were unable to see anything - I mean absolutely nothing. So what was the point of taking us through the garden? I'm still not sure.  When we reached the pavilion at the end of the garden, there was one building which was beautifully lit, with a large (unlit) pond in front of it. A musician played a traditional Korean gayageum, and we got to sit and listen for about 10 minutes. This part of the tour was quite lovely.  Tea and traditional Korean sweets were part of the tour, but the tea was served in paper cups - take one as you walk past a table, and keep moving - and the sweets were handed to you in a (very nice) fabric bag. I didn't expect a formal tea ceremony, but I also didn't expect a paper cup. This was just one more disappointment.  From there we sat as an audience in front of a stage area, where we were treated to another lovely musical performance consisting of several different types of performances. This was the highlight of the tour. If this had not been included, my rating would have been ""poor"" rather than ""average."" After that, we had to walk about 15 minutes back to the entrance, with no guidance, minimal lighting, and, once again, hidden obstacles.  Cost: 30,000 won per person. I would not recommend it. Go in the daytime, walk at your own pace, and you will undoubtedly get much more enjoyment for much less money.",875,nothing
876,37,2175,"We made sure to research online and pop by the palace at a timing when there were free English tours given. The tourguide's English was understandable and I believe we had a rather interesting time there.  Nonetheless, it has been a year since I last went (late review is late), and I can safely tell you that I recall nothing from my trip to the palace other than the fact I've been there. So, I suppose while it made for an interesting stop, it wasn't memorable.  Drop by the palace if you have time, and if you really want to be able to cross it off your list. If not, I believe there can be better ways for you to enjoy your trip in Seoul.",876,nothing
877,38,2202,"Disclaimer: We didn't take the secret garden tour. It was really hot and we're not big into long, guided tours. The Palace and Grounds (minus the secret garden) were very average.

The Secret garden trees were mostly bare in March.There is nothing of much interest if you compare this to the other grand gardens of the East or West.The guide(in English) for the palace was pleasant but the guide for the Secret Garden was a bit snotty and it is a long long walk so beware,879,nothing
880,41,2277,"Having been to the Forbidden Palace in Beijing... nothing else could really compare, so I was a bit biased! This palace was very easy to find and easy to get to which was great. The inside was quite nice too, although it is mostly empty rooms... There wasnt that many visitors when I went so you could see everything and take decent pictures without a swarm of people in your photos. However, I was rather disappointed that they had 'sold out' of tickets for the secret garden! It was the main reason I went... I don't really know how tickets for a garden could sell out... anyway... so you've got to go super early to get tickets for that! I think I went around midday and there were no tickets left. Anyway, this is quite a nice place to go for history and photos. Theres a small coffee shop and souvenir shop inside.",880,nothing

Awesome photo taking opportunity. Try to be present when the English speaking tour is being conducted as that will give you more insight into all the pavilions and buildings in the large garden. The guide will point out several interesting aspects of the garden which you might miss out on your own. Rest of the Palace buildings are interesting but nothing special unless you like history and architecture. There are 2 tours being conducted, one for the Palace and the other for the Secret Garden.",881,nothing
882,43,2380,"With 5 palaces in Seoul, Changdeokgung Palace (창덕궁) is the place to be if you want to admire the pretty spring/autumn blossoms set amidst a historic cultural backdrop (that and a good workout with all that walking!). Famed for its gardens, Changdeokgung Palace’s Secret Garden (Biwon 비원 / Huwon 후원) is the place to be if you want to admire some pretty spring/autumn blossoms!  Having a guide is great for understanding the history and hearing the stories come to life. Of course, there are guide books and signage, but nothing beats having a guide narrate to you while you take in the scenery and historical architecture around you. The admission for the Secret Garden Tour is an additional ₩5,000, but well worth it. You can always purchase the Secret Garden Tour on the spot, or you could reserve online.  After all the walking, there is a rest stop within the palace ground. The toilet is clean and the rest stop has some pretty neat souvenirs, there is even free wi-fi.

The entrance fee is just a few bucks so when u visit this palace with high expectations, u lose nothing but just time. Just go in and have a feel of the korean palaces. At least when u visit one, u feel the connection when you watch korean dramas.",887,nothing
