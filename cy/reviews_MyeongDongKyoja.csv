50,"Never fail to visit this restaurant every time I go to South Korea. I know it has now gone into the Michelin list. Well deserved! Delicious, fuss-free, good value for money. Only a few items on the menu. Order and pay on the spot and they serve within 5 minutes. What else can one ask for?"
30,"Fast delivery of food with the specialization of only 4 dishes. It was an experience, but I would not rate the food very high as it was not to my liking."
50,"Super fast service, and the food was amazing, rich taste. I would recommend this place especially if your in a hurry they are super fast."
50,"Simple menu, fast lunch service and great tasting food. I had the beef soup with dumplings and kimchee on side. The tables have Plexi glass partitions for the Covid-19 precaution. You pay up front with cash or bank card."
50,"No surprise why there are two locations in a 2 block radius! Best noodles I’ve had in Korea, tons of locals and quick and easy. You are expected to go in and out quickly, and masks and other health precautions are a must."
50,Definitely must try when you visit Myeongdong. I personally don't really eat dumplings but this one was really good and tasty! Order a tray with a bowl of noodles to share because the portion was really huge! It can get really packed so be expected to wait awhile for a table.
50,"The dumpling is absolutely tasty and one should not miss if they visit Seoul. The dumplings are different from those in Hong Kong, Japan or China. These steamed dumplings are healthy to eat. The noodles are also a must try with delicious kimchi."
40,"This place is famous, some say it is overhyped and others say it’s the best. You have to go and make your mind up for yourself. I thought it was a good meal, especially in the winter."
50,"Accidentally found this Michelin star restaurant while shopping in Myeongdong, and the table was available so we tried. The restaurant cleverly serves only 5-6 main dishes, so we selected some of them, they were very tasty."
50,"I'm a dumpling lover and the dumplings certainly did not disappoint on my first night in Seoul!  You can tell how meaty the fillings are and the texture of the skin in the photos. Have been dreaming of these dumplings for years since I saw them on Tumblr. My dreams have came true!  The partner enjoyed the hot bowl of noodles, however the serving is too much for me. If you're going there specially for the dumplings like me, I suggest ordering the dumplings and you can request a bowl of rice for the staff :)  P.S. the kimchi here is very spicy! Take at your own risk! :P"
50,"Maybe there are better tastes. But, the overall experience here is above all others. Even if this restaurant opened decades ago, it's clean and not expensive. Employees are kind. Queuing doesn't take long. You can order free rice. Also, if your table has one kalguksu per person, additional guksu(noodle) is free. The only thing I don't like is their kimchi is too spicy even for locals. haha."
50,"No wonder they got michelin star! Kalguksu was really delicious, the noodles so soft, broth was so tasty and meat were melted in the mouth."
50,"After touring seoul on a wet cold day we came here for dinner. Delicious. Very limited menu which is fine. We were the only tourists, the rest locals. We had hot noodle soup each and shared the dumplings (you get 10). You pay immediately (before your food comes in cash). The food was fantastic, definitely recommend."
50,"great food, inexpensive. can't go wrong with the noodles and dumplings. simple and classic. 60 years of tradition."
50,No other words to describe that bowl of noodles and the soup! You just gotta try! Its dumplings are good too if you are a meat lover - seductively packed with meat! A-must for anyone who goes to Korea!
50,"I would review more Korean restaurants if the restaurants that I dined at had any English in their signage. Well this particular restaurant is different in that it was recommended and rated by the Michelin Star reviews. Gave it a five rating in that it was so affordable and even though the menu was limited...it was delicious. The specialty is noodle and dumplings, So if you order two bowls of dumpling noodle soup and steam dumplings along with the side dishes, it was more than adequate without breaking your daily travel allowance. It was so good that we made a return visit to this noodle place. This is a cash only establishment but boy are they fast in bringing your orders!"
50,"I totally love Mondu, we got a mixture of them, everyone of them were delicious, the sauce is so good, the freshly made sides, was the best I have ever had. Soup is very very good. SoJu to top it off. What a great experience"
40,"It was a good experience to have the dumplings in a traditional restaurant. The dumplings matched well with the vinegar and Korean sauce. The auntie was so nice to offer delicious kimchi. Yet, it was a bit too many dumplings for one person – to finish 10 dumplings at once was not an easy task!"
40,We were staying in Namdaemun and of course had to go to Myeondong for some shopping. We stopped in around 3:30 pm and got a table right away. We just ordered a couple of Mandoo. Each order is 10000 won and there are 10 pieces. They take payment right away. They do accept credit cards.  There is also complimentary kim chee and someone walks around if you need more. Noticed they have been given the 2020 Michelin Bib Gourmand distinction.
40,Noodle reminds us of the Singapore ban mian but I like this better. Long queue but quick and efficient service. Pay before get the food. Their dumplings are good especially with their super spicy kimchi.
50,"A friend of mine took me here and this place is heaven, but it can get very busy for dinner, so arrive early! The Kimchi here is one of the spiciest I've had during the trip, but it's super nice and garlicky. Kalguksu noodles were superb and very hearty, so a great choice for winters. They have 3 locations and from what I remember 2 of them are on the same street. Went to the original establishment in which, unsurprisingly, was also the busiest."
30,"There was a queue but it moved fast. The restaurant is 3 storey high so plenty of seats although fully occupied even for late lunch. There were basically 3 dishes to choose from and our orders came very quickly. Payment to be made right after order, and chewing gums were given after meals.  Taste wise, didnt find it extraordinary but it was nice, was expecting Gyoza (steamed and slightly brown on one side) but ended up served steamed only on a steam tray."
50,"The menu does not offer endless options but the restaurant is a classic! Once you go there you become a regular, even if you’re a tourist in Seoul. Endless servings of Kimchi and the delicious Kalguksu are just some of the reasons that ties you to this humble restaurant. Went there every day of my Seoul trip. Not disappointed."
40,"The kalguksu noodles were soft & tender. The soup refreshing & warm. The dumplings were meaty in very thin wraps. We ordered one dish of each which was good to share. Menu items are very limited, testament to the tastiness & quick service despite heavy crowds. Affordable lovely comfort meal."
40,"When you get hungry and cold after shopping along the cold streets of Myeongdong, I would certainly recommend stepping into Myeongdong Kyoja for a bowl of hot dumpling noodles or a plate steam meat dumplings. And they have special korean spicy sauce to go with it as well as the white vinegar. In fact the dumplings here are so good that they have received they have been on the Michelin guide 4 years in a row. And it is not an expensive meal at all. one more thing, don't expect refined service here."
50,"The steam dumplings here is a must try. Noodles serving is relatively huge. We (2 adults and 1 10yr old) ordered 2 bowls of non spicy noodle soup and a basket of steam dumplings. Extremely, extremely filling and satisfying."
40,"Lots of good reviews on this noodle joint. With only 4 selections on the menu and yet is always filled with crowd. You know you have to give it a try. For non spicy eater, you can go for the white noodle soup cooked in chicken broth. The noodle is simple with minced meat and a few dumplings. Soup is enhanced with ikan bilis ( anchovies )flavour. No frills but comforting on a cold weather. The spicy dry cold noodles is yum too if you can take spicy food. We ordered the dumplings too. Overall, not very outstanding in my opinion but worth a try."
50,At peak dinner time there is a long queue but service is very fast and do not have to wait too long. However the wait is worth it. The dumplings are one of the best I have tasted. The noodle are also very very good. Service is ultra fast and you can finish your dinner and gone very quickly. You would not want to hang around after eating as the place is tight and do not wish to let people queing to wait too long to get your table. Been there twice within one week.
50,"Heard about this place listed on Michelin Guide and so we had to check it out. The place is fairly big, but condensed with people. Luckily we came a bit early and didn't have to wait for a spot. Menu was simple, I think it was only about 4-5 different items. I got the mandu and also kalguksu (noodle soup). They were delicious! The mandu goes well with whatever garlic sauce they had on the table. Furthermore, their kimchi was spicy but addicting! I will definitely go back here again"
40,"The restaurant has only 3 items on its menu - 10pc mandu, noodles with soup, dry spict noodles.  We ordered the soupy noodles for everyone and shared the mandu. The bowls of noodles are huge. I could only eat half of it. My husband polished the balance off after finishing his own bowl. ha ha. The soup broth is fragrant and the minced meat and dumplings in it are good.  The mandu is really good. A must-try when you come to this place.  Restaurant looks tiny but they have more space upstairs. The lady boss will direct u to go in and take a lift to the 3rd floor if the ground floor is fully occupied.  We were surprised to find that this restaurant has been on the Michelin Bib Gourmand list for 3 years."
40,"The food was definitely worth our money, especially during the cold winter. Their kimchi is completely beyond what we have in my home country, with a spice level i absolutely love. The noodle choices are very limited, but because they do them so well, that point often does not matter.  The dumplings are so good! We heard that they were a 'must try' so we got them. Completely lived up to the hype.  Staff tried hard to communicate with us even though there were some issues since we could not understand Korean. As an introvert, was a little intimidated by them and would not come by myself.  Overall, it was very filling and good! Definitely will recommend. Their warm noodles are amazing and the food is served almost immediately after we order. It was amazing"
50,Don’t be daunted by the lineup ...people eat quickly after they order from the limited menu options. Everything is tasty! Inexpensive Michelin Bib Gourmand that’s so accessible for all. Go!
50,"Every time I come to Seoul, I will come here for the noodles and dumplings. And each and every time it never fails to deliver! This dish just delivers comfort to the soul, especially during winter. Add in the kimchi to the soup and the taste just elevates to another level. Just brought my mum there tonight and she gave her thumbs up for the noodles and soup!"
40,"Portion is big. I shared one noodles and one order of dumplings with my sister and we struggled to finish everything between us. The noodles are ok. I love the dumplings, skin is not too thick, filling is flavorful and texture is perfect. The kimchi they serve packs a punch in terms of spice level and is my favourite out of all that I have tried. It has a distinct garlicky taste to it. It is a no-frills place, order and pay before food is served. Perfect for single diners too."
50,Still the best noodle stall in Myeong-dong. The spicy cold noodle is very good. One serving is never enough.
50,"There’re 2 restaurants in Myeongdong. You just come in, get menu, choose, pay right away and then in 5-10 min they bring you what you’ve ordered. Unlimited kimchi:) You don’t need to give any tips. Quick and good service, not expensive and very very tasty! Good place to eat there if you are in Myeongdong."
50,"We are a family of 5 and had 2 Kim Chi noodles, 2 soup noodles and 1 dumpling. The servings were large and food tasty with fast service before the lunch time crowd. The soup has onions, black fungus, mushrooms and minced pork. The noodles in the spicy noodles were unique. The dumplings were the best of the lot.  This place has 3 years Michelin Bib Gourmand. Recommended if your are in this part of town."
30,"There are only 4 items on the menu and we had 3 of them. Dumplings were nice but not fantastic. I find the noodles a little too thick and the soup was only so-so. For me, the dish that stole the limelight was the kimchi. Their kimchi has a kick to it and was tasty and crunchy. This place is a Michelin restaurant though so if you are in the Myeongdong area, no harm visiting."
50,"Outstanding Kyoja, kimchi with fire, and Kalgoksuk was delicious. The menu is limited and what they offer is of highest quality."
50,"Best place ever, since my friend took me there last year i fall in love with the Kalguksu soup and mandu, it is the best place to have good noodles"
50,"Great atmosphere. Lots of customers. Wait-staff are very efficient. Reasonably priced. The Kalguksu is so simple yet so delicious. NIce clear, tasty broth. I loved it. The mandu/dumplings looked awesome too, but I didn't order it as I was just here by myself and wouldn't have been able to finish a serving of noodles and dunplings. Ate here twice during my Seoul visit. Miss it so much!"
50,"Food is very tasty, they make only 4 things but done very well. We shared dumplings and noodles, both of which were great. We didn’t experience any wait. You pay when you order and there is a piece of gum at the end."
50,"KYoja noodles and dumplings were a treat. The price was reasonable, one bowl of noodle plus 1 tray of dumplings (10 pcs) costs 19000 KRW will keep 2 persons full for the whole night."
50,Superfast and super yummy place. Truly a local experience at fab price. Perfect for a quick and tasteful lunch.
40,Lovely dumplings on the run. We visited after a recommendation and it did not disappoint. Quick service.
40,A must place for me to go to whenever I am in Seoul! Mandu and a hot bowl of noodles satisfy my hungry belly especially cold days. Brought 2 friends along this time. They love it. Went back again before home.
40,"Nothing fancy about this place at all, and it serves just a limited number of dishes. However, they're all delicious. Always busy but no queues as such when i was there. Perhaps because of the rapid service. Indeed, you pay first before being served (and not just the tourists). But it's all about the broth and then what you choose to put in it. Noodles. Dumplings. Kimchi on the side. Doesn't matter. All delicious."
30,"First visited Myeongdong Kyoja in 2018. Thought it was very good at the time. Visited again in 2019 and it was not as good as I remember it being.  We were seated in the upstairs area. Servers disappeared, could not place an order for several minutes after being seated. Finally was able to order the dumplings and 2 orders of soup. The dumplings are good, but the soup was just okay. The broth seemed much cloudier/thicker than it used to be. I was a little disappointed that I wasted a meal in Seoul coming back to eat here. I won't be coming again next time.  After you place your order, they will ask you for payment before you receive your food, just so you know. Makes it easy to get up and leave once you are finished."
50,"Nice Restaurant, even the menu is limited (just 4 items) which makes deciding and ordering very easy. There were Kalguksu (chopped noodle soup), Bibimguksu (spicy noodle soup), Mandu (dumplings), and Kongguksu (noodles in cold soybean soup). They are all priced at KRW 8,000 and they gave their house-made kimchi on the side. And the Kimchi is very good!  Must try their Mandu.. Mandu is steamed dumplings. It’s 10 big, plump, and juicy dumplings. These dumplings were absolutely scrumptious!"
40,"Went as solo traveler at dinner time. They welcomed solo travelers. Ordered dumpling noodle soup. Served side dishes as soon as I was seated down. Food came extremely fast, only few minutes after ordering. Soup was very flavourful, but noodle was way too soft for my liking."
50,"This place is worth queuing for. Line moves very quickly as they get you in and out fast. There are only 4 choices on the menu. We had two serves of noodle dumpling soup (Rich delicious broth, homemade noodles and nice dumplings with some mince). And one serve of steamed dumplings. Was plenty for 3 people. Kimchi is also served.  Easy to order if you don’t speak Korean. Really delicious and worth finding in Myeongdong!"
40,Decided to pay a visit upon a friend’s recommendation. There are only 4 items on the menu and we tried 2. The pork noodles soup and the dumplings. The filling in the dumplings were substantial underneath a crystal clear thin wrapping. The soup tasted like some sort of a braised sauce.
50,"We did not know this was in the Michelin guide. We ordered a steam dumplings, 2 hot noodles and 1 chilled dry noodles. I must admit - we did not like the chilled dry noodles. The rest of the dishes were awesome. Do take note that you must pay right after you placed your order with the staff."
40,"Once we got a table, ordered and paid our food, our food came really quickly. We ordered a bowl of gogi guksu & bibim guksu plus 2 baskets of mandu. I love the gogi guksu broth and the bibim guksu had a nice flavour to it. My daughter had a basket of mandu all to herself."
40,"Have my lunch here and is crowded and there is a long queue. However, the turnover is fast as the service is also fast. Menu with English is a bonus. One has to pay in advance before they serve your order. Like the cold noodles. The dumplings are just ok for me."
50,"It had been about five years since I had gone to this restaurant and it is just as good as ever. The dumplings are light and flavorful with a very thin wrapping: I managed to eat all ten of them by myself and still had room for the scrumptious Kalguksu soup with chicken broth, noodles, and pyramidal pork dumplings. The all-you-can eat kimchi is nice and spicy but not too hot. The staff are efficient: they are very busy but also kind and helpful. We had to wait in line, but the line moved quickly and we could take our time once we were seated. A treat!"
20,They demand payment in advance Very quick The servers work like a robot Not friendly They just serve without communion It is like a well-trianed emotionless robot.
40,"We like very much how the whole experience was organised. We went as a family of 6.  Upon entrance, we were told where to keep our stroller. With the number of headcounts, we were directed to 3rd floor. Upon arrival on 3rd floor, the staff showed us a table seating and provided us with a menu.  There were only 4 options, so it was quick for us to make our selection. We paid with credit card and the appetizers were served. Within 5 minutes, food was served!  We finished our food in about 30-40 minutes, witnessing how other customers were served professionally.  We walked out with a full stomach and satisfaction."
40,"I know everyone is here for the soupy korean minced meat noodle soup and dumplings but i really wanna recommend the bibim cold noodles. Its really delicious with the right amount of spice and ice. Usually the noodles tend to have a ""flour"" taste to it but this one is fragrant and springy. The soupy noodles are a tinge oily so if you like something more clear, its not the best choice."
50,"I’ve been every time I’ve been to Seoul, they only serve dumplings, it’s full of Koreans, very simple but delicious food, and easy enough to order as a foreigner as you can literally point at dumplings on menu, and they are absolutely worth having while in Seoul. 10/10."
40,Great quality korean noodles and dumplings... Friends and I enjoyed the dumplings so much! I recommend this to all tourists so that you can experience amazing local food. Affordable too! Came during lunch and it was packed!! Guess its really popular. Dont expect attentive service during rush hour.
50,"They sell dumplings and chicken noodle soup! It is really delicious and affordable. It is a must eat in Myeongdong! The shop is conveniently located in the busy streets of Myeongdong along with the various beauty brands at the 2nd level. For people who are looking for soup and dumplings, this restaurant is definitely recommended!"
30,"One of the must-try-at-all-costs restaurants on my list was Myeongdong Kyoja, a Michelin-awarded restaurant known for its dumplings and noodles so I was pretty much squealing in delight when we got a table. Like Hawker Chan and Tim Ho Wan, Myeongdong Kyoja’s popularity is owed to its affordability; so expect the rush of diners to trickle in until after its official closing time.  Serving sizes were on the bigger side; so my mom and I decided to split an order each of their Chopped Noodles (KRW9000) and Dumplings (KRW10000). Its Dumplings were made of juicy minced Korean pork and leeks laced with sesame oil which were packed in delicate translucent wrappers. Unfortunately, there was nothing spectacular about them. The dumplings elevate in flavor once dipped in their chili-soy sauce; but I’m honestly happier and more satisfied with the Mandu we get from local Korean food purveyors like Kaya. The Chopped Noodles came with a hearty chicken broth which was perfect in its chilly weather; but again, it falls flat in terms of character. It was a hearty meal; but I expected more from a Michelin-starred restaurant. Service wasn’t the best and the friendliest either."
40,"The first impression after entering into the restaurant is rather cramped, not very tidy and clean. We were sent to first floor without waiting.  There are just a few choices on the menu and seems that every table order the chef steamed pork dumplings and noodles which we did too. The food came fairly quickly, have to pay upon ordering.  The food quality is good, worth trying if you come to Myeong Dong"
40,I ate Kong-guksu. This menu only we can eat April to September. They use soymilk with white sesame paste. That was little bit sweet and creamy.
50,"They have good food and everything is efficient. You go in, eat and go out. We went there when we were tired after shopping and it was perfect! We got the table, ordered, paid, got our portiones, eat and left. The food was delicious and cheap. Perfect place for us."
40,"Myeongdong Kyo Ja touted as best and only place in Korea you can find this restaurant. Actually there are two locations within this shopping area. Packed with diners there for lunch. We ended up on 3rd floor, elevator for the weary. Very very crowded but turnover amazing as not long ( split second, nah.. close though) before food was on our table. Limited choice makes for quick service. In and out! Food was delicious! check it out , ask the red shirted information people who are at every intersection of the shopping area."
40,It’s a popular place. You have to be in line to get in. I like their noodle in hot soup. Thin skinned full filling dumplings are great. Try their noodle and dumplings together. You will like the combination.
20,I think this restaurant is overrated. Dumplings not taste delicious. Cold spicy noodle also not good. The most delicious is the complimentary bowl of soup
50,"We did not want a full meal, but just wanted a quick bite and shared an order of extraordinaryly light and flavorful dumplings. Outstanding! Procedure is you order, pay for your food, and it is delivered very quickly -- and you can always ask for additional kimchi should you need/want more spice and garlic."
50,"Serving a menu of only four dishes, the pork dumplings are world class, the handmade noodles are amazing and the Kimchi is spicy and the spicy noodles are everything in combination. What a place!!!! Must go! I’ll return!"
40,"I felt like a local at this simple restaurant which serves outstanding food in a very baisc setting. We ordered the noodles adn dumplings from the simple menu which was plenty for two. Less that 20,000 KRW (about $AUD25) whcihis padi up front. The service was impersonal but the food was delivered qudkly and efficiently, and is very good, particularly the dumplings. Great for a quick, authrentic and high quality meal."
40,"This restaurant is my wife’s favourite and must visit restaurant. It was crowded at lunch time when we arrived but not difficult to find a small table.  The menu is a simple one, and the process quick & efficient - point at your preferred dishes, order and make payment straightaway. Food arrived shortly in no time.  We’d ordered a basket of 10 pork dumplings and a bowl of sliced noodles. The dumplings was juicy and the meat tasty. The sliced noodles delicious."
50,"The menu has four dishes, and we ordered each one to try. Delicious dumplings. Excellent cold noodle soup (kkong-guk-su). Comforting hot noodle soup (kal-guk-su). Flavorful spicy cold noodle (bibim-guk-su). It’s an experience and worth the visit!"
50,These dumplings were the best I’ve had here in Seoul! And the long noodles ... my first ever Michelin Star rating restaurants and it did not disappoint! The menu is very simple and you pay before you get your food. They do not serve alcohol. It’s a keep it simple process and they move quick! Definitely recommend as we came back for round 2 the last day we departed!
50,The skin is so thin it melts in your mouth! Love the noodles too and we ordered just two bowls of noodles and a serving of dumplings to share for 2 adults and 2 children.
40,"Food was served fast. Immediate payment upon ordering food. The noodles with dumplings cost KRW 9,000. Kimchi was too spicy for my liking."
40,"There are only four dishes the restaurant serves. I tried the noodles with dumplings, which were very tasty. The soup was delicious as well."
20,Though there was many reviews about the place and the crowds it commandeered. If there was a queue or wait for table then do not waste precious time as there are many other similar ramyeon places. It is pricey 9000won per bowl and portion for guys will be a tad inadequate.
40,"Very satisfying and yummy dumplings and spicy cold noodles. We came back twice in once trip, and it hits the spot - very comforting basic food👍👍👍👍"
50,Can’t imagine the noodle taste so nice. Got “wok hey”. Fire smoke taste. Not easy to master. The dumpling is so so. Xiao long bao is nicer. The dry soba is too spicy. Taste also so so
50,"I actually never heard of this place but was very surprised by the line outside, which was mostly tourists. I immediately had two (and later was proven wrong) assumptions - This place must be 1) Very touristy and overly hyped 2) Probably overpriced I was wrong. The food is delicious - One of the best dumplings I had in Korea, and I had a few. Even though it is located in a super touristy area, the food is top notch and NOT overpriced. Go for the dumplings and the noodles, you won't regret it. (Yes, even if it's only breakfast)  TIP - Do not be intimated by the queue line if you come before 10:30 am. It's a two-story restaurant, and the service is lightning fast. When they open up, the whole crowd was comfortably seated inside in less than a minute."
40,The location is pretty easy to locate within the busy streets of Myeongdong. The noodle and the mandu undoubtedly very delicious. Must try if you are in the area!
50,"We came twice! The 2nd time, we ordered 4 portion of dumplings (each portion has 10 fat yummy dumplings) for the 4 of us and the server kept asking if we ordered correctly :)  The price was also very reasonable and they gave free soup and rice. Service was quick and attentive. Definitely recommend to come here!"
50,"To me , I personally love their chopped noodle soup! Went there for dinner 2 days straight and wish to be back on the 3rd day but we had other dining places in mind.  Service is rather not too friendly but brisk. Food is on the table 5 mins upon ordering. Noodles are served warm , might be alil slippery to eat but oh so yummy to your tummy. Had the dumplings too which was also delicious. But my favourite would really have to be that bowl of heart warming soul chopped noodle soup.The perfect combination to be eaten during winter. Am craving for it now!  **Try it yourself and tell the tale as everyone has their own taste and preference"
40,"Service was brisk. We were shown to our table upon arrival and ordered the 3 things in their menu - a pork noodle, spicy cold noodle and dumplings. They did their dumplings really well, the skin is thin and the meat is tasty inside. The cold spicy noodles was quite spicy so, I preferred the pork noodles more."
40,"I came for a late lunch around 1pm on a Sunday, there was no wait. I was guided to sit downstairs. Service is no nonsense and brisk. They run this bustling eatery like a well oiled machine. You’re expected to know what you want and pay simultaneously as soon as you sit down. I took my time, didn’t allow them to rush me; a menu was thrown down beside me when I didn’t speak up to order fast enough. I ordered the chopped noodle soup. It came out less then 5 minutes later. The soup had noodles, dumplings, minced meat and caramelized onions in it. This soup was amazing! Definitely NOT overrated and should not be missed."
40,"A small, no frill restaurant in the middle of Myeongdong shopping street. Wellknown for the cold buckwheat noodles, but the spicy noodles are for us tastier. The dumplings also very tasty. Worth a try if in the shopping area anyway."
30,"I’ve been here a few times over the years Five years ago it was great but the standard has dropped significantly Soup was lukewarm and staff were somewhat rude, particularly to foreigners. Dumplings were scrawny and dish was overpriced"
50,Very local very Korea restaurant !! Food is good service is ok good for local and for tourists too !! If you want something quick and easy this is a place!!
30,"When we arrived we were immediately told to go upstairs quite aggressively with no explanation, but it was clear we were not welcome to sit downstairs. About 30 seconds after being seated upstairs, we were suddenly told to move to another table by one staff member as a larger family had come in and needed our four-seater table - fine by us, but we were rather manhandled out of the way. Service was extremely quick which was great, but the dumplings were a big disappointment. We had gone to the restaurant based on Trip Advisor reviews, but we found them quite tasteless and bland. The hot noodles were a little better, but certainly nothing special. The price was cheap, so I can’t really complain about the quality of the food, but during our stay in Seoul we tried much better restaurants in the area for a similar price, but with much tastier food! Unfortunately we would certainly not return based both on the staff and blandness of the food."
50,"Service was fast. Had noodles and dumplings, both of which were excellent; kimchi was also excellent."
30,"We went to this restaurant for brunch, being foreigners, we were asked to occupy a table on the second floor even if many of the ground floor tables were available. We did not like this, we were discriminated. We insisted on staying at the ground floor. There are only 4 menu items. The dumplings were really good. The other dishes just okay. The restaurant is not very clean. We saw a cockroach on the restaurant floor that no one minded. I heard that this is a michelin star restaurant, i dont think they deserved that."
40,"Their serving is very fast. See the picture, order and pay. Go to your seats and the dishes are served.The noodle is springy and the soup is good in cold weather. The dumpling is delicious too. Will need to wait about 15mins during peak period."
50,This was very good food with good and quick service. Almost everyone had ordered the same thing. The noodle soup and the dumpling.
50,"Very clean and efficient place. You pay beforehand and get your order very quickly. Ordered the noodle soup. It was great and the portion was very big. Luckily the noodle soup still had some of the famous dumplings inside. Furthermore, turnover is very fast so no long wait to get a table."
50,"Except the minimal yet the best. Only 3 dishes in the entire menu; Hot Noodle Soup (great piece), Dumplings (very very good ones) and soybean noodle (cold, didn't try it) We came in the afternoon, there was not queue yes it was crowded with locals. Food was delicious and really value for money"
50,"They only sell 3 items - handmade noodle in hot soup (fantastic, my fav) , dumplings and soybean noodle (cold item, didn’t order). Long queue but turnaround fast and many locals went there. Simple, value for money but highly recommended."
40,This noodle house is one of the lamd mark restruants in myungdong for more than 30years with reasonable price . Their dumpling is also good. Sometimes very crowd
40,"Had lunch on rainy day in mid April 2019. Service was very efficient and food arrived at lightning spend.  We had standard Kalkooksu and steamed dumpling. There was nothing special about the food, mostly location and name value.  If must have lunch at Myoungdong then go ahead, otherwise head to Gwangjang markets for better and variety."
50,It's a must stop for each Seoul trip. It's comfort food for all seasons. Service is efficient and food is served as soon as you placed the order.
40,"Famous dumplings in Seoul. Dipped in white vinegar, it resembles Chinese dumplings from San don. The noodles are very smooth cut noodles, with plain pork base soup, a little thicker than normal. It includes zucchini, onions, black fungus, mince meat and chives. Again, strong resemblance of chinese hand made noodles. The difference is it is served with kimchi. At the end, you can order some rice and mix it with the soup. If you like simple foods away from the BBQ and fried stuff, here is the restaurant to balance things out. Don’t forget the extra mints at the end to get rid of the chives breath!!"
40,"This is a Michelin shop in Myeongdong shopping district selling famous dumplings very delicious beside dumplings you can order others dish, service fast and good don’t just look at the small entrance but inside is big and spacious most important is the foods. Remember again which I had mentioned eating in Korea any restaurant big or small there is no 20% service and 7% gst tax not in Singapore ok"
50,"This is comfort food on chilly days. Shared the noodle and dumplings with my dad. Portion of the noodle is on the big side. If you are small eater like us, suggest you share them between two. Service is fast and you pay after you order."
40,Dumplings don’t come much better than at this extremely popular restaurant in the heart of Seoul’s shopping area! My wife and I shared dumplings and a couple of smaller dishes. Each one packed full of flavour and just so damn good!
40,"My daughters and I were on our first visit to Korea, guided by my wife who had previously been there a couple of times. She kept on nagging us to eat at a restaurant called kyoja. We were walking around Myeong Dong and finally found it. It was like the usual crowded asian noodle fast food. When the food came, it was good. The dumplings had this distinct subtle flavor and the broth of the soup was just right for me. Although my kids loved the spicy orders, I liked it better plain. I didn’t expect that. Simple looking place...awesome good food."
40,"A large restaurant without any pretension. No fancy service, tablecloths or anything else, just great noodles and dumplings with refillable kimchi.  Very few non-Koreans when we were there so the menu is geared to local rather than tourist tastes. No hesitation in saying that we will be back in our relatively short stay in Seoul.  Less than $US 25 for three people. Plenty to eat. There are three branches of the restaurant within about 100 metres, the one we went to was the largest."
50,"Yummy noodles with soup and dumplings! When we were there, there was no queue. Definitely will go back again if we are back in Seoul again"
50,The signature dish hot noodle was very tasty but what made the food more special was the Kim chi they provided with. The cold spicy noodle was also very tasty. Place is busy and you may need to wait but no more than 5 mins since the restaurant is very big.
40,"If you like soupy noodles and meat dumplings (korea style), this is a popular place with tourists and locals. Service is efficient and food is nice. Personally, I don't fancy dumplings but most of my friends love the dumplings here."
20,"After being ushered into the restaurant, we sat at a table for 4 persons. An elderly waitress came in and asked us to sit on another table for no apparent reason. When our food arrived, she just rudely shoved the foods onto our table. While the foods were tasty but the service was deplorable. We will not go back to this restaurant."
40,do not miss it if you stayed in myeongdong. Taste is so so but good to try it out big portion so recommend one dish for two
50,This is one of those places that you just have to go and order one of each from the 5 items on the menu. Chopsticks are in the drawer. You pay right after you order. Good come out fast and hot! You will not regret. There is more than one in Myeongdong. I don’t think that it matters which.
50,Tried the dumplings only and I was blown away by the dumplings! The dumpling skin was translucent and really thin so there was a generous amount of filling. The dumpling in general was really juicy and the fresh pork and vegetables go together so well. It is great eaten during a meal and even when eaten alone as a snack! Will definitely patronise again because I really love the dumplings! A must try when visiting Korea!
50,"I have eaten here a few times over the last few years and the dumplings are consistently tasty and juicy. The hand cut noodles are really smooth and the garlic in the kimchi sets it apart from other kimchi. At KWR10,000 per serving, this place provides good value. And you can even pack the dumplings to go in sealed and air tight containers along with kimchi in separate sealed containers. These takeaways have survived a flight for me on a couple of occasions."
20,I've been to this place 4 times over 7 years and I can say that it is the most overrated food place in Seoul.  The dumplings and noodle are not al dente nor particularly flavorful.  I've had far superior versions in divey joints across Korea and China. How this place gets this rating I have no idea. I'm Korean-American and have relatives in both Korea and China and traveled extensively in both countries. This has got to be the most overrated of all noodle/dumpling joints. I'm not a fan of Din Tai Fung either. None of these places makes their noodles or dumplings chewy enough. If you're a fan of limp noodles and dumplings or use dentures then this is the place for you.
50,"A lot of restaurants around Korea claim that they are or sell Myeongdong Kalguksu. Well, this is the ORIGINAL Myeongdong Kalguksu. The one and only Michelin Award Kalguksu. So many copycats that the restaurant changed their name to Myeongdong Gyoja. This is the one and only restaurant for the original Kalguksu. Rumor has it that they opened a second shop in Itaewon. Every other “Myeongdong Kalguksu” is an impostor.  If your traveling to Myeongdong and want some beef broth noodles, this is the spot. This is a must for any traveler hitting up Myeongdong. Weekends are going to be packed so go at an odd time of the day if your going on the weekend.  Note 1) Prepay. A lady will take your order then hand her your card or cash. She’ll give you your receipt and a piece of gum. Save the gum for the end of the meal. The kimchi is super garlicky.  You’ll get a side of kimchi. Warning, the kimchi is super garlicky and a bit spicy, but not unbearably spicy. There’s a hint of ginger in the kimchi but like I said, super garlicky. Goes great with the noodles. There’s free refills on the kimchi just flag down the waitress.  If you don’t order the steamed gyoja (mandu) don’t worry. You’ll get a few small pieces in your noodles. Take a look at my pics I uploaded.  The noodles are definitely fresh and machine made and not frozen packaged. The soup is absolutely delicious. The waitress will give you a small bowl of rice. I like to mix my left over soup with my rice.  Note 2) Extra noodles and or a bowl of rice are free of charge so eat until your heart is content... or until the waitress says no!  The gyoja is good but it’s not the main despite the name change. I also like to enjoy the gyoja with a piece of kimchi.  Note 3) There’s mouthwash in the bathroom. Use it because the kimchi is super garlicky.  I’m not a Kalguksu guy because I don’t enjoy all the sea food that goes in it but Myeongdong Gyoja doesn’t use sea food so it’s perfect for me. Ground beef and veggies in the soup. I highly recommend this spot if you’re in the area looking for Korean style noodles."
30,"Another one of those famous restaurants which I have passed by for years. Long lineups always made me curious just how good is this “good restaurant”? How good are the noodles? So a few weeks ago, while in Myeongdong, I decided to give it a try. I got their galguksu noodle dish as this was the one that stood out most in pictures. The noodles were nice and chewy and soft while the broth was very rich both in taste and texture. The serving is huge, as a matter of fact both my friend and I couldn’t get through this one dish. The price, of course great - under 10,000 won for this huge noodle dish is a bargain. It was good, but not great; and I must say I have had definitely better galguksu dishes before. I guess what I am trying to say is that perhaps I was a little disappointed or my expectations were too high. The place was packed, so perhaps it is me who wasn’t too satisfied, but I am glad I have finally had a chance to try it out. Will I go back? Hmm, probably not ~ as I would like to try other galguksu restaurants in the future."
50,You can have unique Korean style noodles either cold and warm recipe served. Dumpling is another which is different from Chinese style in its bun filling inside. Very much quick service when you order the dishes.
50,Would have walked past this restaurant several times if not for the recommendation of a local friend. The noodles are chewy & broth are bursting with meaty flavor. I suggest coming with a very empty stomach as the serving is huge! Your empty stomach will ensure that you can eat the delicious meat dumpling. Come to the restaurant before the peak dining time as the queue can be quite long. The only restaurant that would want me to come back for again.
50,"Very fast service and very packed place. Only 1 main dish here, so order it and get more noodles or dumplings if you are a big eater. Food comes almost immediately after you sit down and payment is quick. Lunch finished within 15 minutes and out we went. Food costs around 9000 won per pax"
50,Yummy noodles and dumplings at affordable prices! The kimchi was real spicy but goes well with the noodle...👍
50,"We had awesome dumplings and noodles here, and the price was really good. And our food came out really quickly :-)"
40,"I had my first meal in Seoul here. Soothing comfort food, and a short walk from my hotel through a fun neighborhood. The service was highly efficient and the food was very good."
40,"Your choice is limited here: noodles and/or dumplings, but the quality of both items is amazing. This will definitely warm you up when it’s cold outside."
50,I love the noodles and the dumplings at this restaurant! they only serve very limited choices but they are superb :) and very fast service. Highly recommended to try in the middle of the busy Myeongdong in the cold winter..
40,Mandu dumplings and chopped noodles seemed to be our favorite items and this restaurant specializes in these dishes. Restaurant actually feels more cafeteria style and requires payment immediately after ordering before the food is served. Decent and well priced establishment.  We knocked off a star as the kimchi seemed to have a weird chemical taste.
50,"This little restaurant is in the busy Myeongdong district and is just one of the multitude of store-fronts in this busy area crowded with shops and F&B outlets. It is quite unassuming - and then you realised that the menu has only 4 items - soup noodles, dumplings, cold noodles and cold porridge. That's it....if you want something else, you gonna have to go somewhere else. We ordered only the hot noodle soup and dumplings, and it more than filled us for dinner. The noodles was good, and is a big serving.  The dumpling is big, and the filling is very generous and full of port. The skin is thin and translucent - a sign of great skills on the part of the chef.  It also comes with unlimited kimchi at no additional charge!  For the price, it is the best I have ever tried and that includes a world-renowned dumpling chain founded in Taiwan and now gone international with a Top 10 selection by the New York Times."
40,"The menu was simple, the service was quick, the food was adequate. I sat down, ordered and paid right away. Within 1 minute I had food on my table. It was a good place for a quick bit."
50,Food comes out so fast I wasn't even done paying and the food was already out. The kimchi is really good but will leave a garlic taste in your mouth all day
40,"There are only 3 items on the menu. Dumplings - very thin skin, huge portion. Noodles - hot soup noodles with small wontons and mince pork. The noodles were so light and fluff. Cold noodles - with spicy sauce. Didn’t enjoy this so much as it was too spicy for me and we didn’t realise it was a cold dish. 28,000 won for all three dishes. Full and satisfied. Very efficient service."
40,I love noodle soups. It's like a kind of comfort food for me. I went to myeongdong kyoja after a full day of skiing. There are only 4 items in the menu. I had the steamed dumplings and chicken noodle soup. Both were delicious. It's a good break after eating heavy BBQ meats and spicy stew for a few days. The service was super fast. It is a good option if you want a quick and decent meal.
50,"As with all god restaurants, the crowd builds up on the street before the doors open. But it is so worth the wait. I went two days in a row, and I'm missing it already. Menu is limited, just go for the kalgaksu and mandu. Portion may look big, but don't bother to share cos once you dig in you'll want all to yourself!"
50,"Distinct and easy to order from menu, the kyoja was absolutely delicious within a big bowl or delicious noodles. Highly recommended!"
50,Efficient ushers will send quickly you to the available tables. Food come quickly and the meal was great and satisfying!
40,"After wandering through the busy streets of Myeondong, a stop in Kyoja was a welcome reprieve from the cold and hustle bustle. The broth and the noodles are great while the mandu are divine. Overall lived up to the hype."
40,"you could never go wrong in this restaurant...quick service, delicious and hot food will be served, affordable price as well (kalgaksu for 8,000won and mandu at 10,000won)"
50,"Noodles and hot soup were fabulous and dumplings very tasty. Fast service, quick easy meal just what you need on a cold Seoul day."
40,"Shop was clean. Service was decent and efficient. The dumplings and the soup noodles were delicious. Definitely worth to try it out. We didn't have to wait too long but I could be because we went at off-peak hours in the afternoon. When we passed by the shop (actually there are 2 shops about 30 to 50 metres apart) later at dinner time, there were queues of diners waiting to get in. One interesting thing that we noted was that the local (Korean) diners kept requesting for refills of rice, noodles and/or soup and it appears to be free-of-charge. We were too full from the initial portions to try the same orders."
40,"Saw a lot of locals streaming in & decided to try. Did not disappoint. Only 4 dishes on menu if I recall correctly. 3 types of noodles (2 cold 1 hot) and dumplings. Hot noodles was very flavourful, extremely comforting on a cold day. Dumplings had very thin “skin” & full of fillings. Two thumbs up! Kimchi was a little to heavy on garlic for my liking though."
50,"I happened to pass this restaurant at lunch time and it is usually a good sign when there are people waiting. As I was dining solo, there was no waiting time. I shared the table with a local lady and ordered what she was having the noodles (Kalguksa 8000 won). It came with a side of kimchi (replenished) and I later offered some rice. Good atmosphere and the food was delicious and satisfying. Would recommend."
50,It was crazily insane when I saw the long queue. Went again on another day during off peak hours. Food was great indeed without having to queue for the delicious food. Enjoyed the sides such as in house special kimchi with lots n lots of garlic.. Luckily candy chewing gum were given to clean your palate and garlic smelling breath.. Noodles texture is springy and the mandus were filled to a sufficient size. Satisfying meal..
40,"Pay on the spot after ordering, and your dish will be served within the next 3-5 minutes. Ordered the Chopped Noodles in Chicken Broth and Mandu with minced pork, which did not disappoint."
50,"Located right in the shopping area, the place is big and has 3 floors. They got famous because of their Michelin star - so expect the line and tourist crowd. The food was good and experience was nice at that price point. If you are in the area and not in a rush - should try! I got there at 2:30pm and got a table right away!"
50,"There are only 4 items on the menu, which shows that they have been doing the same thing forever. We didn't try the soy bean noodles, just the soup noodles and the dumplings.The skin of the dumplings were thin and perfectly cooked.  Despite this being on every food blog, we didn't have to wait and the service was very quick. It was definitely worth the hype."
50,"On our visit to South Korea Korea summer I coined this place as Somewhere to definitely go on our journey. I was not disappointed the food was great ,and my mother even enjoyed it being a person who is not too fond of ramen. We had a serving of the ramen and an order of dumplings. The flavor is still very memorable and would love to eat there again."
30,Dine at the restaurant at about 6pm on a weekend. Was seated immediately. Would expect a queue if went later. There were only 4-5 items on the menu. Order the handmade noodles and kyoja. The broth of the noodles was flavourful and the dumplings was not bad too. Price was reasonable. Give it a try while at Myeong-dong.
50,"Great food. Although only 4 items on the menu. They were done very well. The kyoja skin is tasty and skin is so thin, not sure how they made them."
40,Dumplings and noodles tastes good :-) extra rice was just a spoonfull size but unlimited. Takes effort to request and have it sent to table.
30,"Ate here in December 2018 with my friends. Service was standard and food was good. Nothing too exciting to write about, other than I would go there again. Parking may be an issue so taxi/public transportation may be best."
30,"We were walking around Myeongdong and did not intentionally look for it but we just chanced upon it. It wasn’t too crowded probably because it was after lunch hours at about 2.00pm.  There wasn’t much on the menu, and we ordered the noodles soup and the dumplings. Although there was much recommendations about this Myeongdong Kyoja, and had Michelin bib, we didn’t find it extremely good. It was just probably good and not something to rave much about. The meal wasn’t expensive, so just give it a try if you get to see it."
50,"The Grand Hotel staff recommended this place for warm soupy noodles after we arrived. There are 2 outlets in Myeongdong.  Place was crowded and you basically have to share tables. Hubby and I tried the soup noodles (Kaiguksu) and the steam meat dumplings (Mandu). It is really tasty and you can just hear patrons happily slurping up the noodles. Total bill KRW 28,000. After having this I don’t think I will eat the dumplings from Din Tai Fung anymore. Suggested to my son who is studying there to try and his comments ‘Just out of this world’  Try it yourself and be hooked."
50,"This restaurant is only serve 4 menu. Yes, 4. I like the noodles and dumplings.The kimchi taste is too strong for me. I add a liitle to the noodle soup, then it's prefect. Open since 1966."
40,"We can here on a recommendation from a friend and we arrive here around 6pm on a Wednesday evening. That’s very fortunate for us as we did not have to wait very long for our party of 10.  The menu comprised of only 4 items: dumplings, noodle soup, cold soya noodles and a spicy noodle. Once you are seated and ordered (and paid), the dishes will arrive in a jiffy. The noodle soup and dumplings are a “must try”.  Seating is cramped and you are not expected to stay to chat after your meal, as the restaurant wants a quick turnaround. This is obvious based on the service and the long queue that build up as we left the restaurant. Definitely recommended for a visit."
40,"Myeongdong Kyoja has really good food that is pretty affordable (e.g a big bowl of noodles was only 8,000 KRW- cheaper than some food courts in Seoul!). The Mandu was really yummy! The service is also very efficient and our food arrived quickly after we ordered. The only downside is that the menu is pretty limited with only one option for our vegetarian Friend, so that’s some you’d need to take into consideration if you have someone in your group that doesn’t eat meat. The place also isn’t somewhere you would probably stay for hours to chat as it’s very popular and thus crowded. However we still really enjoyed our meal and the food was very good!"
40,"Local flavours very close to heart. Soupy noodles and dumplings with a side of kimchi. Seeing how the locals eat, makes the experience so homely."
30,"Came here for my first lunch in Seoul. Very limited option in their menu like 4-5 items probably. Their signature noodles is okay, dumplings are good. I’d say it’s a normal healthy meal but won’t regret if didn’t try it."
50,"The restaurant has really tangy and delicious noodles and soup. They also serve delicious dumplings. However, there isn’t much else on the menu. They don’t serve any other drinks apart from cold water which is placed at your table."
50,The noodles and dumplings very nice especially in a cold weather. They only have 6 dishes in the menu. And services are fast though the staff cannot really speak English. It is a good place to fill up your stomach with a cheap n good meal.
40,We tried 1 spicy noodle & 1 tray of Kyoza Delicious & generous potion for 3 pax. Spicy noodle is Super hot for us. Make sure to order in lesser chilli paste if you are not a dare devil chilli lover.
50,"Simple menu with only four meals, but cooked with passion. Great taste and buzzing atmosphere in the restaurant."
50,"I was staying in Myeongdong and there were two locations of this Michelin Bib Gourmand eatery within a couple blocks of each other. I was exhausted after a flight from Seattle, very hungry and wandered in and had one of the best bowls of noodle soup, if not the best, in my entire life. I was too full to try the mandoo so I just came back another day. The food was so good I would have been totally happy eating here and nowhere else for my entire trip to Seoul. Great kimchi as well. Yum!!"
40,"There were only 3 dishes to choose from and we ordered all 3 - dimsum, chopped noodles and spicy noodles. The dimsum serving was big and can be shared by 4-5 people. The chopped noodles bowl was also big and could be shared by 2 people but we did not know that so we ended up ordering individual bowls and we could not finish them. Our son ordered both the chopped noodles and the spicy noodles and he said both were good but the spice level of the spicy noodles was really high. The only downside was the kimchi served as an appetizer as it was not really good."
50,This place is always packed. We were lucky to get a table as soon as we arrived. Try the noodle soup and the mandu. Its delicious!
50,Must eat in Myeongdong. It's easy to find and it's delicious. They only serves 3 or 4 menu I think. I order the noodles and the mandu. And I must say that the mandu is really delicious
10,"This restaurant is always fully customers. So you need to join strangers. They use a table for 4 person but customer always requested joining. Old staff is so rude. This restaurant is so crowded and noisy. (Don't go with children) Many people said, ""I'm eating in war"". I think noodle is delicious a little (frankly korea has good restaurants) I don't wanna go there again. Never. Plus, if you use pay service(except plastic real credit card) you can pay on next year. Cashier told me, ""we are so busy! Just stay!"" But if you don't pay, you can't see your food. Because this restaurant has prepaid system. Fxxk. 무슨 한글만 글자로 취급해!? 영어는 그림이냐? 무슨 한글만 글자로 취급해!? 영어는 그림이냐? 무슨 한글만 글자로 취급해!? 영어는 그림이냐?"
40,Only 4 menu so it easy to choose. Had the mando and spicy noodle. Choose pay and eat. And you can leave when your finish
50,"Michelin recommended restaurant. Enough said. Many customers yet waiting time is short. Only 4 items available on the menu. All also worth trying, especially the dumplings. Thumbs up!"
30,After eating beef bulgogi for what seemed like five days straight it was a nice change to have the noodles and dumplings both of which were good. The dumplings better than the noodles overall. The place has two floors which is nice because it is packed but the turn over seems quick enough. If in the area I would go again.
50,"3 of us went there for dinner, it was full of customers but the table turnover is so fast so we don't have to wait long even though dinner time is full of customers. Service is very fast too, if you can make your order right after you sit down, your food will takes around or less than 5 mins to arrive. No need to worry about what to order because you can order the whole menu...there are only 4 items and 1 is unavailable. By the way, please ready your money as they will collect your payment before they serve you the food."
40,"Just across the hotel, one of the Long queue eateries in Myeong Dong.  There is only 4-5 items on their menu.  And I believe everyone one of them is good.  We had the dumpling and noodle soup, even my Daughter finished her share.  Recommended time to visit, off peak hours, before 11.30am, after 3 before 5pm."
40,This place seems to be very local and populated by local people. I had the noodles and they were delicious.
40,"After tasting the Kalguksu in this restaurant, I never dared to try other as they might seem disappointing after tasting this one. Not really a fan of noodle soup dish, but I really liked this especially after walking in the cold streets of Myeongdong. Good and fast service  Highly recommended if you want a real meal after shopping around Myeongdong and wanting a sit down dinner or a break from the street foods offered around the area."
40,"Generally, the recipe was maintained. The dumplings were fine, not fantastic though. The cold noodles was great and the soy bean noodles is a must try."
20,"I like the dumplings and kimchi there, however, there were too many tourists and local people waiting in line outside to get inside of the restaurant. The tables are small and too close to neighborhood tables too, and chairs are uncomfortable to stay longer. The dumpling taste good but I prefer to go other dumpling restaurants. Think the meat type of dumpling and noodles are not my type because I prefer vegetables more."
40,Went to this restaurant after seeing the recommendation from trip advisor and it doesn't disappoint.Food is really delicious and service is fast.
50,"The Kalguksu noodles were so good that we came & ate twice. Served in a huge bowl & piping hot, just the way I loved!  The mandu was just average & pricey for me though... The kimchi is the spiciest I've ever tasted.  Surprising that there are actually 3 floors, so service was brisk & fast!"
50,"I must say that this is one of the best restaurant in Myeongdong area and a must visit for you guys who visited Myeongdong! Do note that there are 2 locations (one near Myeongdong Cathedral and the other one close to a Myeongdong Station). The dumpling is the star dish of the restaurant, me and my family really enjoyed our time there. We tried both of the dumplings and noodles, the portion is quite big (fulfilling food indeed). Please beware that queues can be a hassle during lunch or dinner time, so come early before people rushing to get a meal."
40,Need to go earlier as this is one of the tourist and local hot spot there. I like their cold noodle and gyoza.
50,This is a very simple yet very real culinary experience of korean food. If you want to taste some traditional food and pay a fair price come here
50,"We came and had the noodle and wonton soup and the dumplings. The soup was tasty, but the dumplings stole the show. I would go back again for sure."
50,"A repeated visit to enjoy the consistently good kyoja and the wonderfully pungent and garlicky potent kimchi. Never fails to impress. This time I ordered the cold buckwheat noodles. The server will offer to cut the noodles when the noodles arrive. This is great considering the chewy texture of the noodles. The noodles were cold, very refreshing, and was drenched in a cold slightly spicy sauce. It came with a small bowl of warm broth which was extremely flavourful and comforting. All in all, another enjoyable visit to this restaurant."
50,Best noodle and dumpling soup and mandu. The restaurant is busy but the line up goes pretty fast. Must try!
30,"We came for an early bowl of noodles and steamed dumplings as our hotel room wasn't ready on our arrival in Seoul, arriving pretty much after it opened and the place was relatively busy already. We were shown to a table upstairs but didn't feel particularly welcomed. We ordered our food and found chopsticks in the draw in the table. Food came served in plastic dishes which was rather odd. It tasted good enough - dumplings particularly, but the service was a let down. A good option if you are in a hurry and want some tasty, fast food."
50,"Very fast and efficient service, delicious dumplings (menu was simple - one type of dumplings and 3 types of noodles). The kimchi come for free and is very garlicky compared to the store bought kind. Would recommend."
50,"We were staying in Myeongdong area and found this place. They serve really good food - the noodles were rich, mandoo (dumplings) were amazing!! Best dumplings I've had so far I can say and they serve free unlimited kimchi and rice too. This place is usually packed and really have long waiting lines. Make sure to go early when there's no line yet! Would be back on my next visit."
50,The places specialises in 4 dishes but it's a favourite amongst locals and tourists. The Michelin bib they are awarded with is well worth the queues that will form during meal times. I have noticed that many locals come to have the soup noodles (kalguksu). it has very well textured noodles and a great broth with a great balance of meat inside. The dumplings (mandu) comes as a set of 10 well steamed and it pairs very nicely with the sauce. The kimchi that accompanies the dish has a very spicy taste to it and it complements the dishes very well. Highly recommended.
50,Well in this place the Kalguksu is really popular and you also need to wait in line for eating here. You can ask for more noodle or rice in here. It’s free. The kimchi in here is good but spicy. So please be careful when you try the kimchi :)
40,"To me, good food and service is important.  This was our first meal in Seoul, and the ladies who served try to explain why we can't sit together. And i was telling them it's fine to split us up since it's crowded.  The food was ordered and served fast. And knowing that we have kids, they give us the extra bowls.  Enjoyed my meal! Gamsahamnida  Also there is lift within the restaurant, esp when u travel with elderly, they cant climb the stairs, This restaurant is good for families!"
50,"We usually don’t like to eat at the same restaurant twice when we’re traveling because there’s so much to explore and so little time. However, our group of 6 had to come back here one last time before we left South Korea. It was that good!  The menu is limited and the service is without frills. They make up for it with delicious food.  **Get the hot noodles (and dumplings)!**  Skip the cold noodles, if you think you think you’ll be full; they weren’t memorable."
40,Very good dumplings and service is quick. Did not manage to order the noodle dishes but definitely will come back to try!
50,The kalguksu we tried here was one of our favourite meals during our time in Seoul and the dumplings were great. We came here on a recommendation and the restaurant is very popular. The restaurant has multiple floors and was pretty busy when we came in the evening. Service was quick however.
30,"Miss this when I was in Seoul last winter, so this time round, told myself that I must give it a try. Went in on a Fri noon slightly before lunch break and fortunately no q. It was a 3 storey high building. Soon, the whole place was full of people and a long q was formed. The menu was simple with only 4 dishes, the original noodles, the kimchi one, the soy bean one and dumplings. We ordered 3 bowls of original and 1 plate of dumplings. I would say I'm not sure of the hype and this dish is not my cup of tea. Anyway the portion is huge and we cannot finish it, the dumplings are nice though."
40,"Went here due to good reviews and great location near our hotel. Didnt have to wait - although have seen queues here before. Service very friendly and quick. Only serves four dishes. Beaware 2 are hot 2 are cold! Wife had their famous Kalguksu (8000) - hot noodles, meat and dumplings , very good. I had the spicey noodles and was surprised they were cold ( by design). They were very good , nice and spicy. Kimchi nice and strong. (8000). You pay when you order at the table. You wont spend long deciding what drink to have with your meal.........its provided for you .......cold water. They do nothing else. Over all very good."
50,"This is a must try in Myeongdong! The dumplings are super yummy. Thick skin with rich fillings. The soup noodle is super nice. Can't get enough of the soup. The noodle is soft yet chewy.  This is a pretty busy restaurant with quite a number of locals in the queue as well. But the table turnover is fast and food is serve very quickly. Went during lunch time and the wait is not too long, say 10-15min or less."
50,"I was lucky to have a friend living in Seoul take me here because as a tourist, I would have otherwise of missed this place! Apparently people all over Korea come to this historical restaurant because of their Kalguksu and I soon realized why. So delicious!! Even my picky eater 8 year old son loved it. The Mandu shouldn’t be missed either. Can’t wait to go back next time I’m in Seoul."
50,So I am normally vegetarian but I had to try these dumplings... they are excellent. As our the noodles. I don’t typically like these noodles in Los Angeles k-town restaurants or those kits from Korean markets.  These noodles are VERY TASTY and the dumplings are different than the ones in the noodle soup—also very tasty.  One caveat is if you are going here with a date or meeting with people... the sauces have A LOT of garlic. Eat these solo or if your partner(s) don’t care about garlic.
50,"We were street walking on Myeongdong street mall. It's like a maze full of cosmetic, clothing, quick bites and dessert.  We happened to bump into this and it's shown Michelin award 2018. The locals just stream in the door. At 1.30pm it's about 80% full.  Though they have a minimalistic menu. Their main the pork mince noodle soup is a must have. And dumpling is must have too. Once order, pay first and we got served fresh and hot is less than a minute.  Happy with our first lunch and first visit to Seoul. We are planning for 4 nights stay."
50,"Just a few items to chose from. No frills just great food! Michelin rated but very affordable. During Winter, expect Long queue."
40,"I was expecting a line because I’ve heard so much about this place but luckily there wasn’t and it was around 7pm on a Monday night.  You order (Eng menu available) and pay first. Utensils are in your table drawer, right in front of you. They also have free kimchi that this lady keeps coming around to fill up. The dumplings were good, minimum ten, I couldn’t finish them all so I just got them to go afterwards. Noodles were good, broth was thick and so tasty. This place to the main intersection."
40,The restaurant has a short menu which means that they focus on their core specialities. I had dumplings and it was for me a first time in Korea to have dumplings with a thin skin. Till today I only had these at TTF in Taipei. They are not the same though. I do like the dumplings and will visit again
50,"Decided to go for a simple dinner after 6+ hours of flight; and visiting Myeonydong Kyoja (main) turned out to be a good choice. A resturant with limited choice of items in the menu but the food is delicious and price is reasonable. My husband and myself shared a bowl of their specialty noodles and dumplings. The dumplings are juicy, the noodles is chewy and the soup is tasty. Service is fast and staff is friendly. We simply love it."
20,"Just wonder why there’s a long queue on this restaurant. We tried kyoja which is nice but the cold noodles with sweet soup smell like beans and nuts, taste quite terrible. We skipped the noodle and felt quite disappointed. Maybe Korean people love it but don’t know why."
40,"Last visit was in 2016. Same location but slightly renovated.  Menu has only 4 items: 3 types of noodles n the dumplings.  I came back for their spicy noodles.  Overall food quality is excellent. Only didn't quite get used to the kimchi as the taste was a tad strong for me.  As a foreigner it was not difficult to order as they had an English menu plus with only 4 items, it was also not difficult to just point to what you want.  Point to note is that you would have to pay for your food when ordering."
50,This is one of my favourite restaurants in Seoul since a couple of decades ago! The super spicy Kimchi and the soup noodle (Kalguksoo) paired with the dumplings are just yummmmm
50,I was so happy to visit here again. It has been a number of years and I am glad to know that everything is just as good as before. I love their spicy kimchi. So spicy and good. It goes great with their wonderful kalguksu and madu.
50,"There are two restaurants that are in walking distance of each other. We happened to walk into one that had three stories. We had a group of 7, walked in and they told us to go the 3rd floor. We were able to sit right away. The waitress came and explained what their signature dish was. Their menu was very simple we ordered their traditional soup, spicy seaweed noodle, and dumplings. Once we ordered the food they brought it to our table in literally 2 minutes. This was faster than fast food! As soon as they put the food down they asked us to pay right away. Makes sense since we were able to leave as soon as we were done.  Food was excellent traditional Korean dishes that we don't see in the states. Come here of you want to try traditional Korean food. Quick, simple and mouth watering food."
50,Delicious! One order each of kalguksu and mandu was plenty enough for two adults and teenage girl. One of our best meals in Seoul.
40,We came to this place after seeing a lot of positive reviews and were not disappointed. The service was vey fast and the food tasty and a good size. Did feel a little rushed to leave but no real issue as the food came quickly.
40,"Comforting soup, served very hot. Noodle texture is good too. Strong kim chi though. Big serving. Can serve two for medium eaters."
50,Excellent gyojas. Try it for yourselves to believe it. We went back for seconds when we were in Seoul.
50,"Went there with a friend and was hesitant about what to order but I went for the green noodles which had a soy white base with sesame. They were delicious, I’ve never tried something like it before while in Korea! Price is good and portions are big, plus the service is fast !"
50,"Came here after visiting Namsan Seoul Tower and was starrrvvvinggg. So I was thrilled that there was no line, and they are FAST.  We had 4 people, were seated immediately. 4 items on the menu, we got one of each and paid cash right away. You blink, and the foods on your table. Out the door by 15-20 minutes.  Food was good, I would go back, but I wouldn't wait."
50,There are only 4 dishes but all delicious. You will not have to wait more than a couple of minutes before being eating. Just get sure your couple eats the same. They use a lot of garlic! 😄
40,We headed there after our friend collected us at the airport and we had checked in at our guesthouse in Myeongdong. My friend explained it's very famous and popular and sometimes there is a wait to get in. Thankfully we were shown in promptly and all had noodles - think it was in a meat broth and there were a few small dumplings on the top - and also a basket of steamed dumplings. I would have liked the broth to be more steaming hot but I liked the flavours. My husband was a huge fan of the place. It's quite hidden down an alley so not sure we would have found it without a local!
30,"This place is packed. There are only 4 items on the menu. You pay cash immediately after your order. I don't know why it's so popular. It's nothing extraordinary. Food is good, but nothing to brag about. I wouldn't wait in line for this place. You won't be missing out."
30,"Not bad but overrated. If there is queue, then it is not worth the wait. If you are hungry and there is nothing much to eat in Myeongdong, then worth trying."
40,"This place has been around for many years and expanded to 2 locations within Myeongdong. There is limited menu options, actually only 4 to choose from but all are delicious. Very efficient service, you order, pay and get your food almost immediately."
50,Definitely worth many trips down to get their steamed dumpling and dumpling soup noodle. rich ingredients and strong fragrance. Just order and pay at the same time & food'll be serve very fast. i've yet to try their naengmyeon. gonna try it for next trip!
50,"There is a Michelin sign outside this restaurant, just like so many Hong Kong restaurants and the restaurant was essentially of a similar HK style. The experience: Get in a line before opening at 10:30am. Choose first floor or second floor. Wait to be seated. No English print anywhere, just Korean. Order from 5 items on the wall. Pay first. Enjoy shortly after. We ordered soup dumplings and DimSum which were both made of the same pasta dough cooked to tender perfection. There is soy sauce and vinegar at the table for making your own dumpling dipping sauce. Kimchi is given as a side. The food here was not spicy for the most part. Cost breakdown is about $9-$10/person."
50,"Always come here during my holidays in Seoul. Try it at the start of your trip, as you may want to come back again before you leave. Kalguksu noodles 8,000won and mandoo 10,000won are the most popular very delicious!!"
40,Delicious and tasty. Portion is huge. Restaurant is crowded even at 8.30pm when we visited. Food was served very quickly after we ordered. Didn’t wait Long.
50,"It is a traditional Korean wheat noodle. You should try this with a dumpling and Kim-chi. It could be somewhat spicy, but affordable."
40,"There are only four items in their menu. Dumpling noodle soup, Nengmyeon (spicy noodle dry), Dumpling, and lastly the sesame sauce noodle. We had everything and the best one is the dumpling noodle soup. Soup is slightly thick and savoury. Noodle was chewy. And they gave you extra soup in a small bowl just in case. I dont really recommend the sesame sauce noodle. Its a little bland for my taste, but some people may like it. Portions are quite big. So if you're travelling alone keep that in mind."
40,"It’s a good place for a meal and the noodle soup warms your soul. Best way to start the day but don’t come expecting anything fancy. It’s also in a very accessible location in the heart of Myeongdong, you won’t miss it."
40,Great food. My kids loved the dumplings and noodle soup. Only issue was menu had only 4 items but all were good. Plus the area outside the restaurant was packed with people walking about.
40,I love the food here. The portions are just nice and the dumplings are really good. Had a really satisfying meal here. Would love to go back again.
40,They serve only dumplings and cut noodles (dry or in soup)  Dumplings were good. Meaty and skin is thin. There are sauces on the table. The brownish coloured sauce goes well with the dumplings.  The kimchi has too much garlic and not to many people’s liking. It is supposed to be eaten with the dumplings explained the waitress.
50,"We stayed in myeongdong and wanted to try traditional noodle soup and mandu dumplings.  Service is quick and efficient. Did not have to wait long for the noodles and the soup.  Very affordable. Ingredients fresh. Highly recommended for a quick good meal. There isn't a large choice on the menu, dumplings or noodles only."
40,"Most people went there for their dumpling & traditional noodle soup. The ingredients of the dumpling are fresh & nice. The one that brings comfort is their traditional noodle soup. The broth is tasty & the noodles are smooth & “chewy”, with 2 big nice tasty dumpling. Service is fast & prompt. Affordable simple yet tasty Korean food. Restaurant always bustling with people."
50,They had about 3 (or 4) types of noodle (I think only the chopped noodle are hot and the rest are cold noodle). The chopped noodle is great and I like the soup base. The other cold noodle taste good too (I like the spicy noodle too). The main attraction here is the kyoja (dumpling) and it met my standard of “delicious”. Food is worth the money too and the portion is huge! But the downside is their service. We came as a big family and their staff asked us to go to the third floor (close) and the staff on that floor wasn’t keen to open the section and asked me down to second before we settle at the first floor. The serving staff were rather impatient too.
30,Went there to try it because of the review and it was ok. Good but not to my taste. Good noodle soup and dumpling but just not my kind of soup and dumpling. There were queque but it was fast
30,"Much as I like the dumplings here which I had tried during my first visit in 2012, I had never stepped into this eatery for a 2nd time as I was put off by the crowds and long queues that had worsened every year. My friends and I found no queues at around 9pm on a Sunday night and decided to have a late dinner here. Many people were still eating and four of us were herded like school kids to sit in a row at a long table with a partition that separated us from the diners on the other side. Not conducive for our four pax group but the din in the dining hall made it hard to have a decent conversation anyway. The waitress made us place our order the moment we were seated and asked to be paid upfront.  The chilled noodles in soymilk was sold out so we ordered two bowls each of the kalguksu noodle soup and the chilled spicy noodles or bibimguksu, plus an order of the gyoza to share. The food was served within 15 minutes and all four of us agreed that food quality and standards had fallen and not worth the price paid. The kalguksu was served with four flat wontons, some fried minced meat and an unappetizing layer of cooking oil floating above the soup. The bibimguksu was a rip off since it was only shredded cucumber and potent, pungent chilli paste tossed with cold noodles; the hard boiled egg that sits on top of bibimguksu is missing in Myungdung Kyoja's version; the noodles served here were unbearably salty and much too spicy (even for us who usually enjoy robust, spicy food) and had us reaching for iced water. It didn't help when the communal flasks of iced water at our table were almost empty and the waitress took her time to top up the flasks and send them over. The dumplings were good but we detected and discarded bits of stringy bits of tendon or innards mixed into the minced meat filling which was a shame since the eatery's reputation is built on its plump, juicy, unadulterated gyoza. We were done in a hurry and left with bad breath of chilli and garlic as the eatery no longer gives out extra strong mints to diners after their meals."
40,"Only 3 items on the menu - cold noodles, soup and steamed dumplings. Service was very fast. Food was good though the soup was a little salty for my liking. Worth going back again for seconds."
40,"My friends and I stopped by here for a late lunch as we were shopping in Myeongdong. There was no wait fortunately, and we were seated immediately. There were only 4 things on the menu so we decided pretty quickly, but we had to wait a very long time for someone to take our order. They're super busy here (all the other tables were filled) and we had a very difficult time getting their attention and having them come whenever we needed anything - so be prepared for that. We did enjoy the food, though if there was a long line to get seated I would have been just as happy eating elsewhere."
40,"Chanced upon it while shopping in Myeongdong. Service was very fast, no waiting time for a table and food arrived very quickly. Ordered 1 cold noodle, 1 hot soup noodle and 10 dumplings to share (~26K KRW). Portion was too much for 2 people to finish. Hot soup noodle had good texture, soft and tangy, comes with minced chicken and a few dumplings. Cold noodle is slightly spicy. Dumplings were nicely steamed, nicely stuffed with filling and skin wasnt too thick. Overall very satisfied."
20,"Went on a weekday during lunch time. Queue was quite long but we were seated fairly quickly. Noticed that many locals dine there as well. We ordered 3 bowls of the noodle with soup and a dumpling for the 4 of us. Alas, we had almost 2 bowls unfinished. Reasons being the portion was quite big but more because we got sick of the noodle after a few mouthfuls. The dumplings were not too bad. Overall, it’s not our cup of tea."
50,There are only 4 items on the menu (i forgot what they were) so you should prepare what you want to get before going in. The waiter/waitresses are very fast and don’t really have time for you to ponder over the menu at times. You will have to pay for the meal once ordered instead of when you leave the restaurant. Food is really yummy so I will recommend this place! Price is very reasonable as well.
40,"There are 2 branches in Myeongdong but both are equally packed. The queue is fairly fast as they served the food quickly. We ordered the dumpling and noddles which was really fantastic.  The bibim noodles didn't taste spicy at the first few mouths but quickly becomes spicy afterwards. If you are not good at eating spicy food, order the other non spicy noodles instead. Having said so, it was still refreshing and good!"
40,"Located conveniently within touristy Myeongdong area. Restaurant has 3 levels and fully occupied even at 6pm. Very noisy and simply local feel. No reservation I believe.  Menu was simple with only 4 items for ordering- mainly knife noodles (Original, Spicy and Soybean/ each at 8000KRW) and meat dumplings (10000KRW and more delicious than noodles itself). One bowl of noodles obviously enough to feed two persons.  Do give it a try if within vicinity as many Koreans themselves frequent the restaurant."
50,"There are now 2 branches in Myeongdong, both are full with locals and tourists alike. Don't go in expecting a 5 stars service, but it is efficient. On peak hours you might be asked to share a table with strangers. The mandu/gyoza is ultimate comfort food; each dumpling is big and delicious. I will be back!"
40,Man I absolutely loved eating here. When I travel I have this unspoken rule that I don’t eat somewhere twice. Not in Seoul apparently. My husband and I are here and I was so obsessed that I insisted that we go back for dumplings and noodle soup before our flight home. The dumplings are crazy delicious. The wrapper is nearly paper thin and the filling is so flavorful. The noodle soup (I want to say it’s a pork soup) was so so good. I personally wasn’t a fan of the cold noodle dish but my husband absolutely loved them. The menu is approximately four items long and you will be served within moments of ordering. Two orders of dumpling and 1 order of soup was too much food for my husband and I - but I wanted to keep eating.
50,"I was with a business colleague and we were left happy hour on a mission to find this place. Fortunately we did, although we got turned around a few times before we found it. I'm not sure if it was the alcohol, our stupidity, or both, but we roamed the streets on a bitterly cold night for the great meal we had here. The place is on the second floor of a very busy commercial area. Don't give up if you get confused looking for it, the search is worth it. I'm glad we went to happy hour first, because no alcohol is served here. What is served is great dumplings and a wonderful soup. Get both! You will have a great meal."
40,"Didn't realize the menu only had 4 items until I got there, but had to try as it is considered somewhat traditional and locally famous. Had 2 of the 4... dumplings and hot noodle soup which remind me of Korean versions of Xia Long Bao and Dan Dan noodles.  Very fast, good pork & chive dumplings. A little dry, but nonetheless enjoyable.  The hot noodle soup was awesome. Soft, large noodles with ground pork, mushrooms and additional dumplings. Delicious.  Would have tried the cold noodle soup, but the 2 dishes I ordered were already filling for 2 people.  Service was very good and fast. Very casual restaurant. And, cheap!  Definitely worth trying."
40,This place has the best dumplings and kimchi I've tried in Seoul. They also have very good noodle soup. Be sure to be here early as it gets full during lunch hour. They also refill your kimchi bowl upon request.
50,"Brought my family to try out this famous noodles and it sure didn’t disappoint! i am a vegetarian so i can’t speak for the signature noodles. However, my parents, boyfriend and sister were all very impressed. Mum even wanted to down another bowl before we left Seoul! Accordingly to my folks, Dumplings are nice as well. Price is reasonable too!"
40,"We had the Bibimguksu, a cold, mixed noodle dish, which we didn’t care for much. They are well-known for their dumplings, which were very good (compared to the rest…)"
40,"The chilli sauce is really and it really brings out the taste of the cold noodles. Dumplings are good! Overall, good food and very quick service... no fuss and no queue if you are a small group of 2 people."
30,"I have never encountered such efficiency: pay upon ordering immediately after being seated, and the food appears in less than two minutes. The dumplings were good, but we found the famous noodles to be somewhat bland. Ok for a quick lunch, but I would not make a special trip."
30,"Decent food so don't get me wrong. Great that service was quick. Food was so average, I barely even think it deserves a review. Give it a miss if you're familiar with Asian food but if you want a ""safe"" option to try Asian food, please do give it a try."
30,"Great dumplings but the noodles are abit too soft to my liking. Although dumplings were Good, have tasted similar or better ones elsewhere. It's pretty average."
50,Heard alot of gd review of Myeongdong Gyoza. We visited twice because the noodles is too good to be true. It's the best noodle i had tasted so far. You gotta try when you are in seoul.
40,"Only 4 items in the menu,very big portion for the noodles. Packed with people during lunch hours, but queue moving fast. Rushing for time, this is the place cause food serving very fast!"
50,"There are 1 main and 1 branch Myeongdong Kyoja if i remembered correctly. I went to both as i thought the one i went initially was from a competitor, ended up i discovered that both are under the same brand. LOLz  It was cold during my trip in end of April 18, hence it was supposed to be my comfort food. The noodle soup and Dumplings were fabulously good. The dumplings are exceptionally good that i actually went back for a second time. Dumplings are fully filled till its nicely bloated, yet juicy and tasty. It was then that i found out that Myeongdong Kyoja Main was awarded with Michelin star for both 2017 and 2018.  They have only 5 dishes in all if I’m not wrong. Henceforth, they should be good by focusing on these items only.  The servers can be more polite though...  Clean environment. Try to avoid meal timings (lunch and dinner time) which could expect Long queue. I went at odd hours, so not much of crowds.  Oh ya.. the Main restaurant and branch is just a few steps away...  Overall, very nice noodles and dumplings. Must try!"
40,"There are only 4 items for choose. The dumpling is the best, chopped noodles come second. Portion is quite big. You need pay immediately after making order."
40,"This is a top place for tourists but I felt it was pretty normal. Dumplings didn't have much oomph BUT if you eat it with the garlic chilly sauce provided on the table then it becomes worthwhile as it brings out the flavour of the meat. Noodles were light, could get a little soggy if left in the soup for a bit (unlike the kalguksu I had in Gwangjang Market). Place is very packed all the time, best to avoid peak lunch hours during weekdays."
50,We went here at around 230pm for lunch and we still had to line up a bit to wait for a table to open. That's how busy they are.  It's worth it though. They had big servings for foreigner standards so we ordered to share. It's quite cheap for Korea standard and they're famous for their Mandu. My family loved the taste but I loved the noodle soup more. The soup stock was divine. The triangular dumpling on top was deliciously filled with aromatic meat and the noodles were the right chewiness to it. All in all just perfect. I'd come back here if I return to Seoul.
40,"Very popular; we receive recommendation from hotel reception; it`s interesting to see ; particullary self service; not big variety of meals, but delicious; cheap"
40,"Had a lunch with their signature noodle and was impressed by the soup broth which was tasty. The noodle is smooth and soft but not chewy like the wanton mee i had in HK. The serving is considered too much for foreigners but on the contrary, some locals would even add extra noodles to their bowls. Each bowl comes with spicy kimchi which you could ask for more if you wanted. Their signature noodles costs 8000 wons."
40,"Directly opposite the Solaria hotel, we found this very popular and delicious dumpling noodle place. Has only 5 dishes, free water on table. Pay directly after ordering. For me the kimchi had way too much garlic, but thats why they provide free chewing gum. There is even mouthwash in the toilet."
50,"I try this restaurant when I first arrived in Seoul. Such a nice welcome to Seoul. We ordered all dishes from the menu expect the one which is not available from April. The mandu is delicious, the cold noddles is extremely spicy but it tastes so well (we can’t eat spicy but we finish this dish in just 5 minutes), kimchi here is best kimchi I’ve eaten. The restaurant is very crowded but we don’t need to wait long to eat the food. Definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends."
40,Would recommend to anyone visiting seoul . South korea is great for noodles and this places noodles are awesome
50,This is my favorite noodle soup in town. The soup is chicken based and the texture of noodle is just nice!! The best companion with the noodle is their special kimchi which has very strong garlic taste. The que is mostly long and a bit too busy to expect peaceful dining experience.
50,"Had some time to myself on my last night and was recommended by the hotel's Concierge to visit the famous and popular Myeondong Kyoja restaurant for some late night supper. The restaurant closes at 9.30pm and I arrived just in time for their last order at 9.15pm. Got lost in between the busy streets but finally found myself sitting in front of a hot bowl of Kalguksu (knife-cut noodles with pork dumplings). There were just 4 items on sale – Kalguksu ‘knife-cut noodle’ soup (₩8,000, SGD$9.60), Bibimguksu spicy noodle soup (₩8,000, SGD$9.60), Mandu dumplings (₩10,000, SGD$12), Kongguksu noodles in cold soybean soup (but only available during summer).  No joke, this has got to be one of my favourite dishes during this trip. The noodles were so soft yet springy, the dumplings were just the right ratio of pastry and heart ground meat, and the broth was beautiful and packed with flavour. Sooooo good && finished the whole bowl clean; I demand they open an outlet in Singapore!"
50,"We are looking for a place to have brunch. And this shop caught our attention, and we were genuinely happy with their service here. Friendly staff, food served with lightning speed and tasted amazingly good. And customer keep asking for more kimchi.... wonderful experience here."
30,"If you’re looking for a sit down place to enjoy dinner, I’d look elsewhere. Limited menu of 4 items (the dumplings and soup are pictured). Pay when you order and food comes right out. Experience seemed authentic judging by the number of locals eating but the caliber of the food was nothing to write about. No beverages other than table water."
50,"Went on my own while in Seoul for work. It was a cold rainy Monday at lunchtime and the place was packed, but being a solo diner, I was ushered right in ahead of the linewithout waiting. The only words I can say/understand in Korean are ""thank you"" so I was a bit lost for a minute or two but the serve came over with a menu and explained how it worked, which I thought was super nice as they were slammed and she could have easily been annoyed by my foriegn clumsiness. I had the dumplings, which were sooo good and the kimchee was first hot but delicious as well. Added bonus, a nice older woman sitting next to me showed me which sauces were which and where to get chopsticks (in a drawer at the front of my table!) altogether it was a fun and delicious experience. I would definitely go back."
50,"There are only 4 items on the menu to choose from, so needless to say, they specialize in these items, which are dumplings, noodle, porridge, and a spicy noodle dish. Some items may not be available due to season. When we went, the porridge was not available. As always, great kimchee and side dishes.  Secret, mix the soy sauce with vinegar and add some pepper. Best korean sauce mix for dumplings. Suggest ordering the rice side dish, which is also free refills, to each with the noodle soup."
50,"Fantastic noodle soup, we ordered their signature dish; healthy, cheap, and super tasty! Would highly recommend for a lunch visit to fuel yourself for the shopping street"
50,"This place is awesome. Every time I go to Seoul, it is my first lunch. The place is always packed. I always order the noodle soup and and the dumplings. Each dish cost 8000 KWR. If you visit Seoul, you MUST try it. It's located in Myeondong area."
50,"There is 3 floor for dining here , we were seated at the 2nd floor , went up by elevator, service was fast , we had the signature handmade noodle which was flavorful and delicious, the dumplings was tasty too . 8000 won for the big noodle which could be share by 2 person and dumplings was 10,000 won ."
50,우리는 음식을 좋아합니다. 맛있습니다. 특히 좋아하는 김치. Would like to comeback here its a really nice and good place as well.
40,"Myeondong Kyoja is located of a side street in Seoul’s major shopping street, there in fact 2 outlets not far from each other. It’s an unpretentious place serving just a few items made by hand and very well, they must be doing something right as they have been around for over 40 years. We had their famous Kalguksu noodle soup and the Mandu dumplings which were delicious, the other items are bibim guksu (spicy noodles) and kongguksu noodles (in cold soy bean soup) Highly recommended for an affordable and authentic Korean meal."
40,"Small restaurant . The food is delicious and served hot. The pork dumplings is really good, a must order..."
40,Worth to try. Noodle is very famous and they have nice Kimich too. Add one dumpling it would be better.
50,"THIS PLACE IS LIT.  I had to come back for their noodle soup with dumplings, it is absolutely amazing. The experience itself is fun and worth a trip to this eatery.  I recommend coming for lunch, service is fast and they don't serve alcohol (water only)."
40,"Ordered the soup noodle, dumplings & cold noodle. You'll have to pay as soon as you place your ordered, and the food came very fast. Soup noodle was good, thick broth and smooth noodle. Dumpling was & cold noodle was good too BUT their kimchi was the worst i've ever tasted, i visited many restaurants and their kimchi was good! But NOT this one!"
50,"Nearby our hotel, fast service and good food. I absolutely suggest you this little but delicious place"
30,It was a holiday and was told by concierge that I would wait in line a long time but ended up only being about 5min. You pay as soon as you order. Food comes out fast. Was good but nothing memorable IMO. This is off of eating at best ramen places in Tokyo for a couple days so maybe the comparison was just off
50,"While the menu only has a couple of items the food is simply amazing. A must visit for some superb soup and delectable dumplings, all served in generous portions for a decent price. Will be returning!"
50,"The Kyoza is excellent! Super thin wrap and fresh ingredients, Service is super fast. The restaurant is always pact so best not to go during lunch hours."
50,"This is just the best soup. The broth is ridiculously delicious. Also the dumplings are fantastic. Cheap, fast, reliable. Endorsed."
50,"A work colleague and I were looking for a good place to eat after a few beers. It took us a few minutes to find this place but we were so glad that we did. We were seated immediately and were presented with menus. If you like dumplings and wonton soup you will be very happy because that is what we wanted, and that’s what was on the menu. This is a very limited menu, but it was exactly what we were looking for. The only drawback that I could note was that they did not serve beer. Have a few before you show up and you should be fine. They are very good at what they do here. Visit and you will not be disappointed."
50,arrived here right at lunch time. dumplings were great. the noodle was great too. really like their kimchi though. staffs were nice and friendly.
40,"It was not anything fancy, but the food was good and the price was reasonable! Its a place with a lot of people, and really populare among locals."
40,"This is a great Korean restaurant, good food, top service, foreigner friendly. Try the Korean soups...I highly recommend them"
40,What can I say? Bomb dot com. The dumplings were quite strong. The chop noodles though were out of this world. Very busy and bustling place in the middle of myeongdong. Go during off times and you won't be disappointed. Ps. No drinks available for purchase.
50,"We visited this place 2 years ago. When we came again for lunch, we found that nothing was changed. The foods were still delicious. The kids liked it so much. Two thumbs up for Myeongdong Kyoja."
50,"A tremendous eatery where there are literally four dishes to choose from and have been doing so since 1966 - see attached photograph!  -16c outside in January, I highly recommend trying the homemade sauce in the little silver dish - I won’t spoil it, just try it  This restaurant is in Myeongeong and it was a fantastic experience having the opportunity to be taken down memory lane, reminiscing of the times when Mrs MoylanChung’s own Mother used to bring her here as a child.. Just awesome!"
40,"It was a bit chaotic to find this place in MyeongDong street but we managed. there were really long queues but people ate and moved fast so it was not an issue. The portions here are huge, you should share a bowl of noodles and a set of dumplings. The noodles were well made and cooked, the broth yummy and is sure to warm you up while filling your mouth with all that savoriness. The dumplings were delicious, you'll keep popping them into your mouth! They give free kimchi refills. It was delicious as well but be warned though, the kimchi is heavy on the garlic. Too much may sear your throat and might give you a fever. May be good on cold weather though."
20,Food and services becoming worse and worse Food prices keep on rising and the food tastes change relative to foreigners
50,Yes definitely worth the hype. very easy to order as limited menu but you are just there for dumplings! Steady restaurant in Myeongdong as has earned its reputation. We went on the early side (exactly at 6 pm) so no wait.
50,"Eating kyoja or dumplings in Korea? That would never cross my mind as I would prefer to have my dumplings in some other countries but Myeongdong Kyoja blew my mind away. We were greeted by a long queue but their service were so efficient, it took 10-15 minutes and tada they gave us our table. We ordered 2 bowls of noodles (so yummy in the winter) and 2 trays of kyoja. Let me say, the kyoja is so juicy and authentic. Its really full of flavor in your mouth. I'd definitely come back to MD Kyoja for more the next time."
50,"As its reputation gets bigger, a famous restaurant in Seoul raises prices again and again. But, it's wonderful to have kalguksu(Korean handmade noodle) here with below 10k won. And the taste is the same as it used to be a decades ago.  - Visitors may wonder why this restaurant is so popular with just simple dishes. But, locals can understand the reason. This is old and remaining for ordinary people with a humble recipe.  - It's a bit disappointing staffs are too busy and have almost no time to care for customers. The inside seemed remodeled recently and just like other restaurants.  - Rice is unlimited. But, I couldn't have any. Because kalguksu is quite a lot with mandu(dumplings) in it."
40,"It’s one of the main attraction of Seoul, a place for all ladies, cosmetics, street food are abundance. The restaurant prices are more dearer than other places. It’s a very lively place , it’s interesting to note that everyone selling the same wares. Overall I would prefer to go to other towns which are more local as here almost 90% of ppl here are tourists."
40,"I’ve been a few times now. It’s very nice, but the hype is so, so big about this place.  It is good, but I can’t say it blows my mind.  I think many places in Myeongdong are aimed at tourists. So they have to drive that.  Still, it is nice and not over priced considering it’s location.  I’d continue to go back."
30,"We read that this was one of the famous eatery in Myeongdong and even had 2 branches within the same street. Service was very quick as they only had 4-5 dishes, was served almost immediately after ordering. Portion is quite generous and as usual you have unlimited flow of banchan."
40,this restaurant is one of famous traditional korean dumplings and noodle restaurant. exactly speaking little bit japan+korea style. taste is good and clean. sometimes it’s #1 for tourists
40,"No doubt this place serves delicious Korean steamed dumplings, but the crowd here consists mainly tourists (as with anywhere in Myeongdong).  Clearly this isn’t the place for someone who’d like to immerse in the local Korean culture. My Korean friends don’t even know about the existence of this place.  Menu consists of only a few items - a few different types of noodles and steamed dumplings. Crowded, small place with a snaking queue. Thankfully the queue moved fast even on a weekend night."
30,"The service is ""fast in, fast out"".. you get the idea. The kalguksu was delicious but suspected that they are MSG-laden as we woke up the next day very thirsty after the dinner there."
50,"Came here for lunch. They were busy but they directed up upstairs for a table. We ordered the dumplings for 8,000 won and noodles for 10,000 won. You have to pay immediately. They accept credit card. Food comes fast and the dumplings are REALLY good. Must try!"
50,"When I go to Myeong-dong, I hang out at this restaurant and eat. I always line up, but the skilled staff are good at guiding me. I always eat Calguksu(noodles) and Mandu(dumplings),Even this christmas i ate this :-)"
40,"There are 2 outlets along the same street in Myeongdong and we headed for the main outlet as advised by our local friend. Queue was visibly long as it was around 2pm but we got seated after a 15mins wait (quite decent given the long queue). Menu was simple with just a few options. I'd recommend just going for the noodle soup and steamed dumplings! Their kimchi is also very flavourful and you can ask for unlimited refills of it. Eat it with the noodle soup for a good complement! As for the dumplings, our preference was to dip it in vinegar for that extra zest. Overall, we had a hearty and inexpensive meal here!"
30,"Kalguksu was bleh and tasted MSG-laden, but the bibimyeon / cold noodles was actually great and refreshing. Too bad our meal left us thirsty for hours after. Time to cut down on the salt, Myeongdong Kyoja! Portions were generous but still expensive."
30,Maybe I expected too much? There's usually a long waiting line. Food is good but rather expensive and didn't think it was worth the wait especially at this time of year. So cold!
10,"As a native Korean growing up eating mandoo (dumplings) and kalgooksoo (noodles) on a regular basis, I can confidently say the food here is not representative of the artisan spirit of Korean cuisine. While the soup broth, kimchee and dumplings have that instant grabby taste, the aftermath taste of MSG overwhelmingly kills the original flavor. Either they are trying too hard or taking shortcuts. I am shocked that they received a michelini star, which i think almost acts as a curse to them by instilling false confidence . Also the concept of service doesn’t exist here. They see nothing but tourists’ money. Go wander elsewhere on the corner alleys where merchants huddle - usually they know better!"
50,"The dumplings were delicious with meat filling blended well with cabbages. Both me and my daughter are not meat lovers but like the dumplings at our first bite of it as the meat fillings were tasty. The dumplings were steam just nice, soft and juicy when served."
50,I am happy to say this is a good stuff to try. They have only 4 menus for you. 1 portion enough for 1 people(a lot!) and price are all same 8000 won every dish must try. Ps. The best Kimji here to try for free!!!
50,The knife cut beef broth noodles are flavourful and delicious. The noodles are smooth and the Kyoja steamed to perfection.
40,"Went to try out this eatery as recommended in Trip Advisor. The noodles was slurpy and smooth and tasty. Dumplings were good as well - yummy! Can try it out. Dumplings at 10,000 KW and noodles at 8,000 KW per bowl. Order and pay first."
50,"We spent 11 nights in Seoul and visited this restaurant twice! Had wanted more but it closed early at 9:30pm so there were times when we couldn't get there in time after travelling out of Myeongdong.  Must try the dumplings in separate order, they are not the same as those included in the bowl of noodles....  My youngest boy is a fussy eater but he has finished the huge bowl of noodles and drank all the soup in both visits. Truly delicious!!  The staff is also friendly and efficient. Don't miss this restaurant when you're in Myeongdong!"
10,"4 plates to choose from Make you pay for food first Ordered spicy noodles. Ended up being a cold plate with meat. Both not in description. Needless to say, I had a terrible experience."
50,"Don’t want to raise expectations! But it’s the only place that I ate twice for my korea trip. The noodles are really smooth and slurpy, with tasty soup. Goes well with kimchi. The dumplings has a very thin skin, filled with meat and vegetable fillings, with a sauce that goes well with it. So overall, a nice cheap eatery place for a satisfactory meal."
30,"The broth of the kalguksu was flavourful and the noodles soft. On the first few mouthfuls, I liked the taste... but after a while it got kind of boring. Perhaps would have been better for them to offer smaller bowls and more variety?  My husband found the broth oily though. So it’s a thumbs down from him."
40,"The Kalguksu noodles dish is delicious, the place is very popular, well organized service, good price. Perfect for lunch !"
50,"Nice dumpling and noodles for a cold weather in Seoul. The dumpling meat is fresh and skin is thin. If u are small eater, the noodle can be shared by 2 pax."
40,"My wife & I met a couple of friends at this place. It was very busy but food came out fast. The only thing we didn't like was we were waiting for one more person to come & the server was very impatient. Otherwise, the most of things were excellent."
50,"They had the most delicious dumplings that I’ve had in a long time. This restaurant is great to just stop in and get a quick, hot meal. Definitely stop in and get the dumplings. The noodles were amazing too."
40,"I nearly turned away - I was away from my group and on my own and the place was packed. It was a little intimidating, but I am glad I stuck to my guns and went inside.  The soup was amazing. To those who complain the soup was bland - at first taste, I agreed with you. And then I looked around and saw what everyone was doing. People took the very spicy kimchi that was served with the soup, dipped it in and then ate cabbage and noodles together. Wait staff coming around helpfully refilled the kimchi every time I ran out. My only warning, don't add too much, because by the end the broth becomes some spicy it's difficult to eat. I would definitely come back!!"
20,"Really bland food, ok kimchi, terrible service and also not cheap. Would not indicate it to anyone. The only taste that you get it's the black pepper and salt that you put yourself on the thin stew"
10,"The flavor of gyoza is disappointing. The broth of noodle is tasteless. But those are the only very limited menu options. I don't know how it is so popular, but I'm not coming back again."
50,"Its full of flavor, meaty noodle soup. Might encounter lionh que at the entrance but que gets short very soon. You get garlic kimchi as side dish, its strong but goes very well with the soup. You order on the table and need to pay on ordering food. Food are served very quick as well. Steamed dumplings are juicy, meaty ones, recommended! You can order a bowl(tiny) of rice for free which you can have with noodle soup. Its especially great for winter food, makes me drooling while writing this!"
40,"The noodle is quite big for just one person. We should have ordered 1 and share it (so we can try other menus :P). The dumpling was also very nice, meat tasted more than the skin/flour part :) very sweet and savory. The restaurant is not hard to find, just follow google maps or other maps. It is located in the heart of myeongdong shopping area."
40,"The place is many decades old and still popular among both local and international foodies. The noodle soup and dumplings pairs so well and their freshly made gimchi is also very impressive. Only one downside, gimchi is great but beware it's all garlic that makes it so good."
50,"Everyone here order the dumplings and noodle soup. There’s only 4 items on the menu. Dumplings 10 pcs and 3 types of noodles. But you’ve got to try it if you’re in the area. It’s one of the best dumplings you’ll ever try, If not the best."
40,delicious noodle and dumpling. good to eat when the weather is cold. there are so many tourist
50,The noodles are so smooth! The dumpling skins are so thin and with so much fillings in it. Will revisit next time. Convenient place.
50,The food was tasty. The service was prompt. We would come again. If u need Chinese food this is one of the best choice
50,"I come here every time I visit Seoul and the quality of the kalguksu and the kimchi remains as high today as it was 20+ years ago. The broth is delicious, the noodles silky soft and the little dumplings included in every bowl are just the perfect size. Theirs is some of the spiciest and most garlicky kimchi you will eat, and the little mint they give you will do nothing to disarm your breath afterward, but oh, is it worth every stinking bite!  You should get here before noon in order to avoid the long queues that form soon after. Pay for your order when you place it and your meal will appear within minutes. No lingering once you're done... you need to free your table for the next guest! Besides, there's plenty of shopping to do in Myeongdong!"
10,"Compared to fame, it is very humble. It's a famous place, so the employees are arrogant. The quality and quantity of food is lower than ever before."
50,"In the heart of the old downtown in Seoul, one must try Myeongdong Kyoja restaurant. This restaurant pioneered opening a kalguksu restaurant in Myeondong area and prospered. The taste seems to never change and as the PH3 mission statement of this restaurant, owners and staff believe in perfect heart, honesty, harmony and humanity. Noodles, rice and kimchi will be refilled free of charge. I feel like eating at home. Downside of this place is that it is so popular that one should expect to wait in line and no reservations will be accepted. Myeongdong Kyoja is located on a very narrow side street. Please look for the drug store as in the photo, go into the narrow street which is full of small stores, pass H&M store and the restaurant is right next to it."
50,"This famous place boasts the best noodles and dumplings in Seoul. Always a line that moves fast. Sit down order, slurp and go! Nothing fancy and very inexpensive and fast. It is a must! Their Kim Chi is wonderful as well. The dumpling portions are huge. Really meant for 2 or more. They have pictures so any language is accepted!"
50,"This Korean restaurant has been recommended to me by a Chinese friend who lived for 8 years in Seoul. Just a great place to eat simple, but tasty Korean Noodle Soup and dumplings! The place quite popular and it can happen that you have to wait for a while to get a seat. Being alone helped me, as there are many people from near by offices coming and have a quick lunch."
40,"Quite a fan of dumplings of all kind sand from all countries so was eager to give these a try. Not in a position to judge them versus other dumpling places in Seoul so this may be a comment on the dumpling type rather than the restaurant but I thought they were nice rather than anything special. Certainly not a patch on xiaolongbao, gyoza, chinese fried dumplings, or khinkali. As a result not worth a special trip here unless you've got lots of time in Seoul. Cold noodles were nice and spicy but not something you feel like eating loads of. Place is efficient and basic. We were in and out in 30mins at the most."
50,I tried Noodle Soup during lunch. Luckily I got to the restaurant early so I don’t have to queue up long. It’s so yummy and delicious. Definitely will go there again if I visit Seoul.
40,One of the best dumplings you can taste in korea. I went there right at the opening time and the place was full in 10 min. Dumplings are very juicy and delicious. I highly recommend.
50,We visited this restaurant for dinner on a Friday during the Chuseok holidays. In front of us were at least 50 parties in the queue. We had our table after waiting for around 20 mins. Quite ok. Basically there are only 4 items in the menu. Quite easy to choose. Service was prompt although very crowded. Good. Food quality was excellent. Generous serving. Worth a try when visiting Myeongdong.
30,"In all travel books, this place is introduced as one of best place for dumplings and cold noodles. It used to be the best long time ago, but not any more. There are many more better places for dumplings and cold noodles. Not worth a visit spending extra money. (Food is not bad though.)"
50,My parents were regulars since they were in their 20's and I always have lunch there when i'm in the neighborhood! You can ask for rice (after you're done with the noodles) and have it with the leftover soup :)
50,The mandu is a must order. The Kimchi is simply fantastic if you are a garlic lover. You have been warned: there are tonnes of garlic in their kimchi.
40,Tried the famous kalguksu. Noodles were very soft and soup was pretty tasty...i placed the kimchi in the soup for added flavour. However service was almost non existent due to the high turnaround. Went in at about 8.45pm and they were starting to pack up right next to me. I felt pressured to finish asap. It was nice but will prob try the spicy bibim noodles instead.
50,"Honestly at first, I was a bit disappointed because of the limited menu (only 4 dishes in the menu). When I tasted the dumplings, however, the limited menu doesn't matter anymore. They were so delicious, juicy and light. You could continue to eat them. I tasted so many different dumplings before but these are the best dumplings I've ever had.  The soup noodle was also very tasty. The noodle was just right hardness and the soup was yummy, too. The price was very reasonable. The service was not excellent but I would definitely go back. Because of the great dumplings!"
50,"Dumplings at Myeongdong Kyoja is very different in taste from the other dumplings you see along the same street. Wrapped up like a 小籠包 instead of the usual crescent moon style seen everywhere, the taste is much more complex than the usual ones. (First, you will smell the sesame oil, One first bite, you will taste the meat juices. Next comes the spices used to flavour the meat and finally, the fragrance from the little bits of Shitake & spring onions inside that completes the flavour.) Each dumpling pairs perfectly with the housemade kimchi. Their Kalguksu (刀切面) ‘chopped noodle’ soup had 4 wantons or 雲吞 like dumplings served on top of the chopped noodles. Always pair each spoonful of noodles with soup along with a piece of their kimchi. Your will feel the flavours bursting inside your mouth. Their dumplings also pairs amazingly with the kimchi. It activates your tastes buds into overdrive."
40,The menu is limited but that just helps you make your food choices easier. The dumplings are juicy and the soup noodles were pretty tasty. There is always a huge crowd but the line moves pretty fast. Be prepare to pay right after you order. You will also receive mint before the food is serve. The mint will certainly help to lessen the garlicky breathe from the kimchi.
50,"A mandatory stop to enjoy their delicious dumplings. There are 2 outlets in Myeongdong and recommended to avoid peak hour to avoid long queue.  Normally they will give your mint candy upon payment. If they are too busy, please feel free to ask them because you need it to get rid of bad breath."
50,"There was a bit of a queue when we were here for lunch, but the line moves really fast so it's fine to join the queue cos you will get a table soon. We had the soup noodles, spicy noodles and dumplings and they were all good!!! Portions are huge so come with an empty tummy."
40,"Love it that they make it easy with only 4 items on the menu and the line moves fast. We went around 8 pm, no line. Be ready to pay before food is served. Filled with locals and tourists, a must stop over when in Seoul."
40,"We got here at 1130 for lunch and thankfully we were early because the queues formed shortly after. I have not seen a restaurant this popular in Seoul, with lines that snake from the first to second level staircase. Dumplings were yummy and so was the noodles, though I'm giving it a four stars because i tried several other dumpling places in Seoul and found those to be pretty good too!"
30,"We also order a spicy noodle (8,000w?) and a dumpling. Both was great despite the spicy noodle was a bit too spicy yet very delicious.  When you order, you need to instantly pay to the waitress and she will gave you a ticket. Later, another waitress will check your ticket before serving.  The food served very quick, the restaurant a bit crowded, the toilet was clean."
50,"I'm frustrated to see so many recent reviews saying they didn't enjoy the food here. The food is absolutely delicious. As someone who has lived in Korea for a year I can tell you that the noodle soup here is outstanding and the noodles are actually meant to be soft because that is the style. It is not a ramen, it is not a wonton soup, it is Kalguksu. The noodles are hand cut and soft. Mandu (Korean style dumplings) are usually made with more vegetables than other dumplings in East Asia. Mandu are often filled with glass noodles, tofu, kimchi, green onion and chives but the mandu at Myeongdong Kyoja are very meaty and garlicky. The eatery is very busy, yes. It is not the kind of place to go to and have a 4 hour long dinner with wine and conversation. But if you are a foodie and you love delicious food that is so full of garlic that they give you a mint at the start of the meal, then you can not miss this place. You will never have kalguksu or mandu like this outside of Korea."
30,"This restaurant has a lot of branches even in the same town because they are well known over the years for their dumplings and noodles. I was there 10 years ago and recently. The place is busier and felt more like a converter belt. The main goal of this place is to have you eat quickly and send you out immediately. They will seat you with other customers to speed up the wait line. You order and pay right away (within 5 mins). The food comes in even faster and once you are finished with your meal, you are expected to vacant that seat ASAP. Therefore, if you are in a rush then this is the place for you. If you want to enjoy your friends and the food, go somewhere else. The food is average and not what it used to be."
40,Food was very good. Only 3/4 dishes on the menu but everything is excellent. Special atmosphere like a school canteen but worth to try it at least once.
30,"Dumplings are made in many countries with different variations, but this type is like those in Hong Kong. It's a Michellin restaurant and the taste is ok, not outstanding in my opinion. You can easily find better dumplings in Japan, Guangdong and Hong Kong. The noodles are too soft to my liking. Not recommended."
50,"This place is a must! The handmade noodle soup was so yummy, steamed mandus were big and juicy. Service was extremely fast."
40,Very popular restaurant in Myeong dong. There's always a line but it goes pretty fast. Love their huge meaty dumplings and their soybean noodles. Worth a visit and it's very unreasonably priced!
50,"We went here after a recommendation from he guest house owner, there was a short wait for 5-8 minuets - after which you sit around shared tables. A lot of locals ran in, ate, and ran out - this isn't a place to sit and enjoy a meal, it's a place to get some amazing food and still have time to shop! The dumplings were amazing - as was their kimchee which is served free. It's slightly pricey - but so is most of Seoul I've noticed :)"
40,"Our family of 2 adults, 1 teen and a 9 year old came here for a late dinner. We ordered 2 kalguksu soup noodles, 1 order of steamed dumplings and 1 spicy noodle. It was a ton of food that we couldn't really finish. My 9 year old thought he could finish 2 orders of dumplings, but he couldn't even finish the whole order. The dumplings have a lot of nice, meaty filling and are generously sized (unlike the Din Tai Fung which are a 1-2 bite experience). The dumplings were tasty. The soup noodles were also a very generous portion with a tasty soup. But the noodles were a bit softer than I would think, I prefer my noodles with more of a bite, a bit chewier. They do a brisk business here. It was super crowded, but they get you in and out quickly. I would recommend stopping in for a quick meal if you like noodles & dumplings."
40,"Midst in the busy Myeongdong, you can eat these celicious noodles. Serving is very quick and friendly. Certainly recommended!"
50,"Quick Easy fresh convent simple food...loved it and friendly service. Simple menu, 4 items to choose from. Eat and run! All fresh.. totally made crime scratch in the kitchen. I loved it and they had good aircondtioners too :-)"
30,"The restaurant located at the heart of Myeongdong. There are a lot of visitors to this restaurant. They only serves few dishes of food and there are not much choice of food.  The positive thing is that when you make order, the noodles and dumplings can come to your table within 1 minute. We do not need to waste time in waiting for food. We can spare more time for shopping in Myeongdong.  The taste of noodles and dumplings are just fair."
40,"There's always a line here but the turnover is very quick. The kyoja dumplings and noodles are classic and very good, and the kimchi is uber garlicky. A must visit for lunch whenever in Myeongdong."
50,"The shop is very easy to locate. Directly opposite of Solaria Nishitetsu Hotel. We actually went there on our 1st day arrival in Myeongdong & the last day went we depart for home. Both times I also couldn't finish my bowl of hot succulent noodle as the portion was quite big. They only sell 4 items in the menu but the crowd is always there. Prices are reasonable. Our bowl of noodles - 8000 won each & dumplings - 10000 won.  Busy restaurant but food comes really fast & hot. After ordering, the waitress will collect money from you immediately. I must say the kimchi they served are a bit too spicy to our liking. Otherwise, everything will be perfect!"
30,"Food is good They have very few dishes in the menu but everything is very good It's a nice, cheap restaurant in a very busy area"
50,"Very well located in the middle of Myongdong and the food is amazing ! Dumplings were delicious as well the noodles. You can share the dish, its very big boll of noodles."
40,"It's a noodle restaurant located in Myeongdong that is specialized in handmade noodle soup and Mandu. Thin elastic dumpling skin with juicy meat filling and elastic noodle with comforting broth, both dishes are must try !"
40,"This is one of my parents' favorite restaurants in Seoul. They went to school in Seoul in 1970s and I was told they have been visiting Myungdong Kyoja since then. Every time we visit there we could see lots of tourists mostly from Japan and China but even for local Korean people this restaurant is super popular.  The most popular dish is Kalguksu, which is basically a noodle soup. Compared to other Kalguksu places in Korea, Myeongdong Kyoto's one is very rich. They also give very spicy and garlicky Kimchi as free side dish. Dumplings are good too but most people go there for their Kalguksu. If you are still hungry after the bowl of noodle, they give extra noodle or small bowl of rice as complimentary when asked."
40,"Tried these dumplings, they were delicious. The accompanying sauce is yummy too. Love the Kim chi as well. Went to the restaurant twice."
40,"The signature dish of noodles with dumplings in soup did not disapoint. The soup was really tasty. Noodles were al dente and done just right. The dumplings had generous fillings. The steamed dumplings were alright as I have eaten better ones at Din Tai Fung. The food came within minutes. All in all, an excellent meal that left me fully satisfied."
50,My friend introduced this to me. Never regret eating the dumpling noodles! It was simply delicious and they were really efficient in serving the food! Highly recommended place to eat in Myeongdong!
50,"This is a very popular place to eat in Myeongdong. Their dumplings are really good. Their hand cut noodles are delicious. It's a no frill place, you sit down, you order and in less than a minute you get your food. Can go wrong if you need a quick lunch."
50,Very interesting place. The most interesting and impressive is how fast the food comes to your table. Unbelievable you will see. 4 dishes to eat but very nice. We were in private place with another couple and very nice. I recommend that place to eat for sure. Thanks
50,"This is a famous store in Myeongdong, not only for the tourist but lots of locals come here for meals. Was in the restaurant on a weekday around 1:15, waited for 20 minutes for a table.  I ordered a soya milk noodle and my friend ordered a jajinmein and we shared the dumplings! The dumplings are huge and nice but if you are not a heavy eater you might not be able to finish it even with your friend!"
50,"I usually visit this restaurant at least twice during my stay, but I think I'll never have enough of their food! The Kalguksu (noodle in soup) and Kyoja (steamed dumplings) are excellent, but most of all, I would like to point out that they serve the best kimchi I've ever had, and its all you can eat! Quite hot so you may not like it for those who are not fond of spicy food, but for spicy lovers, definitely try it out."
40,I thought the noodles and dumplings here were pretty good. Worth going at least once. Dumplings could've been more flavourful
50,"The menu is simple - dumplings or noodles. We had the dumplings, we split an order and were satisfied but not stuffed. That said I could have eaten a whole order and then some, they were a tasty delight."
40,Their famous noodle soup was abit salty for my like. The handmade noodle itself is superb. Best if youre with a company or two as their potions are big especially the mandoos.
40,"You don't have many food options because there are 3 main dishes that are available, soya noodle in soup, cold soba, and dumpling. In a way, it is like fast food restaurant. All taste very good."
40,"The menu offers limited choice. The dumplings and noodles aren't outstanding but they are sharing with us a sense of local atmosphere that's unbeatable. I will keep going there in spite of the long queue, haha. By the way, the free kimchi was so crunchy and appealing!"
50,"Heard this place is famous for their chopped noodle and dumplings and it did not disappoint me. The noodle comes with a delicious broth, vegetables, ground beef and triangle dumplings, overall a bowl full of DELICIOUSNESS! We also got the steam dumplings on the side, I thought those were good as well though it wasn't outstanding, just regular pork and chives dumplings. Everything is pretty straightforward, you just order anything out of the 4 items they have on the menu, pay first and the food come out within a minute! I'm still regret the fact that i didn't get to try the cold soybean noodle that they have because i was full after finishing the chopped noodle. A bowl costs about 8,000 won which isnt bad at all. Give this place a try if you happen to be in Myeodong area !"
50,"Easily found in Myeongdong. Only four items in the menus, english and chinese menus is available. Dumplings and noodles were really good!"
40,I loved the noodles with dumplings and also the steamed dumplings which were more refined than a number of other restaurants that I visited. Also the 3 types of kimchi which accompanied the meal were very good.  I tried the cold noodles in soymilk. It was pleasant but not quite my cup of tea. Probably because I like my noodles hot.  There was a long queue at one outlet and a shop employee led us to another which was just down the road and which had a much shorter queue. Service was fast and efficient. I look forward to patronizing this restaurant again when I visit Myeondong.
50,"This is a great restaurant in Myeongdong and is quite affordable. There are only 4 items on the menu and we tried 3 of them. We had the Kalguksu soup, Bibimguksu spicy noodle and the Mandu dumplings. It was all good. My kids loved the Kalguksu and the dumplings were some of the best I've had!"
40,"We went there during lunch time and service was rather efficient. We waited less than 5 minutes to get our table. It was packed with working Korean adults. There is only a few items in the menu and most tables ordered the noodle soup and Kyoja. Waiters aren't the most friendly person but then again, this place isn't a cafe that you want to hang out for long."
50,"Bumped into some M'sians while in Seoul. We exchanged suggestions on places to go, eateries etc. They recommended the Myeongdong Kyoja as a ""must go.""  So we went and it was quite easy to find this restaurant. There's not much to choose from on the menu - only 4 items – Kalguksu ‘chopped noodle’ soup (₩8,000, SGD$9.60), Bibimguksu spicy noodle soup (₩8,000, SGD$9.60), Mandu dumplings (₩10,000, SGD$12), Kongguksu noodles in cold soybean soup.  We had the spicy noodle, Manu dumplings and the chopped noodles.  When the food was served, we realised that it was too much - 2 persons could probably share one bowl instead.  Mandy dumplings is a must have. Avoid the spicy noodle if you're not the ""spicy"" type.  Certainly recommended- especially Singaporeans and Msians who like this kind of food."
40,"We went there for lunch and really liked the concept. There was a stort line of people waiting when we arrived, but everyone only waited for a few minutes to be seated. There where only a few dishes to chose between and you had to pay when ordering, but then the food was served really fast and it was absolutely wonderful. You don't get too much service or attention, but that's all part of the concept and I guess the reason for being able to serve great food at reasonable prices. And we wanted a quick lunch, so it suited us just perfect!"
40,"This noodle and dumpling shop is a classic! The restaurant is managed much like a fast-food restaurant, with communal, closely packed tables and a limited menu. Don't go there for an elegant night out, but do go there for some of the best noodles and dumplings you will have anywhere and an authentic experience surrounded by locals. In spite of the assembly-line approach to seating and food service, I never felt rushed and got a lot of friendly, quick attention from the lovely hard-working staff. Worth a visit for both the great food and the remarkable experience."
50,"This is the second time I visited this shop. I actually prefer the soup noodle much than the dumpling. I find the dumpling overrated, it's really nothing to shout about"
40,"Restaurant is a bit crowded but the speed in ordering and finished is fast, food quality is okay and offered in reasonable price. Staff in such busy environment still provide good services."
40,"I visited on a weekday night around 8.30pm and managed to get seats quite quickly. The soup noodles are tasty. Spicy dry noodles not bad. Dumplings are packed with meat which are very filling. I think i over ordered and ended up in negative utility. Hence, best to order for sharing."
30,"The pork dumplings are meaty and the hot soup noodles are indeed smooth as commented by most reviewers. However, for us living and well travelled in South east Asia, we found it average and really, nothing to rave about. Fuller and tastier steam dumplings and noodles are found in almost every Cantonese/Chinese restaurants in Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan. Not sure what's the fuss about this supposedly famous restaurant."
50,"The menu has only 4 items and the Kyoja is a must order! Thin dumpling skin wrapped around generous serving of minced pork and chives. The hot noodles are yummy too. They also serve 2 types of cold buckwheat noodles, but the soy bean one is abit of an acquired taste.  There's lift access here so will be convenient for elderly or young children as the seating area is on Level 2 or 3.  Directions: Myeongdong Station Exit 8, turn left into the 1st alley and walk straight ahead till you see the brown signage on the right. It's just shortly after Starbucks."
40,"We dined here twice, because my daughter fell in love with the dumplings. This place has a lot of hype and long lines at times… but probably worth trying at least once. I tried the noodle soup, spicy noodles and the dumplings, and al were good. I usually do not care for dumplings that have gristle within the meaty interior… and these had them… but the delicate wrapper and good flavor compensated for that."
30,It serves great korean style dumplings but not worth to wait that long... You can have the same food in Insadong too.(anywhere in Korea)
40,Visited this restaurant on 17th June 2017 based on TripAdvisor.. good recommendations and excellent food!!
40,I will visit this dumpling and noodles shop when I travel in Seoul. This time I visited twice! Noodles are yummy. Do avoid the crowd in lunchtime as the locals will also dine here.
50,"Trunks place sells only 4 items. Hand cut noodles, steamed dumplings, spicy cold noodles and cold noodles in soy bean milk. Stick with the safe options by ordering only the hand cut noodles and steamed dumplings."
40,Always torn in between the kalguksu or the bimbimyeon as they are allso yummy. The mandu too are not to be missed. A must try if you are in myeongdong.  Staff are not the friendliest but very efficient.  Both outlets are just a few steps away. Easy to locate!
50,"Have previously tried their kalguksu, bibimguksu and mandu. It was just ok for me. Restaurant is also famous for their cabbage kimchi too, but it is super garlicky.  This time around I really wanted to try their Kongguksu (cold Soy milk noodles).....which is only served during the summer months.  The big bowl of noodles is served with thick fragrant soy milk, julienned cucumber and sesame seeds. It's cold, fragrant and very filling.  It's worth a try if you have not tried Kongguksu before, especially during the hot months of summer."
30,"I like Korean restaurants because each one only offered its specialties on the menu. Steamed dumplings, hot noodles & cold noodles are offered. We tried them all. I think the quality is above average given most restaurants have high standards here. Their kimchi have too much garlic favors for me though."
50,"... authentic, simple, good, honest and fast! seems to be famous because of the many local guests!....well organized!"
50,"The routine: - queue to get in (if applicable) - Order one of the four options; I chose the most popular hot noodle (in pic) - pay (yes, pay after you order) and the waitress will drop a mint on the table - food arrived (with kimchi on the side); eat - waitresses will walk around to refill your kimchi; eat - stand up, leave  Tasty noodle, which has a unique texture to it."
30,"Delicious dumplings with thin skin, noodles are delicious too. Go early to avoid long q. Waitress can speak basic English. Worth trying."
40,"It was the right choice to include this in our itinerary. We loved the signature noodles soup and the dumplings. The portion is really huge for two, so if you are a small eater, suggest to order just the noodle and come back another day for the dumplings. The 10 dumplings were full or meat so it is really filling! We came back on our last day to have the noodles again. Note there are only 3-4 items on the menu which they served. Not much variety but you just need to order their signature dishes and won't regret.  There were 2 outlets we saw in myeongdong. We visited the one nearer to our hotel or exit 8 of myeongdong station. Long queue on Sunday morning but if you visit on weekdays morning or before 12 noon should be fine."
20,"Well... as a local I am very curious about the true recipe of Kyoja (a kind of Chinese dumpling) at this place. You should not think the dishes here as a traditional Korean dish. The flavor comes very sweet and soup is dumped by Korean style small shredded beef. Noodle quality also is average. I heard that this place used to be famous for Japanese travelers. However, I found none from my recent visit there."
40,"This place served traditional Korean soup and dumplings. My husband and I shared the kalguksu and dumplings. The menu consists of 4 things. Kalguksu (a traditional simple Korean soup), bibimguksu (a spicy soup), kongguksu (a soup made with bean water and chlorella) and dumplings. We got the traditional soup and dumplings and shared. The dumplings were very good. I personally love dumplings and these did not disappoint. The soup was pretty good. My husband really enjoyed it and Id give it 3.5 or 4 out of 5 stars. It was a little bland but they had some spices on the table you could use to add some flavor to it. Overall a good place to grab lunch! Id recommend it!"
50,"I am not a great fan of dumplings but this place really changed my mind.  It was a bit difficult locating this shop at Myeongdong as you know the place is filled with shops after shops. Another problem is that there is no shop number displayed. Anyway, we finally managed to locate the restaurant after some searching. Next time it is best to take a picture on the website.  The restaurant is currently undergoing some renovations and the place is covered up which makes it even more difficult to locate them. However, if you are hardworking enough, you should be able to eventually find it.  As with other reviews, the menu is very limited but that is enough for a Kyoja restaurant as it is what you are here for : the Kyoja !  The dumplings were really, really delicious and packed full with meat. The dumpling skin is fine and thin and one bite into it oozes out lots of meat.  The noodle soup was also flavourful and it's quite a big bowl for one to finish. It can be shared with another person together with an order of dumplings.  Another unforgettable dish in this restaurant is the kimchi. This is the most yummy kimchi that I have eaten so far in Seoul. However, be prepared, the garlic taste is super strong. So no good for first dates ! No wonder they offer you a mint sweet at the end of your meal though I do not htink it will remove the taste in your mouth.  The prices were reasonable due to the quality of the food.  High recommended next time if you are in Myeongdong and craving for dumplings - must go place. We went during dinner time & managed to get a table really fast. Most people would just finish their meal and move on to make way for other customers."
40,"hiding in plane site, because its facade is under renovation... we have to walk around to find it awhile.  food is great with only 4 menus available to enjoy the traditional local style noodle, xiao ling pao and kimchi.  The service is very interesting as we have to pay upfront right after you order. however for kimchi you can refill as much as you like"
50,"We have lunch in the Myeongdong Kyoja Main restaurant. On week days now problem to go for, but REMEBER on Friday, sunday and saturdays FUEL ! You need time to get a table there. So think about, when to go. there. The noodles and the dumpling are excellent. Very fast and cheap for korean and tourist people. Thank you"
40,"There are only about 3-4 items on the menu. You had to pay before you ate so that people can come and go quicker. We had the mandu and that was 10,000 won. it was good but i found it to be average."
50,Great location in Myeong-dong. The noodles is 😋 soup base 5 star. Meat so fresh and good service. Must eat!
50,"Yeah, there's really not much I can say other than, THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!! Hands down the best dumplings we have ever consumed. They provided an English menu but pretty much told us what to eat and I was so grateful they did as it was scrumptious!! Only downside, you may be expected to queue... as a tourist, avoid this place during peak lunch hours and you should be fine!! A must see in Korea!!"
50,"Was a bit of a culture shock when the lady taking our order told us bluntly we had to pay up first, right at our table, after confirming our order.  The food was very tasty though. On our first visit, we ordered a bowl of noodle with dumplings each and it was too much. On our second visit, we ordered a bowl of noodle and a plate of dumplings to share and it was perfect.  Like the fact that the food is neither salty nor greasy. Wonderful meal."
50,"This is quite the famous and popular place. Mostly packed, mostly Koreans, surprisingly few tourists...at least on the night we went. Which was quite a good thing.  The place offers only a few items: handmade kalguksu (noodle soup), mandu (dumplings), bibim guksu (spicy noodles), and kongguksu (noodles in cold soybean soup).  We had two of them, the kalguksu and the dumplings. Both were served really fast - despite the fact that every seat was taken. Both meals served were cooked to perfection. The broth of the noodle soup was rich and full of flavours. Handmade noodles with a good bite and nice dumplings. There's Kimchi on the side....add it to your soup if you like more spice.  The steamed dumplings were as good as they get as well. A lot of meat filling with nice herbs and spices. Great stuff. Can't rate the other items on the menu....but the two we had were amazing. So I guess the others wouldn't be a let-down as well. They know what they do here. It's simple: Small menu - but what they do is perfect! Just no beer is available here...or Soju...or even tea. So we were stuck with water. Would've been nice to have some cold ""Cass"" on the side.  Besides that it's perfect. A meal for two for just under 20$. And portions are generous. Highly recommended!  Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
20,Had calguksu (noodles with soup) and dumpling. Soup noodle was OK but dumpling was not tasty at all. I don't understand why this place is top of the list of restaurants in Seoul.
50,"Restaurant was easy to find using google map. The hot wanton soup with noodles was delicious. The dumplings were good too, with thin wrappers and meat fillings. For those who love spicy kimchi, this place serve hot and spicy kimchi... that i had a second serving of it!"
50,"Don't expect a fancy restaurant or warm and friendly service. However, this is a local joint loved by the locals for the homemade food. The dumplings were outstanding. The kimichi perfectly spicy."
50,I went there twice this trip n it's never enough .. the kyoja is Super delicious shame that I only have limited space in my stomachs 😬 And the kimchi is the best I had so far !! Spicy & I love it!
10,"We went at around 11am for our brunch and we have a family of seven. We ordered 3 plate of dumplings (each plate with ten dumplings), 2 bowls of cold noodles and 1 bowl of hot noodle to share as you know it's all carbs, we don really eat so much carbs. The waitress which I assumed to be the store manager retorted with her mediocre standard of English "" are u sure that's enough, the serving for the noodle is very little"" and I was like .. ""ya, why not?"" So she walked off to input the order into the system and when she returned she exclaimed further ""We will not take in anymore orders from your table if you ask for more later as the crowd will start coming in later."" I don see what's the fuss about adding on more orders and I don even find the dumplings are nice. The dumplings are just like those packaged food which you can find in the supermarket, heat it up and it's exactly the same. It's not as the meat is so fresh that there's a wow factor. The skill of preparing the skin of the dumpling is so bad that it torn apart the moment I lay my chopsticks on it. I think this store is just overrated by the tourists that makes it so popular when you can just spend your calories, money and time on other Korean food which taste even much better than dumplings which in the first place dumplings are Chinese food. If you really Wan to eat nice dumplings , ding tai fung might taste even better in Seoul ( one store in myeongdong hotel 28) Speaking about the noodles, again there's nothing special about the noodle when the waitress told us it's popular in the store, it's just average noodle soup which you can find in other stores. On a fair side, I would need to say the only thing nice in this restaurant is the kimchi. They are marinated with fresh garlic which will leave you burning your mouth. Here comes the management of the restaurant , it's so disoriented, as we were having or meals halfway through, one ajuma came over our table and asked if we have paid our bill. Shouldn't you be recording and taking note instead of asking me? I can just say yes I have paid and what are you going to do? And her bill is just calculating the bowls on the tables, where is the control of completeness? I'm astonished for how a big restaurant like that was being handled. Overall, I would say, it's cheap food not quality food. Don even bother wasting your time if you are looking for nice food ( I won't even say quality food just ""nice"") No photos taken for this meal as it's just wasting my time."
50,"Myeongdong Kyoja is definitely a pleasant surprise to me as I was originally in doubt of having Kyoja in Korea when I should be exploring the ""typical"" Korean cuisines. There are only five dishes served in the restaurant. I tried the hot noodles and dumplings. It was amazing such simple and affordable food could be so tasty. The noodles were soft (it may be a bit too soft for people who prefer hard noodle texture) and the soup base was good. Dumplings were also of good quality.  The restaurant is always busy, but the turnaround is very fast, as they deliver food within 3-5 mins.  Planning to go back again to try the cold noodle during my one week stay in Seoul! Recommend to people who want to have some simple and affordable good food."
40,"I was travelling solo so cannot order much and decided to try their noodle for dinner. Arrived at around 8:30pm on a Monday evening and was quickly shown a desk/table. After reviewing the menu (only 4 items) I decided on the cold noodle instead of the traditional Kalguksu칼국수 because it was only available between April to October. My noodle arrive fast and I was so surprise - it was covered in thick white soup/sauce. I took a spoonful of the soup and it was very tasty. Very thick soya bean puree soup (not the water down soya bean milk type), this you can taste the bean cure too. Very nice. So I would recommend this dish too beside their traditional Kalguksu."
40,Dumpling and noodles are quite good and here is nice located to visit foreigners. I recommend here to feel Korean food.
50,Me and my colleagues were there for lunch! Our Korean business partner took us there for a quick lunch before the next meeting. Food arrives very quickly and very delicious noodles but I love the homemade dumplings!! The pork filling was very well made!! Can't wait to go back for more!!
40,"Ordered the noodle .. was just ok. But the Mandu is really good. Generous tasty fillings and thin skin makes it perfect. A very much fast serve style restaurant, ordered and paid straight away on the table. Ps: very minimum english so use menu's picture to order ."
50,The place is always crowded but it is reasonably priced and quality of food is good. They have 2 branches in Myeongdong itself but queues are long at both branches.
40,The service was speedy and it's a perfect place for a quick lunch stop This place is also great if you want a break from the heavy meat diet. The soup was full of flavour and the noodles were wonderfully tasty and silky. The dumplings and the garlicky kimchi was also great sides. Definitely would go back.
50,"The first time I came here was because of the good review that I heard. then I come again the second time because it really is THAT GOOD! the dumpling is moist, juicy and it's just RIGHT! also, the kalguksu is still the same as i can remember. really yummy..=D"
40,"Based on a recommendation we date at Myeongdong Kyoja. We went at 1100 and missed the crowds. They only have four dishes to choose from. We had the dumplings and the non spicy noodles. The dumplings were the standout dish - very large, juicy and tasty. The noodles had a nice bite. Not too expensive either. Worth visiting."
40,"If you have been eating too much BBQ, this will be a good comfort food that is not to hard for the stomach and especially perfect during a cold day. The noodle was soft and the dumplings were adequately seasoned and tasty. Slightly oily though. However it is not a place for gathering. Basically just a place to eat and go. Only a handful of dishes in the menu to choose from and don't serve alcohol."
20,"I was attracted by the overwhelming positive online review. However, I found it is quite expensive while the quality of dumpling and noodles were average."
50,"We love dumpling (""mahndoo"" in Korean) and cold noodle with soybean soup (100%). The rifill for the noodle is free. It is awesome to taste the quality food with a very reasonable price and free refill for noodle.  Don't miss it. These two things are only available in Korea."
50,"The dumplings were so good even my 5yr old toddler ate several of them which was very odd but we all loved it! Recommed it! 10,000 for 10 dumplings."
40,"The food didn't failed to meet our expectation, indeed awesome and at affordable price! Except for the soya bean noodle, the other three items on the menu is a MUST-order.  However, the staffs seemed abit unsynchronized and couldn't speak English or Chinese. Took us awhile moving seats twice (we are in a group of eight people), was pretty annoyed in the first place.  However the food is totally great!!! Worth the visit."
50,"This restaurant serves only 4 dishes. We ordered the Gyoza, hot and cold noodles and skipped the porridge since there are only two of us. Love all the three dishes if you like Korean or Chinese food. The restaurant is frequent by the locals and we queued for 20 minutes on a Sunday. Total cost about 28,000 won which is really affordable. Will certainly come back."
50,"We went during lunch hour and service was quick, we hardly waited to be seated! There was only less than 5 items on the menu with English available! We shared a basket of Mandu (dumplings, came in 10 pieces, priced at 10,000 KRW) and Kalguksu (hot soup noodles, 8,000 KRW). One of the best meals ever! And above all, it was very reasonably priced! Definitely worth giving it a try when you are around Myeongdong area!"
40,"Before went to Seoul, I'm searching a lot about Restaurant worth to try and my searching lead me to Myeongdong Kyoja  It's not really hard to find the Restaurant, u can ask people around and they will tell u direction because it's popular among local also tourist  Restaurant very crowded, popular dish is Mandu (Dumpling) KRW 10.000 - 10pcs Kalguksu (Typically noodle with soup base) KRW 8.000, and Bimbim Guksu (Spicy noodle serve cold) KRW 8.000  If you are not a big eater or not really hungry, i suggest u to share because the portion is big my favorite of course mandu, taste nice Kalguksu,soup delicious really perfect for cold weather and about bimbim guksu, if u cannot eat spicy food don't order it. Ask the waiter to help u to cut the noodle, noodle is green colour serve cold and they have chili paste, nuts, cucumber and u mix it together. The taste a little bit sour, sweet and of course spicy. once again it's cold noodle so don't expect it serve hot over all worth to try and recommended"
40,just a few items on the menu but good enough to pack the place.. noodles and dumpling were equally good.. tough gg in big groups
40,"This is one of my favorite kalgooksoo(the noodle soup with thick sliced noodles) place in Seoul. I'm originally from Korea, now living abroad for more than a decade. This is the place where I used go with my friends back in college days. They serve kimchi wit lots of garlic, be aware of its spiciness. It's very spicy, but it's very addictive as well if you love and enjoy spicy food."
40,Cater to tourists obviously as i found out they had multiple outlets around myeongdong just like the cosmetic stores. Serves its purpose by giving tourists a taste od korean dumpling noodles.
30,We had heard a lot of good things about this place and were probably expecting a little too much. There was a choice of four items and the staff were too busy to pay any real attention to customers. Food was ok but only drink available was slightly yellowed water.
40,This is the food that i ate at myeongdong kyoja... (look at the picture below) I forgot the name...but its a noodle in a big bowl with chicken and dumplings It was very yummy and i like it so much The restaurant always very busy and we always queue to enter the restaurant
40,"Easy to get to, very simple menu. In fact a bit too simple with little choice. But, who cares, eat the delicious dumplings which they are known for."
50,"Went into this restaurant by accident as I was looking for some soup comfort food on a cold day in Myeongdong, which was where my hotel was located.  Had the chopped noodles for breakfast (first proper sit down meal in Seoul) and the Bibimguksu for dinner on the night of departing from Seoul.  Having heard about the solo dining culture in Seoul, I was apprehensive about dining in an restaurant but figured that after all gotta experienced it for myself.  On my first visit, it was a weekday morning and the place wasn't crowded so I was shown to a table meant for 2. Was given a menu which had like 4 items and I went straight for the chopped noodles soup. Had wanted to order the dumplings but on 2nd thought decided against it.  Payment was made upon placing my order and within minutes a huge bowl of piping hot noodles appeared in front of me along with a dish of kimchi.  There were 4-5 dumplings in the bowl of noodles so thank goodness I didn't order any extra! Soup was delicious and the noodles were very smooth. I have thought that the kimchi would be the same as what I had always eaten but but but I was so wrong! The refillable kimchi was so so so delicious that I couldn't stop myself from asking for refills from the kind Korean aunty. Honestly I am not a kimchi fan but I was bought over by the kimchi at Myeongdong Kyoja.  Decided that I should try the Bibimguksu before leaving Seoul as there was a bad craving for spicy noodles and I recalled seeing a picture of it during my first visit.  Don't be fooled by the fiery red appearance of the chili paste, it won't burn your mouth or give you fish lips after finishing it up. The noodles were cold and when mixed with the chili red paste, it's a combination beyond words. Other than kimchi, a bowl of soup was also served.  Almost forgot to mention that my 2nd visit took place around dinner time on a Sunday, so it was really crowded and I was placed at a solo dining area where a partition separated me from the diner opposite me.  Highly recommended for a no frills local dining experience if you happened to be in Myeongdong and craving for some noodles or dumplings."
40,Beside Nine Tree hotel and decided to eat here after reading TripAdvisor review. Wanted to order Soymilk noodles but not available. Otherwise ordered the dumpling noodles and steamed dumplings too.
30,My first meal in Seoul today.. Tried the dumplings and the noodle..Not very delicious but not bad. Can try if the queue is not long..
40,Visited the place last Friday. Thankfully no queue. Ordered their dumplings and noodles dishes. As usual the dumplings were delicious. The cold noodles were spicy but just as tasty. Again one of the food I must have each time I visit Korea.
40,"Its dumplings are famous and delicious. I tried it every time I went to Seoul. This time, maybe on Saturday, we had to queue up before being seated. Its dumplings are still very tasty, but a little bit smaller in size, while the texture of the noodles this time was too soft. Well, still worth of trying."
50,"Kargooksoo (literally meaning knife noodles cause traditionally were cut with a large knife) is one of Korea's best noodle dish usually in a beef broth. This one has two locations in Myoungdong, the one closer to the Lotte dept store seems much busier.  I used to eat here once a week as I had some business in Myoungdong regularly. Nowadsays, I still try to eat there about once a month because it is so good. If you and your partner are very hungry good to order the mandoo too otherwise too much food.  The noodles are perfect as well as the broth but the highlight is their kimchi which the most garlicky in Korea. Spicy too but not deathly.  Always busy so try to avoid the busy 12-1 and 6-7 times. Must try it at least once."
40,"This is a nice little restaurant on the shopping street.  It has simple wood tables inside and even simpler menu. There are only 4 disused. Dumplings and three kinds of noodles.  Dumplings are 10,000 and are amazing. You get about 9 or 10 in a plate and they are amazing.  The noodles are okay. The green noodles with red sauce are cold just so you are aware.  You also pay in advance but this with the speedy service just makes the place great for a fast meal.  Overall I enjoyed it but mainly go for the dumplings."
50,"Located in Myeongdong shoppping street, the menu has only 4 dishes and one of them was seasonal dish so I can only try 3. I came there at lunch time so I need to queue up in line and wait for about 15 minutes, at first I though I might need to wait for an hour or so because there were like 20ppl before me but the line goes faster than I though. Me & my friends ordered 2 bowl of chopped noodles, 1 basket of mandu and 1 bowl Cold noodle. The chopped noodles is so delicious, well seasoning, it's quite big so 2 ppl can share one bowl. Cold noodle is spicy but delicious as well, instead of using normal noodle they use matcha flavored one. Our meals only cost 34k won for 5ppl. I'll definitely come back here if I go to Seoul next time"
40,My first time to try their noodles. It's extremely huge bowl for me. The dumpling skin is so thin and didn't break. Generally it is yummy and I will return again during my next visit to myeongdong.
40,I took a walking tour on my first day in Seoul and we passed by the stream. It is picturesque and calm.
50,Very fast service! My Kalgaksu was served piping hot10 seconds after I paid. I went at 8:30pm so was able to get a seat straightaway. Portion was quite big so value for your money. Clean with efficient and polite staff. Highly recommended.
40,Identified as must visit by daughter...kind of Korean fast food...noodle was good and dumpling was ok...kimchi was really hot so beware but i enjoyed the kimchi as it was exciting...
40,The noodle soup is delicious. Not a lot of variety; they only have 3/4 dishes to choose from. But always busy and their service is fast.
50,"I went there to have dîner and we found this place as an excellent place to eat. They don't have many choices of meals (4) but it is just excellent : the dumplings are hand made and very good. The waitress are nice helpful and efficient, you have your order in less than 5 minutes. I strongly recommend this place to taste Korean food"
50,"Busy restaurant, cheap, authentic and good quality. There are only 4 dishes, so the food is super fresh and service very fast."
40,I would say that i had a so so meal. Ate much better tasting dumpling soup in hongkong & shanghai. The place is clean & big tho. Try to come early if you dont want to queue
40,Great restaurant for noodles and dumpling. Price is also good. Very worthed to try as you will get great taste of noodles and dumpling at the best price.
50,"Right in the heart of the bustling Myeongdong shopping district, you'll find this treasure. The restaurant, rightfully so, is packed, yet very efficient. I was seated immediately. Order from the menu your server will bring and pay immediately. Chopsticks and spoons are in the drawer below your table. The kyoja was delicate and delicious. The kimchi was appropriately spicy without being overwhelming. The broth was layered and complex. Very soothing. Highly recommend."
50,If u r in Myeongdong area then this is the place to try some simple yet delicious Korean dishes.  The menu is limited and changes per season but it has well known for cut noodles and dumplings.  The place is also known for its unique flavor of Kimchi.  Must try while in Myeongdong!!!!!
40,"We got our table for 4 adults & 2 kids quite quickly. Our orders came just as quick. Most of us had the hot noodles in soup (Kalguksu) as it was our 1st night in Seoul. It's cold outside! We also ordered the dumplings (Mandu) to share. We love the noodles, very QQ as the chinese would say :P The dumplings are delicious, packed with yummy minced meat. I would say the kimchi is only so so. Service is good and efficient."
50,"Fast service, good food! Don't let the long lines discourage you. The turnover is fast, you'll get a table in no time."
50,"The food is fantastic and the service is fast and attentive!  The bottomless freshly made kimchi has more of a homemade flavour and less of a fermented taste than any other kimchi we have ever had. My mom had plenty of helpings. Of the 6 days in Seoul we came here for 3 meals. The cold noodles are perfect and chewy, the soup was creamy and refreshing. The dumplings have tons of meat but a nice thin skin that let you really taste the spices. The noodle soup was delicious! A must try for anyone who loves dumplings, noodle soups or chewy noodles :)"
30,"The noodles and dumplings were nice but not fantastic compared to good restaurants in Hong Kong or in Singapore. Prices are reasonable but except for weekend afternoons, not really crowded. Place was cramped, overall experience was average."
40,"Well worth the trek though Myeong Dong for it. The limited menu means no need to figure out what to eat - just order dumplings and noodles! The spicy noodles were great too, balanced by the cool julienned cucumber on top. Food was served quickly after ordering piping hot."
50,Dumplings and noodles were delicious. Made a second visit here even with all of the great restaurants in Seoul. Eat here!
50,"This is one of those 'one of a kind' restaurant, which means it is a very unique food in Seoul. No other restaurant comes close to their quality and taste. Noodle may be not too much value for people from other noodle savvy countries (HK, SG, China), but the dumplings certainly delivers its full value."
50,Cant stop thinking about this lunch. The best meal I had in Seoul! the dumplings and kalgasu! Only 4 items but man they know what they are doing! pretty easy as you sit and order and the food comes out in minutes! Also very affordable! I am in love with this place! The kimchee was very spicy but I couldn't stop eating it. they kept asking if I wanted more and I couldn't resist! My lips got swollen later that day from the kimchee due to how spicy but I think I contributed to that since I had 3 servings!
50,This is my second time here and I loved it when I was here five years ago and I loved it this time as well. The kimchi is super garlic-y but sooo good! The noodles may seem a bit bland but it's good when you eat it with the kimchi. Definitely recommend coming here if you're in the area
40,"the place bit hard to find (for me).. but the food was sooo good!! I love it.. will be one of the reason I'll come back to seoul ^^ I maybe not fan of kimchi.. but their kalguksu was so nice, the broth warm and good. very fast service and the price don't ask.. for me its very affordable for a meal and honestly I can't finish it without my friend (hehehe)  But its really worth to searching around myeongdong for a bowl of warm kalguksu"
40,"SETTING: It wasn't the most easy seeking out this restaurant in Myeongdong, where the streets are lined with shops and restaurants, and distracting street food carts. The exterior is really simple, nothing loud, and pretty small. It's easy to miss it.  It was 9pm on a Monday when we visited. We got a table on the second floor. This is the one restaurant throughout our entire 12-day Korea trip where we find ourselves dining with the most tourists. Tourists > locals over in this well-known restaurant. but at least it didn't feel like a usual tourist trap with exorbitant prices and average food. Prices were okay, food was really good. Worth a second visit.  FOOD: Ordered Myeongdong Kyoja chopped noodles (8,000KRW) and the mandoo (10,000KRW).  Loved the texture of the chopped noodles, and the very flavourful soup. Mandoos were big, thin skin, meaty fillings. Really enjoyed the chili here, which goes so well with the mandoos.  We were saving stomach space for more Myeongdong street food so we got the server to pack the last few dumplings for us. Heated them up in the microwave oven for supper that same night, and they still tasted as good."
50,"Cheap restaurant with a delicious food!!! It offers just 3 options of dishes, but you won't need more than that to be satisfied with your choice! I really recommend the pork dumplings and the Kalguksu noodles. It's not a fancy restaurant, but go there for the food!"
30,"This place is CHEAP EATS! Dinner for about $10 USD/person. Dumplings are wonderful. The rest of the 5 item menu, is average. When you place your order they say ""pay now"". Then food comes out immediately. No alcohol on the menu--not even a beer. You can be in and out of here in 30 minutes, easily. Not memorable."
50,"It was so good we went there twice, no alcohol though. Great place to have a quick lunch on a shopping day"
50,"The noodles and dumplings are especially well made, even the kimchi is different. Has a lot more garlic in their dishes (including the kimchi).  It is almost always crowded so be prepared to wait to dine in this restaurant, have the candy after you leave due to the generous use of garlic in their dishes"
50,The noodles were super smooth and the soup was really tasty! The dumplings were ok. They were very big and meaty. The dumpling skin was really thin and soft.
50,"Been to both shops many times & they are both the same. Service at best mediocre but they are efficient. The stars of the show are the dumplings(Mandu) & the super spicy tasty Kimchi. The Mandu is everything you would want in a mouthful, succulent & bursting w flavours, pair that with the super awesome garlicky kimchi in one gigantic bite. One word ""Heaven"". I always make it a point to have 2 baskets of Mandu w plenty plenty kimchi as it's free flow in the shop because when I do my takeaway of Mandus later, they only allow 1 pack of kimchi per order of Mandu. Very Strict, can't buy extra even if you want to. The other soup noodle dish & the chewy cold noodle dish is good too but my focus is always on the Mandus & Kimchi. They should start selling it's kimchi as it's such a unique product in terms of taste that I'm sure many people would buy."
50,Ordered the mandu and kalguksu. You will have to pay first before they serve the food. The food arrived very fast. Both were good but the mandu is outstanding. Highly recommended. Noodle refill is free also.
50,The dumplings! Oh the dumplings! I can't properly describe just how delicious the dumplings are.  It is a very nice hole in the wall (of sorts) and is really cheap! We were a party of 5 and ordered two dumplings and two of the noodle soup and we have more than our fair share of the food and still had some left over.  Service was fast and polite.
40,"I actually chanced upon this place while searching what to eat around Myeongdong area.  The flavour of the soup broth, the springy noodles and the dumplings- with fresh ingredients and abit of the broth in it, every mouth is just delicious!  I will definitely come back again!"
30,"Myeongdong Kyoja is great for a fuss-free, on-the-go dinner in town. This is where to fill up without emptying your wallet.  The greatest part of this restaurant is that they only serve 4 items on their menu. This makes ordering an easy task. It is known for kalguksu, which literally means knife-cut noodles in Korean. Its other speciality is mandu, or steamed pork dumplings. And rest assured, those big, plump, juicy dumplings will fill you up  It’s a good cheap eat in Seoul. When to go? Only the seriously hungry need apply. This is the true truth as I say it as it is…"
50,"This place. Man, you want to talk about quality, this is it. This restaurant in a Myeongdong institution that packs in customers on several floors. Be prepared to wait for quite a bit (unless you have a bigger party) and don't expect friendly personable service. However, if you want some great authentic food, then this is it. The main draw is the kalguksu and the portions of this amazing noodle and dumpling soup are huge. Best of all, you can get refills on the noodles. Be sure to pair it with the mandoo (meat dumplings) and you'll be filled with that toasty feeling in your stomach in no time. I've been here many times and I always have a hankering to return, especially in the frigid Korean winters. Go out and enjoy!"
40,"The shop is not too obvious on the street, as there is only Korean show on the window. You can try the traditional Korean Dumplings, noodles.The taste is quite good."
50,"Good noodles, and free second round refills. Not cheap but good. A bit of wait, long line. In the middle of main shopping district"
40,"Great food, crappy service personnel attitude (I can understand it but still). Long long lines so if you don't mind waiting then it is okay! Feels more like a fast-food restaurant."
40,The shop is full of people but the staff is quick to help us find seats for 12 people. We ordered dumplings and noodles soup. The noodles soup and dumplings is very nice esp during winter. We tried dumplings from other shop but this one is the best! The portion of the noodles shop was big and enough for 2 people sharing. The shop is full with people but the staff is quick to help us find seat.
40,"This place is always packed. Had to wait a fair bit (our group of 7). 3 floors of seating. Order and pay, before you get served your food. Service is quick. Portions are large, a bowl of noodle can serve 2 adults. The gyoza (dumplings) is what people come here for. You will not be disappointed. Kimichi is free flow, but be warned, it is fiery hot. Good kick to your palette."
30,"I've been visiting Myeongdong Kyoja since I was a kid! Our family would frequent here when visiting the Myeongdong Cathedral and I used to order the dumplings. I wasn't a great fan of their noodles until I got older. During the winter, I order the hot Kalgooksu noodles and on hot summer days I order the cold spicy noodles. You can never go wrong with dumplings so we always more than enough. I don't know if it's just me...but it seems like it's not as good as it used to be? I don't go as often because the wait is too long as this place got popular among tourists. Plus, they opened locations in So Cal so I can always visit the ones near my neighborhood. :)"
50,Delicious dumplings & noodles. Serving time is very fast. Location not hard to find & got many place to sit ( not only 1 floor) They also provide mouth wash 👍🏻in the toilet so After eating garlic still smell fresh 😊
30,"It didn't taste particular good. However if you really wanna try Korean gyoza, this would be the place."
40,Only offer 4 food items (2 cold and 2 hot). Since we were here in Winter so we didn't try the cold noodles. The hot noodle in soup and the gyoza are very tasty and good for value. Not very pleasant customer service though but it's ok if you're looking for some quick and different Korean food.
40,"It's quite a long lunch queue but it moves. Only a few items to choose from. We tried the cut noodles soup and the gyoza. It's quite a large portion for Asians. No frills place, eat and go, high customer density."
40,"It was located in the heart of Myeongdong, finding this place was very easy. We ordered the mandu dumplings (10,000 krw) and kalguksu noodles (8,000 krw) the portion were very huge and good for sharing, love the taste of the mandu it was filled with meat and very tasty. The kalguksu noodle for the soup it taste average and the noodles was too soft for me."
40,"Being a fan of all sorts of meat dumplings, I made sure I find this shop and try out the kyoja in myeongdong during my Seoul trip. However, the dumplings were just tasted average. There was no vow factor in this dumplings. This goes the same for the noodle soup. However, what made up to our visit was the garlicky kimchi. They served the most delicious kimchi. Trust me, the kimchi really packed a punch! I sort of regretted for not buying back some of their kimchi ."
40,"After walking the alleys, i stopped into this restaurant, was shown a menu with four dishes on it. I selected the kalguksu noodles and paid 8000 won and within a short time a large bowl with minced meat came with accompanying Kimchee. The soup was delicious, the noodles were very soft and had small dumplings and some vegetables as well. The staff topped up Kimchee as required, there were plenty of tissues available (the kimchee was very spicy). I had intended to try the dumplings (mandu) as well but was very full. I am told it gets very busy but I went there around 8pm and walked straight in."
40,"Very good food, reasonable prices as well. The only downside is the rushing of staff and the eat and leave atmosphere since they are so popular. Seems a bit mechanic but that is to be expected I guess."
50,"We came here based on the TripAdvisor reviews, plus a Korean friend also recommended it. We arrived here pretty late, around 9am (they close at 9.30pm) and it was still full, luckily they had a table available for us. We were keen to order the dumplings, but they were sold out. So, definitely come earlier to try the dumplings! So we settled for the noodles, which also did come with a different kind of dumplings. The noodle dish was really good, it had the right amount of tastiness to it, plus it provided a real sense of comfort to the soul. I would advice to add the sauce that they provide, just to give that extra pop of flavour."
40,Great place for soup noodles with the famous gyoja. This place has possibly the best kimchi in town. Packed during lunch hour.
30,Decently priced dumplings. Restaurant had a English menu and we pretty much got the 2 most popular dishes.
20,"Firstly, i'd looked forward to meal for a while since been in korea due to the hype on Trip Advisor but was quite disappointed and went for lunch in the end on the last day. The service was fairly minimal with payment being expected first; the food came very promptly within 5 mins. The food itself was mainly the disappointment as the dumplings were pretty bland and dry. They were poorly constructed with the pastry being broken at the base on most of them before handling with the internal juices being pretty much absent. Pretty much broke every rule of making the perfect dumpling. The spicy noodle were really salty and spicy, the cucumbers gave a bit of freshness too bt still pretty poor. The beef noodles on the other hand were definitely, the best with the soup having pretty good amount of beef flavour to it bt seriously lacking in actually beef with some scraps. The noodles themselves were really soggy and appeared overcooked as the fell apart pretty easily. Overall, poor service and food, wouldnt recommend a visit."
50,"Turnover is fast, so just be patient and wait. The noodle serving is huge, order and share. Menu limited. There are 3 floors."
40,"Interesting restaurant that serves only 3 dishes during winter. But the kyoja and noodles are really well done. Best of all, good price! Turnover fast so it's not a place to rest and chat though"
40,"I went to this restaurant a few times during my stay in Seoul, just because it's a good place for a solo traveler to feed and I am one big noodles lover. It has long lines during peak hours to get in. There are only about 5 options on the menu. To be perfectly honest, I don't get why this place is so popular. The noodles are OK by my standard, far from perfect. Actually, the noodles are too soft, way too soft. It doesn't have a soul in it (by soul I mean the chewy texture that makes noodles really tasty), which is very import for devoted noodle lovers like me. It's like the leftover noodles or overcooked noodles. Aside from the noodles itself, the service is good and efficient, the place is clean, and last but not the least, it's in a perfect location."
30,"Heard many good reviews on this restaurant, so despite the cold weather and rain, made it to the restaurant. Very pack and congested, more like a fast food outlet. Staff are not so friendly. Noodles are good though but the dumplings are so so only. Not many items to choose from."
40,Simple and Fuss Free Menu. Just 3-4 items to choose from and the kyoja cum soup base indeed lived up to its name!
50,"The best food for cold Seoul winter. The dumpling is filled with a lot of delicious meat and the wrap is thin unlike others. The knife cut noodle soup is hearty and delicious, it sure will warm you up right away. Both the locals and tourists loves to dine here. The all you can eat kimchi is delicious and the ahjumas are very friendly with kids. At lunch time the que is long so try to come a little earlier or after lunch time. There are several branches in myeong dong and usually people eat here at a fast pace so it is quite convenient for a quick meal. Do not bring a lot of shopping bags as the restaurants are quite cramped."
40,"Wow wow wow! For authentic warm noodles in broth, dumplings and the most spicy and original kimchi this decades old establishment is the place to go.  I was too busy to sit and eat we got dumplings and kimchi to go. Noodles aren't a to go option as they will bloat up.  I was in kimchi heaven as this is the most spicy and garlicky stuff you ever had. They make it using only the most inner layers of a special cabbage and I believe the recipe is a close guarded secret. It is just amazing stuff and I would eat it just with white rice.  Nearby establishments have formed for amazing gelato and bakery nearby. There is also an acoustically impressive cathedral nearby. Of course shopping in that area also has a ton of options and a dept store nearby."
50,"There are only a few items on the menu. We tried the dumplings and noodle in hot soup for 3 of us. It's portion is great and satisfying. They have a large number of locals and tourists visiting this shop. In one alley, there are 2 shops. People typically eat and go and no queues at all. Try it!"
40,"Came here based on TA reviews. Dumplings remind me of chinese xiaolongbao but without the yummy soup.  Good in its own way. Noodles are huge serving and silky. Pretty decent as well. A little over hyped as best dumpling or must try, i would say plenty other stuff to eat in seoul. But if you happen to be nearby, worth a visit.  Line is extremely long both downstairs and up, but dont be intimated. Moves very quickly."
50,Great food! Only a few types of dishes in this restaurant but it is definitely worth repeated visits! The gyoza is nice and the noodles soup is great! The cold spicy buckwheat noodles is also great! Nothing bad to say about this restaurant at all. Service is great and they are fast and attentive to your requests as well! :)
40,Only ordered 2 dishes for 3 person in the afternoon and end up with full happy tummy because of their remarkable kyoja menu. Perfect dishes during fall and winter season and after a tiring day walking aroung myeongdong. Should visit this restaurant again when i go back to Seoul.
30,"Honestly, it just a noodle soup with dumpling. I think it worth visiting if you walk around Myeongdong. The taste was ok, but it was not that good if you come here only for noodle.  There are only 3 dishes on menu. noodle soup, cold noodle and dumpling serve with kimchi. Lot of people like it. Probable i am not a noodle fan."
40,"명동교자의 만두와 칼국수는 설명이 필요없고, 이곳의 김치는 매운생마늘냄새때문에 처음엔 거부감이 들 수 있지만 한 번 먹어본다면 이곳의 김치만 맛보러도 가고싶을 정도.  Quite a busy restaurant but they sell the BEST dumplings and noodle here. However, this is not the right place for vegetarians and for those who hates garlic.  *You have to pay when you order. They accept credit cards, too. *Dont eat kimchi here if you cant deal with raw garlic or spicy food."
40,"Nice, efficient, friendly service. The noodles and dumplings were good. Kimchi - truly original Korean and great tasting. Restaurant had great local vibe to those who want to experience."
50,"I tried both the soup and the spicy noodles but the soup was absolutely out of this world. One of the best soups I've ever had. Comes with four dumplings and ground beef on top. The noodles are perfect, and the broth is heavenly. Liked it so much I came back three times. Favorite food in Seoul so far."
40,"Noodle was so smooth! Best noodle I had so far! Dumpling was yummy, and the Kimchi and chillies were very good too! Highly recommend!"
50,"It was quite hard to look for the small entrance to this building, but this place should definitely be visited when in Seoul! They seem to observe the ""pari-pari"" culture where the servers move at lightning speed. After ordering what we wanted from the menu that only had 4 dishes, the dumplings and bowls of noodle soup were in front of us within 30 seconds (not exaggerating!). The place is always packed, but with three floors, you're bound to get a table within the next 15 mins or so."
40,"Nice hot dumpling noodles on cold winter day ! Bowl of mince meat noodle soup cost W8000, steam dumplings (xiao long bao) a tray of 10 pieces cost W10000. Kimchi that accompanied the noodle was fantastic, full of garlicky flavour and lots of spice"
40,"The dumplings were giant!! Steamed type and great tasting. We had the chicken soup noodles. The soup was really good for a cold day although we were not great fans of the noodles. We had our dumpling fix though!  Apparently they changed their names a few times cos others were trying to ""pass off"" them. We did see other similar set ups in Myeongdong, so useful to ensure u get the right one. I wonder why the original had to change names but well..."
50,Second time to eat here. Last time I was here was 2012. This place serves the best dumpling! Their noodle soup is good too. To avoid the long lines go there before lunch time. We went there at 11am. Must visit!
40,the dumplings were just ok for me.. too much green onion for me.. but the hot wonton noodles were delicious.. I would go back just for the noodles.. we didn't try any cold noodles.
50,"It's a must to try their steam dumpling and noodle soup. Don't finish the soup so fast, you can ask for extra serving of noodle for free. The steam dumpling was bigger and tastier than those we tried in other area but also much pricier. You will need to make payment immediately after ordering at your table."
50,"Awesome dumplings (boiled style and not fried).. Soup noodles was nice too, but found noodles a little starchy though the soup was great for cold winter...  The kimchi was really special, had many different styles of kimchi but loved this best in this trip  Menu is pretty limited but good for what they specialize in"
50,"The menu only had 3 items -- the kagilsku (noodle soup), spicy cold noodles and steamed dumplings (something like mandu/siomai/gyoza). We ordered all 3 and were all good. At first I was a little put off by the spicy noodles because it was served cold, but I soon realiz d that it went well with my soup.  This is an efficient place that once you are seated, you tell the wait staff what you want from the menu and they can immediately give you a reciept/ticket for you to pay. Food was served within a few mins.  We had brunch here on a Sunday morning and the place was full (from what I can tell most are locals so that is def a good sign)  Def a great place to eat in between the shopping"
10,I don't know why so many people like this food there. The taste isn't delicious. Stuff is very unfriendly and it's really dirty there.
50,Yummy food but a bit pricey. Definitely must try when in Seoul. Great food for cold weather. Go on and try it!
40,"Not easy to find even if in a very busy street. Small menu with only four items but that is enough dumplings and noodles We had the noodles soup, green cold noodles and two portions of dumplings. A bit too much but we were hungray. All that for 30 euro, they do not have beer or other drinks, you do get water. Tasty and fast, you first pay and then the food. Simple place, clean, menu has pictures and english text. Portions of noodles are big, dumplings are 10 pcs"
50,"This is a good place for noodles and dumplings. I really enjoyed the noodles, dumplings and kimchi. All are well prepared and tasty. The place itself can feel a bit cramped and rushed so it's not a place for special occasions or a romantic candle lit dinner, but definitely worth a visit. I will certainly visit again!"
40,"Yummy and good quality noodle and dumpling. Not to be missed and especially smooth noodle, lots of ingredients in the soup noodle and friendly staffs. Place is clean and warm"
20,"This being near our hotel and one of the most highly rated dumpling places in Seoul, I took my family here a few weeks ago.  The place was almost packed, and we ordered man-doo(dumplings in Korean) and Kal-gook-soo(flat noodle soup).  Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant. While the service was good and the food came out quick, the food wasn't great. I like kim-chi, but the kim-chi here was way too spicy and the man-doo and kal-gook-soo had too much salt. The girls really didn't eat much and we ended up going to another place nearby."
30,"In my opinion, the food is average, the price is okay. But the visitor is endless. Maybe it just me that dont like a soup noodle. They only sell 3 menu. Hot noodle, soya noodle and gyoza"
30,"Came to this place due to the good reviews uncovered. I had the dumpling noodle soup (topped with minced meat) - quite like the taste of the dumplings but not the strangely chewy noodles .  Overall, I feel the noodle soup was ok - maybe you want to try the steamed dumplings - it may be better than the noodle soup.  Do try to go during the off peak hours (before lunch hour/ after) to avoid the crowd and queue."
50,"I don't know how to describe this in words but whenever I remember about their dumpling, My mouth will start watering. Free flow spicy Kim Chi too!"
40,"It will miss to comeback only for this Kyoja really expensive of food you have hahahahha... but they serve nice one, i choose vegetable and its better eat with alot of people who love it, 1 portion is 10 big like the picture."
50,"Found in Myeongdong where is its namesake is a very famous korean restaurant which has been patronized by thousands of locals and foreigners who have more or less heard about the tasty food found therein.  It was around 7pm during a mild winter period that we were there and we had to wait a around 15 minutes for a seat as the place was positively packed. Where i come from, a packed restaurant is always worth checking out.  We were shown to our seats quickly and orders were taken quickly as well. You see, there are only about 6-8 items on the menu so its not really wise to spend too much time deciding. We picked the 3 items that seems to be the most famous or at least close to our palates and hoped for the best.  And we were not disappointed. We were actually here after another dinner we had elsewhere and just wanted to try this for the heck of it due to its reputation online. We were actually quite full by then and of the 6 of us , we ordered 3 items, the Kyoja, the Bibimguksu and the Kalguksu. And long story short, we finished all of it.  The Kyoja, which is a must order dish when you're here, is the equivalent of chinese meat dumplings but bigger. Made of buckwheat, the dumplings are stuffed with pork. leek and sesame oil and best had with some vinegar. The taste is juicy and sweet with each bite and you'll not stop at one.  The Bibimguksu, is a cold noodle dish made of wheat. Its mixed with marinade soybean sauce which is equal terms sour, sweet, spicy and salty and garnished with cucumbers and sesame. Mix the noodles well and enjoy an extremely appetizing bliss in your mouth thereafter. The noodles are cold, chewy and elastic which adds a whole new dimension of texture. The marinate and cucumbers also help elevate the dish to be a great appetizer for even more food. Excellent.  The last dish was the Kalguksu, which is kinda like noodle soup with wantons. Even this tasted great with the clear broth which i'm not sure if it was boiled with seafood or meat prior. I had one taste and already quite liked it.  Overall, this place is absolutely worth visiting for a quick fuss free meal. Do note that it was winter when we visited and hence our appetites were much greater then normal.  Verdict: Worth Queuing 15 minutes For"
50,"Traditional Korean restaurant with the finest dumplings and foods nearby! A bit hard to find in the crowded shopping area but it's definitely your fault if you miss it! Wow! Kind and super fast service, neat table, reasonably prices! Of course due to the popularity long queue may occur, that's why after ready with your meal advisable to leave promptly."
40,"Went to both the main and branch in myeongdong on separate visits to Seoul. Some swear the food quality differs at each outlet, but it seems the same to me. Expect long queues especially during peak hours, but the queue clears fast, since they only have 4 staple items on the menu, and the restaurant isn't exactly conducive for a leisurely meal and chat. Tables are arranged rather close, restaurant is often packed and noisy, your orders arrive almost immediately, and you pay when your order is taken. The dumplings and noodles are satisfying, comfort-food for us, though not something we would gush over. Portions are generous. We ordered a bowl of noodles and a steamer of dumplings, which we found hard to finish."
30,It's good ! Local Korean Mandu with kimchi . Very simple place located in heart of city . It's delicious .
40,"This is a must eat restaurant serves only limited choice of foods. But the noodles soup and dumplings are irresistible delicious and that is why I went back the second time within 3 days. Price has gone up since my last visit and now the price for noodle soup is 8,000won and dumplings is 10,000won respectively."
40,"Wandered past this place while shopping, and didn't realize that it was such a popular spot! The menu is limited: mandu (dumplings), noodle soup, and spicy noodles, but they do these things very well. Got one order of dumplings and soup, which was more than enough for two people. It all tasted good, nothing exceptional (I find that all mandu kind of tastes the same), but it was great for the price!"
50,I always visit whenever I go to Myung Dong. Very famous place for noodles and also good dumplings too there's always waiting lines on meal time. 여름엔 콩국수도 정말 맛있습니다. 항상 같은맛을 유지하고 양도 푸짐합니다. 명동 뿐 아니라 서울 최고의 칼국수 음식점 입니다
40,"Their menu has Mandu, cold noodle and hot soup noodle. The Mandu comes in 10 pieces per order. They are very meaty. The meat is tender, sweet and slightly juicy. The skin of Mandu is paper-thin and soft. In fact the Mandu here tastes better than the Xiao Long Bao at Din Tai Feng. The hot soup noodle is fantastic. The noodle is knife-sliced and it is silky smooth and soft. The soup is very tasty and you don't feel thirsty after eating it. The noodle comes with fried minced pork and a few mini dumplings. The whole combination tastes perfect. The portion of noodle is quite big and can be shared among 2 persons, if you are a small eater.  Worth the visit."
30,"We went for lunch, the place was packed with mostly locals. Service was very quick, the dumplings and cold noodles tasted ok, but nothing extraordinary. I couldn't understand the hype or why it was such a popular restaurant except the price was very reasonable. If you like cheap and fast, this is the place to eat mediocre noodles and dumplings. I wasn't impressed."
50,Maybe the most delicious meal I had in Seoul. So tasty very quick and super simple. What fast food should be!
50,It is quite easy to locate this restaurant in the busy Myeongdong shopping district. Ordered the soup noodles and dumplings. Enjoyed every bit of the food. It is so delicious! Paid about SGD30 for 2 bowls of noodles and 1 tray of dumplings.
40,"A few menus are available here. In my opinion, the taste of noodle soup and dumpling are quite normal, unless you take it with their Kimji. Slightly spicey Kimji with fine chop of garlic makes the taste much better.  Be careful as the dish size is quite large. The dumpling is also serves in large portion (10 pcs). Make sure you have enough room in your stomach before visiting this place. Staffs are friendly and ready to fill up kimji for you."
50,"its worth to eat here. located in Myeongdong. from Myeongdong station exit 8, turn left, enter the Myeongdong area, just walk straight about 4 minutes, until you find it on your right."
50,I read many review about this restaurant and I said to myself that I should eat this. Service is OK. A lot of customer but you I don't need to queue. Food is delicious. One of my favorite restaurant. Definitely will go back to this restaurant when I travel to Seoul again.
50,"A local friend recommended us this restaurant for the mandoo and kalguksu (chopped noodle soup). And it turns out to be one of the very best meal we ever had. The portion is huge so we had to share. The taste is very delicious! Very different than the mandoo we tried in Jakarta. The Kalguksu (the noodle soup) is also very delicious, good to warm us in winter cold weather. We recommend the mandoo together with kalguksu. Just be prepared to wait in line as the restaurant is very famous among tourists and locals."
50,This restaurant was recommended to me by my sister. She used to study Seoul for 2 years. Gyoza was delicious. It is a must order dish. Others were 3 different type of noodles. We ordered all of them. They were all good depends on your preference. They only have 5 menus in total so it will not be hard to pick one.
40,The steam dumplings are very good and hot noodles served are equally great. It good be a wonderful experience if the staff were a little bitter friendly. Nevertheless don't miss this eatery.
40,They have a very limited menu. One sort of dumplings and three types of noodles. One portion of dumplings has ten pieces. They are delicious but it is hard for me to finish ten dumplings by myself. It is therefore a place better for sharing.
40,"My friend led me to here and didn't let me down, the flavor is pretty fitting Chinese appetite, we also ordered noodle but I forgot it's name, I love the soup, you must try!"
30,Average food. Not a place for quiet dinner. Very congested table setting. Staff not attentive. Quite a stressful experience.
50,I knew this as Myeongdone Kalguksu but apparently it changed its name and rightly so because the gyoza was a winner! I remember he noodle soup was just delicious but on this trip the gyoza stood out. They had this special non spicy sauce and it was awesome with ththe dumplings.
50,"I visit this restaurant every time I come to Seoul. Ordering food is easiest here since they only have 4 main items, with clear photographs of the meals. The hot noodle soup is comforting, with a rich and flavoursome broth. The noodles are well-textured. On separate occasions, I had the spicy cold noodles which were exceptional too. Well balanced spiciness, and noodles had a great bite! Noodle portions here are quite generous. The kimchi served here, is the best, among others served in most restaurants. It has a distinct sparkle, with a strong matured garlic hit. I heard that it is flavoured with sea salt and matured for 3 years (yet to be verified). Indeed I enjoy the kimchi here most. And the kind waitresses top up the empty kimchi dish gladly when you make a request for it.  I brought 2 friends along for this visit, and they too enjoyed their noodles, dumplings and kimchi!"
40,"Foods are great. You will never have any agony with ordering any on the menu, especially dumplings. But you should ready for vast crowds, long waiting line, and very busy servers who rarely care for you."
40,"I had to try this ever famous dumpling in the Myeondong area. It was indeed very good. They have 2 locations in the Myeondong area. We tried to get there at 10am and we were seated right away. However, there was a long line after we left."
40,"We had to try out this restaurant since it had been in business since 1966. The tasty noodles mixed with meats and vegetables were pretty good and in fact, I think they were better than the dumplings which my friend was raving out. I prefer the Chinese dumplings which are not as heavy as these ones. Nevertheless, a nice place to try out as the food here is good and cheap. The service, btw, was fast and efficient. And the waitress spoke excellent English! It can get busy if you don't come early. We went at 11am for lunch and when we got out an hour later, the place was packed. Come early!"
40,We had 3 meals in the restaurant. The steam dumplings are great. The hot and cold noodles served are equally great. Don't miss this eatery.
50,"We had an order of their Mundo and guksoo. Mundo was tender and tasty, guksoo noodles were made in a beef broth and savory. The large pot of kimchee was delicious!! I think we had about half the large bowl between us."
30,"The dumplings taste just normal, nothing really special. However the noodles is really good, and their kimchi tastes great! It's a place worth the money."
30,No complains. Centrally located - It's a must go place in myeongdong to serve nice warm noodles. Service is really fast given that the choices are limited with the menu restricted to the must try dishes - Noodle and dumplings.
30,"I had great expectations from this place as there's always a long queue. Ordered mandu (dumplings) and guksu (noodles) which the place is famous for. The food was good but nothing that blew me away. I honestly do not understand all the hype. Their kimchi is way overloaded with garlic, which I did not enjoy."
50,"This restaurant is loved by locals and is always packed with loxals and tourists alike. The noodles are great tasting and the dumplings are also a must try. It is a pay-first served-later system. The kimchi is much hotter and has more garlic than typical so beware. Extra servings of noodles and soup is free if requested, so I recommend that for 2 people one bowl of noodles and one dish of dumplings, insteas of a bowl of noodlea each. Kimchi and rice is also free and continuously served. Very busy and perhaps unfriendly atmosphere, but you can try absolutely great local noodles and dumplings for a low price. Must visit for locals and tourists alike when visiting Myeongdong."
50,"Very nice food, the dips were great. The menu is rather small, but very good. Service is fast.. highly recommended if you are in Myeongdong area"
50,"In continuation of my top 5 food which I had in Seoul, below is the list  1) Mukshidonna - Army stew @ Samcheongdong 2) The Original Pancake House @ Garosugil 3) Myeongdong Kyoja Main Branch @ Myeongdong 4) Kyochon Fried Chicken @ Gangnam 5) Tosokchon Samgyetang Ginseng Chicken @ near Gyeongbokgung  Though this place is famous for their dumplings, their Kalgusu (noodles), is what took my breath away. The noodles are so soft and spongy and it is really a delicacy. I had my fair share of Kalgusu at Nandaemun Kalgusu Alley but the one here, easily beat them hands down. The broth is fantastic and flavourful. The dumplings were not too bad either. The restaurant is very specialise,what u see at the front door with only 4 pics, thats all they sell here! hahaha we had a good laugh among us when we saw their menu. But boy do they do their specialisation well.  Biggest tip to those who read this! As we were sat besides locals, I realised they provide free service of topups of noodles and broth!! not the dumplings though, please thats really too much if u think that can be refilled haha.. When i asked for a refill, initially the staff thought I wanted to order another bowl, till I ask for the free topup then they gave me! They must be shocked (dunno if pissed off haha) that a tourist learn the local technique of free noodles! Furthermore, the free portion is one full serving! so save you quite abit of money as u can just order one bowl and refill it hahaha. hope this helps!"
50,This place is a real gem. There is almost always a line but the turn over is so fast that Ive never waited for more than 5 or 10 minutes. They will ask you to pay before you receive your food which makes the whole process quick and efficient. The kalguksu and mandu (dumplings) are the true stars of the show. Both dishes come out hot and delicious every time. For a two people one order of kalguksu and one order of mandu will usually be enough but if not you can always add more noodles if you have leftover broth. If you want to try something new the cold noodles are a very refreshing change of pace. I highly recommend this place for a quick and delicious meal!
50,"This place specializes in just a few dishes, but man do they specialize. Definitely a must visit in myeongdong."
40,"The dumplings with the garlic sauce were great. The noodle soup is very filling. The price is very reasonable for the food given. Found it from tripadvisor, pretty easy to find with Google Maps. They opened a little before 10:30 on the Saturday I went."
40,"Simple food at very reasonable prices. You had 4 choices, water, and free kimchi. Tried their dumplings and kalguksu. We liked the dumplings and would recommend the place for a quick meal."
40,"I guess there's a reason a restaurant can boast a 50 year history. Extremely popular, so as often as not very busy, what I loved is the choice - there are just four things on the menu. I went for the kalguksu and we shared some dumplings, both of which were lovely and arrived very quickly. The kimchi was the fiercest I had anywhere in Korea!"
40,"Simple menu with only a few dishes, water to drink and all the kimchi you want. Quick ordering, paying, bringing out the dishes. The flavors are intense and superb. Worth multiple visits for a no frills and delicious meal."
30,"Heard that it was a famous restaurant and tried it wasnt bad but i wouldnt say spectacular. Tried the dumplings, being asian chinese it was average. Tried some soy bean cold noodles it was not our taste. Maybe their kalguksu is good"
40,We decided to check out this place since it had many good reviews and we were close by. The food is good although there are only a few dishes available. Nice experience surrounded by mainly Korean customers.
50,"This is the best place for lunch in the area. The quick service, affordable pricing, and unlimited Kim chi should be enough to bring you back a second time. We ordered three spicy noodle, noodle soup and dumplings. All were delicious and definitely recommended. Only water is served here."
40,"Don't be too concerned if you see a long queue, it moves quite fast and I was seated within ten mins of waiting. The menu only had four dishes, with pictures and the briefest of English explanations. I don't know how often the menu changes but I picked the pork dumplings and the spicy (cold) noodles. You pay on order and wait a few minutes for it to arrive. You get ten dumplings from what I can recall, so it's best shared. Both dishes were very tasty and I can highly recommend it for a quick meal. If you want a calm, relaxing dinner go somewhere else!"
50,"very very yummy kalguksu (hand cut noodles) very thick delicious and comforting broth, chewy noodles.  the dumplings were alright, but not as inspiring as the kalguksu.  the kimchi was fiery to say the least! very full of garlic flavor... the ""spiciest"" kimchi i've had in korea (in a garlicky way :) )  highly recomended"
40,"This restaurant is near with my guesthouse.. I dont recognize at the first time but when i cross the street i saw the menu and the situation inside was very busy I try the noodle and dumpling.. The broth is light and they have a thin noodle i love it.. Also the dumpling has a thin skin.. After you order, you should pay first.. The restaurant is beside the skin care cosmetic... (Sorry cant remember the name) I will eat here again if im come back to korea"
50,We just ordered the main three dishes on the menu. The noodle with soup was great and the soup wasn't too salty. The cold noodle was a bit too strong for us (we were having that as our breakfast). The kyoja was the best out of all! Definitely recommend!
50,"The chicken noodle is awesome. If you love noodle, This is a unique product in between ramen and chinese noodle. Very tasty. Very Delicious. Kimji also very delicious and unique. A must to eat in Korea"
30,"Ordered the cold soyabean broth noodles and a plate of dumplings. The dumplings are stuffed full of meat so that's good. Noodle was so-so, no meat and healthy soybean broth. Tasted bland though. I think this is over-rated, not cheap too. The dumpling dish and noodle set me back by almost 20000 won for 1 person."
50,There are two outlets at myeongdong.  1. Opp olive young u wld see milky bee walk along the street. The shop is on your right. Next to H&M.. this shop not so easy to recognize if you dont read korean.  2. Walk futher down you would see a hotel on your right and the shop is on your left. This shop has the web address on the shop front  Solo dinning so didnt try the spicy noodle or dumpling.  The soup noodle is yummy. Kimichi is superb too. Staff will offer to top up your kimichi.  Per bowl $8000won
50,There are so many korean restaurants in my country but there's no restaurant like Myeongdong Kyoja! It was fantastic! So tasty! Are you looking for delicious korea noodle? This place will be your favorite!
50,Loved the food Noodles and dumplings The menu is small but the food was great and the food prices were reasonable. The reviews I read about the restaurant were very much on point
50,"Kalguksu and mandu are one of the best meals I had in Seoul. Mandu is filled with lots of vegetable and you can eat all of them by yourself. (If you walk a lot before, or hungry, I mean) Kalguksu is similar to udon that you can eat in Japan, noodles are thinner and lighter. The dish is served very quickly, so you do not have much waiting time. The cost of one meal is reasonable, so I would recommend this place if you have any space in your stomachs."
50,"Ate upstairs, ordered in a timely manner with no wait. Food came out very quickly. So delicious. We ate the traditional noodles (Chopped Noodles) and had an order of their dumplings."
50,"Traditional Korean restaurant with the finest dumplings and foods nearby! A bit hard to find in the crowded shopping area but it's definitely your fault if you miss it! Wow! Kind and super fast service, neat table, reasonably prices! Of course due to the popularity long queue may occur, that's why after ready with your meal advisable to leave promptly."
50,"Ordered a tray of mandoo and a bowl of noodles to be shared between two persons and it was perfect. Any more and it would be too much for 2 females. The mandoos were good, especially when eaten with the soybean paste provided. I also tried the cold noodles with soybean broth which was alright but my friend didn't enjoy it, it's definitely not a dish for everyone. The restaurant is always packed so visit before peak hours if you don't wish to queue!"
50,"simple fare - dumpling and noodles. dumplings are tasty and filling is thinly wrapped in its skin, certainly worth a try. big tables may take abit of waiting but generally turnover is quick."
40,"They have straight forward menu : wonton noodle and green dumpling.  The noodle soup is tasty, and the wonton is fantastic. Delicious.  The service is quick, while the price is not expensive.  It's a gem in the Myeongdong shopping street.  Direction to this restaurant : use subway and stop at Myeongdong (exit 8) > turn left onto Myeongdong 10-gil Road > Go straight about 150m."
50,"This is a super delicious korean noodle try it's located in myeongdong and you can find it so easy go to red vest guys and ask where to go, they will let you know! It's around EXIT8 Wanna try it again !!!"
40,"After forgoing the long wait and opting for other restos, I finally got myself to check out this landmark in Myeongdong. The wait wasn't long, because I went at an odd hour in between mealtimes. The noodles and broth were as yummy as anticipated as were their dumplings. As a Korean, I loved the potent garlic flavor offered at this establishment. No regrets."
40,"Nice place for breakfast as they don't have much varieties, only 4 dishes available. Kyoja (dumplings), Sour & Spicy Soup, Cold Noodles (Spicy) and Plain broiled Soup Noodles. Very strategic location, at the middle of the Myeogdong shopping street."
30,"while the food is by no means bad, they are not superb either. the gyoza/mandu is big and juicy but i find the flavor very monotonous. the soup noodle again is of massive portion but nothing to really shout about. I also find the kimchi in this place abit too strong for my own liking  service is however prompt and price is also reasonable. not a place I will visit purposely for its food"
40,"Perfect place to refuel and take a break from the shopping frenzy. We stopped by for lunch and was quickly seated upstairs. The menu is short with four items, but honestly that’s all you'll need! We ordered the kalguksu noodles (hand chopped noodles) and mandu dumplings, which came within minutes. The noodles really hit the spot; they were the perfect consistency and were served with dumplings, minced pork, and vegetables. I loved that the mandu had a very thin skin and was stuffed with plenty of juicy pork and vegetables. We liked the mandus so much that we ordered a round two! Overall, the service is quick and terse but the food more than makes up for that. Plus, their kimchi was amazing! Would definitely visit again."
40,Great taste by seeing the crowd. Those cannot take hot kimchi pls try to dilute the chilli first. Didnt try the dim sum gyoza but look tasty too. W8000 per bowl of noodle
30,I like this place. Noodle is good and dim sum is great but garlic is very strong. Kimchi also very strong
50,My wife and I had dinner here on our short visit to seoul. The food was very tasty and the atmosphere was good. The service was prompt and the waitress spoke good english. It was also very popular! I would recommend the dumplings!
50,"We love the noodles. They are so soft and smooth. The soup was tasty but not too salty which really suits out taste. The dumplings are nice as well. However, the kimchi was a bit too spicy. They also provided chewing gums for us. Overall, we are very satisfied with the food and service."
40,"This venue lived up to my expectations. I wanted authentic, simple and healthy Korean food. I got it. There is only four items on the menu. I had pork dumplings and spicy noodles (vegetarian). Total cost KRW18,000 (GBP12.00)!! You can pay by credit card. You have to order and then pay. The food is delivered very quickly. No alcohol. It's a place to eat quickly even with family. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to all."
50,"Typical Korea food lots of barbecue, wrap and roll. We had a very good meal here. You can order raw fish to dip in different kinds of sauce they have here in Korean as well. Love it"
40,"This place has been very popular for old school noodle and dumpling. There are only a handful of dishes in the menu and many people queue for the unchanged and great taste. This is not a fancy place at all and people are expected to eat and leave to cater many people in the queue quickly. The service is very quick and great value for money. If this place was nearby my home, I would definitely go there a few times ever week !"
50,"WOW! Here's one of our best dining experiences in Korea. This is a no frill old school noodle joint, with only a few things on the menu, but all are absolutely tasty with very fast serving time. Price was also very reasonable. Highly recommended."
50,"I went there on my first day in Seoul while it was raining, just follow the Google map and you'll be able to find it. It was a little corwded and there were a lot of tourists who ate there, thankfully I was seated almost immediately. Be sure to know your basic Korean, I was lost in translation when the lady who serves asked is she gave me the change already, good thing a helpful customer stepped in. By the way, they give you candy before you start so you could eat it after"
30,Fast and delicious Kind of expensive but good I think that at least one time you better visit here
40,"The dumplings were average but the kongkuksu (noodles in white bean sauce) was excellent. It was the best kongkuksu I ever had. For those of you who are unfamiliar with Korean cuisine, this restaurant is famous for its meat dumplings and kongkuksu (noodles in white bean sauce). The noodles are purposely made bland, so you should pour salt on them and mix the noodles in the white bean broth.  Overall I give this place 4 stars if you like kongkuksu. If you like dumplings you might be slightly disappointed. No variety and mediocre. Also, as someone who lived in Seoul I think the wait is not worth it."
50,"Noodles and dumplings are handmade and deliciously chewy, smooth and soft to bite. Broth is rich in shallots while kimchi has a rich garlic flavour. There are two outlets along myeongdong. Great place for meals with fast turnover rate! Staff service is also polite, swift and attentive. Been here numerous times. Will return again."
40,"Yes this is a four story restaurant in the densely bustling center of Myungdong area of Old Seoul, South Korea. The restaurant occupies the entire four stories and every seat is packed almost the whole day, evening and even late night. The place is famous for mandoo which is another word for kyoza which is another word for dumpling... About an inch round ball shaped dumplings are served in wooden/bamboo steam containers, piping hot when served, to be dipped in some soy sauce with some ground red peppers. Sometimes the wait is a half hour, sometimes it seems an eternity. Is it worth the idle wait in the heat? Well, ask the zillions and zillions of former customers."
50,"Although it was extremely crowded and there was a que, we only waited for 5-6mins. Nice place, reasonable price, good food. What else?"
40,"Strategically placed within the consumer labyrinth of Myeongdong, Myeongdong Kyoja is a perfect place to take a break from the shopping and have a great meal. Located down the road from the iconic Myeongdong cathedral, this restaurant deserves to be an icon itself. The service is very respectful and very helpful for non Korean speakers like myself. We ordered every dish on the menu such as the favorites, Kalguksu and Mandu, as well as Bibimguksu, and the seasonal summer specialty Kongguksu. Alongside we were given their popular, and apparently famous kimchi. Starting with the Kalguksu, these chopped noodles in a meaty broth was very simple, hearty, and satisfying. The Mandu dumplings must be where this restaurant gets its fame. They were big and juicy and are strong contenders for my favorite dumplings of all time. Both the Bibimguksu and Kongguksu are refreshing cold dishes that are perfect for hot weather. The kimchi was a different story for me. Now I am far from a kimchi connoisseur, but I personally felt the kimchi was completely overpowered by a pungent garlic taste. It became difficult to eat because the garlic would dominate the entire meal. Nonetheless, the strong kimchi and this restaurant as a whole, are a must try."
50,Hands down this is a must go ... Cheap food .. Fast service ... Tasty food ... Everyone knows the place ... And pleasuring food after intense night of party 😍😍😍😍😍
50,I went for the dumplings and they were jeongmal mas-issneun (really delicious)! I thought it was not too expensive and it really filled me up satisfyingly. The service was really prompt as well. The staffs were mostly very attentive and I managed to get a seat quite immediately.
40,"We went to Myeondong Kyoja specifically to eat kongguksu and we were not disappointed. They have other three items on the menu but unfortunately they all have meat: mandu (dumplings), kalguksu and bibimguksu, although for this last one you can order without the meat. Anyway the kongguksu alone is worth the visit. The broth is rich and thick, packed with flavour. The noodles are green since they use chlorella. The service and the atmosphere might not be the best but it's all worth it, you'll see. By the way, the kimchi here is not only very spicy, but also packed with garlic so you might need some gum afterwards. You can have a small bowl of rice to eat with the kimchi, free of charge. One of the staff is constantly going around offering kimchi refills."
50,The dumplings are good and worth trying. The service staff are very efficient in finding a table for you.
50,"This spot is my first go-to spot when I visit Seoul. It's foreigner friendly but with a solid locals vibe. It's great whether you're alone or eating in company and with a simple menu (with English!), it's easy to order. Definitely recommend!"
30,Tasted like a very regular bowl of noodles. Not too sure why was it so popular within the folks. Would not recommend a trip here.
40,"The fastest non-fast-food restaurant you will ever eat at. Only serves their staple items, dumplings and noodles. Once your order is in, the food comes out within a couple minutes and the price was really reasonable. Enjoyed the dumplings and cut noodles."
50,"With the help of a more detailed map of Myeongdong that we got at our Hotel Reception, it was easy to locate the eatery. Thankfully, no queue outside. We ordered a plate of dumplings and a bowl of noodles. The kimchi was very good compared with the ones we ate everywhere else. The dumplings were generous in their fillings and had a truly homemade feel. The skin was so delicate and yet did not break easily. However, it was the noodles and the broth that blew me away. Very tasty. The ground pork and few small dumplings were nice additions. Noodles texture was smooth and slightly chewy. Perfect!"
50,"A big bowl noodle, so soft and delicious with tasty broth. Portion is quite big. I order 2 bowl for 3 person. Dumpling also quite good. Price is really reasonable. Only KRW 8,000 for big bowl of noodle soup."
40,"What else can I say.. Korean BBQ, yuuummyyy!!! Good service as well...Iwould definitely visit this place again."
50,"Once you tried this noodle soup, you will be amazed of flavor of the soup! and dumpling I order with this noodle soup made my tougue in heaven! I love this soup and it's so sad that I cannot find any similar taste of this soup in Singapore! This is the best korean food for me! Try!!!!"
30,"Overall, the meal was not too bad. Service was good as well, even though the place was crowded in the lunch peak period. However, I think this place is overrated (this is just my personal opinion, you can still go ahead and try it if you want to).  My 3 friends and I came to a conclusion that we only enjoyed eating the kalguksu & dumplings. The cold soybean noodles has this weird aftertaste, therefore my friends and I couldn't finish it despite sharing; the bibimguksu was too spicy for me (i dont take spice very well)."
40,Don't miss out. Great soup! They serve only a few dishes (most of them traditional Korean). The noodle soup was amazing and the dumplings not bad. Food very affordable (enormous bowl of soup 7 euros and a big portion of big dumplings 8-9 euros). Salad refilled for free. It was a bit busy and people waited in front between 6-7 pm while I was there today. Worth it! Really tasty. And fast - got my dish within 5 minutes!
40,"Location quite easy to find, fast service. Ordered the dumpling and famous noodle. The dumpling is quite big, and the noodle taste good. One thing is, we were getting ready to eat, the service guy came to collect money, after we fumbled for the right notes and settled the payment, our food is a bit cold by then."
40,"Traditional Korean restaurant, with what seemed like only a half dozen dishes (with pictures) on the menu. You order, you pay, and then they deliver your dishes in just a few minutes. The dishes are very good. The green noodles in what seemed like a yogurt sauce (not sure) were very unusual. The place is crowded and noisy, but acceptable. If you are looking for a quiet, upscale Korean restaurant, this is not it. But if you are looking for authentic food in a more local environment, this could hit the spot."
50,It's cheap and the taste is fantastic. the soup for the noodle and kimchi they serve with it are just a wonderful combination! it's located in the central Myeongdong so it's very easy to find the place. One downside is that it's very crowded and chaotic. It's not a place to have a nice long talk!
40,"It's tasty but not so amazing. The service was really fast: as soon as we ordered, the dishes were already on our table. Price was ok, really affordable."
50,"Our first meal in Seoul. Right in the heart of the Myeongdong area, so just drop in for food and Carey on thereafter. Simple menu with 4-5 items so easy to order. Great value. Unless you are really hungry, the portions can be quite big for the small eaters. 10 dumplings in one basket."
40,"Limited items on the menu but it does save our time to wonder what to eat! Both the dumplings and handmade noodles are very nice, the food quality remains high for many years."
50,Love the dumplings and the minced pork noodles. The kimchi they serve is very strong in garlic smell. You need to chew a mint whole day to keep the smell away.
50,"No frills for sure, but you get a simple menu, quick pleasant service and good healthy tasty food. This is not a restaurant you linger in. Pay when you order and leave when you're done. Always packed with locals including dating teens/20s and young children... a sure sign it's good. Location very central so perfect for weary shoppers."
40,"Had been visited to this between 5 days.There is no much choices in this restaurant. Only 3 type of noodle with one dumpling. The size of korean dumpling was like our siew mai. But it was suggested to eat with onion garlic soy sauce which provided. Whoever like onion garlic sauce certainly cant stop eating! The noodle soup was not bad, is good when taking just after morning wake up! Will recommend to my friends surely :)"
40,Only four things on the menu. Dumplings are great and go well with the Kim chi. They will keep topping up your Kim chi too. The spicy noodles were good but were a cold dish which I didn't realise and wasn't my thing but I enjoyed. Cheap dinner and very fast. I had finished within ten mins of arriving! (I was on my own) Doesn't sell alcohol btw
40,"Probably I am Chinese, so I do not feel any wow factor. We ordered dumplings and noodles for sharing for 2 (lucky us, the portions are huge). Service is fast. Simple menu. My friend and I really like the sauce."
40,"It's a place where you have to wait on line for 10~30 minutes to be seated in the restaurant. Crowded with locals and tourists all the time. It sells Kal gook soo (noodle, possibly with chicken broth base) and dumplings. Both are very good and served with a bowl of rice and kimchi. Kimchi there is garlicky and spicy even for some locals. If you are hungry, you can ask for extra noodles for free. Serving is not friendly, but you will get what you ask for within two or three requests."
20,"I am a fan of dumpling, but I rather fancy Chinese style more. The Korean style (not just this restaurant) are putting too much meat, which was too over."
50,"Nice staffs, even if they don't speak English. They served so fast and the food was awesome!!! Super recommend for the dumpling and also the noodle soup. There were 3 of us and we ordered 2 noodles and one serving of dumpling and that was more than enough. Avoid the peak hour since this is tooooo popular! :)"
50,"good service, great Korean dumplings! Nice kimchi too, goes very well with the dumplings. definitely worth to give it a try!"
40,Followed by the reviews on tripadvisor and it didn't disappoint me. They only have 4 dishes on the menu. Within some minutes the dished were served. That's really really fast. Overall the taste is good but nothing spectacular. Good price and taste. Worth a visit.
40,"We ordered Mandu (dumplings) and Kalguksu (knife-cut noodles) for two to share. The quality of the food is unquestionable, but we felt that the price could be cheaper. We loved their homemade sauce, which went with both the dumplings and noodles."
50,"Myeongdong Kyoja is located amidst the Beauty Shops so it is easy to miss it. One landmark at the moment is to keep a lookout for the Big ArtBox shop nearby. We had to ask a street vendor in order to find this place.  The restaurant itself is on the second floor. The whole place was packed with both locals and foreigners.  We tried the steamed dumplings and the Noodle soup. The skin of the dumpling was nicely thin and the filling was flavourful and yummy.  As for the Noodle soup, it was super tasty (not the msg sort of tasty). The noodle comes with small dumplings that look like wantons as well as some minced pork.  The taste of the dumplings and noodles kept me wanting for more during the rest of my trip.  It is worth a trip to this restaurant to try out what they have to offer. I am glad it was on my list of things to do while in Seoul.  One bonus: the staff there was friendly and made us feel comfortable although they have a limited command of English. Ordering is easy... one can just point at the pictures by the wall.  Think of it as nice comfort food :)"
30,"This restaurant is getting to an instant restaurants The main menu, Kalguksu is not chewiness Just a bunch of garlic, Kimchi is uncomfortable to eat"
40,"Food is great but nothing to shout about. Will definitely go back if I am nearby. Service is really fast, took them less than 10 minutes to serve us the dumpling and soup noodle."
30,"A Korean friend recommended this place (I didn't even know it was rated so highly on TA) so I decided to try it out. There are only three or four dishes on the menu, the signature being their dumplings. I knew these were filled with meat, so I ordered the cold green spicy noodles as I checked in my limited grasp of Korean that there was no meat and they said yes. When the dish arrived it looked wonderful. I took one bite and while the noodles were a fantastic silky texture and beautifully spicy, there was minced pork throughout the dish. Sadly I could not eat it so the whole bowl went to waste which pained me. The kimchi they serve is super spicy, even for me and I LOVE spicy food, and the soup they serve also contained minced pork, so I ended up paying around KRW8k but couldn't eat anything. Gutted."
50,We tried a little bit of everything and it was all uniquely delicious. The dumplings were my favorite! Definitely worth checking out. They are famous for their dumplings for a good reason!
40,"We were told that the queue would be quite long, We were quite surprise that the service were very fast and efficient. And so we do not need to wait for long. The noodle is delicious and dumplings are very tasty. The portion is quite big for us but may be not so for korean/ european people. The price is also quite reasonable. I would really recommend this dish for a change."
40,"There was a queue of about 10 people in front of our group of 4 , but we were seated within 20 minutes. A no nonsense menu with limited choice but we ordered everything and tired it.  The famous dumplings were far too meaty for me, but the vinegar ginger sauce cut the heaviness of the meat very well. i enjoyed the hand cut noodle soup kalgusuk but couldn't appreciate the noodles which came with a white soybean soup"
40,Myeongdong Kyoja is like a restaurant in Myeongdong you have to visit at least once!  I would say it's a little bit overrated but it was a good experience to try the food. The dumpling stuffing was really crazily filling. The noodles was quite authentic and nice.  The menu do not have many choices but the price was quite affordable to at least try once!  I don't regret visiting the restaurants because I get to try the food and I actually love the dumpling a lot.
50,"Definitely worth the search in busy Myeong dong. Extremely satisfying meal! Unique noodle and broth, nice dumpling! I'm a kimchi lover and the luvvvvv the spicier version here !!"
30,"A unique casual noodle place. I like both dumpling noodle soup or spicy cold green noodle. Very busy place, hard to expect a good guest service but free flow of Kimchi and steam rice ... Love it's kimchi !!! Look forward to go there again during my next trip to seoul"
30,"Was expecting a very wonderful dinner after reading all the review. However, the food taste just above average, not fantastic kind. Price is reasonable. However, if there is a queue , then can forget it."
40,Comfort food. Yummy dumplings. Loved the noodles. Simple and tasty. Will go back and eat it again when I go back to Seoul.
30,"It is so famous that foreigners come, Korean also gathered here for social or dinner gathering. The menu is simple, food is good, we ordered the kyoja and spicy cold noodles, whereas the complimentary kimchi is too salty for me. You have to pay immediately after you ordered and before food arrive. Slightly disappointed as the waiter is not so friendly."
50,I've been here numerous times. Love this place for lunch. The noodle soup broth is tasty and dough texture is smooth and chewy. Worth the trip. Staff service is also excellent! They also offer rice as part of their service. Will return again!
50,One of the best traditional Korean way of dumplings and noodles in Seoul. You will have to expect to see a long waiting line in a hot summer and cold winter. But it is worth waiting for 10 minutes.
30,"This is one of those specialised restaurants that only has like 4 things on their menu - steamed dumplings, 1 hot soup noodles, 1 cold soup noodles and 1 cold sauce noodles. There were 4 of us so we tried everything. The hot soup noodles were extremely average, soup had nothing memorable at all and noodles were a bit too soft. The cold sauce noodles were okay but gets a bit overpowering with the sour chilli sauce after awhile. The cold soup noodles were in a white thick paste (not sure what exactly it is) but were completely bland and I felt like I was eating unseasoned noodles in some weird grainy paste. The only saving grace were the dumplings, packed full of juicy meat and thin skin. I wouldn't make the effort to go back but if I did I would only get dumplings."
40,"A bit localize dumpling restaurant, but you must try both dumpling and soup noodles, they are yummy! Their kimchi also tasty as well if you like it. Must go again for my next Korea trip."
40,"Make sure you check the pictures on TripAdvisor from the entrance. Without them you wont find it. They basically have 6 dishes on the menue but all of them are amazingly well done. Full of locals. Nice interior, felt original. Food was on the table within minutes! Make sure to try the dumplings. They are the best i had ever."
30,"Tried the dumplings and the hot noodles - noodles were pretty good but the soup was very garlicky. I didn't feel like the dumplings were anything special either - just standard pork dumplings, and if anything, a little bland and dry."
40,"Ate here twice when i went to Seoul, two years apart. Lines here are usually long but the queue is quick. You might also miss looking for the place since the entrance is small but you can usually see people lining up outside.  They only have 4 items on the menu. I really recommend the dumplings and the noodles. The noodle broth was nice, flavourful and a bit thick. The dumplings were meaty, plump and juicy. Their kimchi is also very nice, very cold and very spicy.  Definitely a must eat for me when I am in Seoul. Looking forward to my next trip here."
30,"Read much online regarding this restaurant hence we went to eat there. When we were there, it was half full of people and staff was OK. We ordered their famous dumpling (one featured) and 1 noodle. They only have like 3 - 4 dishes. Noodle was good as it was chewy but the dumpling was average. Too much garlic for me. It was one of those places whereby you try it once and that's about it."
50,"Only 4 dishes in the menu and we tried 3 of them. Loved the dumplings and the dry noodles! Service is really quick but expect a crowd during dinner time. BTW, the dumplings still taste just as good when you takeaway."
40,"Always full house. Recommended to try all food It only few itemin menu,soya mee ，mee soup,and 饺子。 The chili super nice.must try it Nice food friendly staff"
40,"There was a queue when we entered the restaurant but it moved really fast. The service was fast since there are only 4 items in the menu. Dumplings were really nice and juicy. It is really value for money. The cold noodles were not too bad but I like it with less sauce as it tasted quite salty. I would prefer a lighter version. The kimchi was flavourful and spicy. The hot noodle soup was quite a big portion and although my children are big eaters, they could not finish it. I do find the soup noodles over-rated. It was nice but not really fantastic. The noodles were a soggy after a while because we took so long to eat it. Did not try the soy bean milk noodles, seems weird to have noodles in my soya bean drink....."
50,"Good noodles, best dumplings.  The dumplings are somewhat different from the typical Chinese type of dumplings, and is abit more savoury. A must try, really! Really delicious, and comes with great sauces for dipping.  Their noodles have a nice soup, and there is always plenty of space, with 3 levels of seats."
50,"Only 3-4 things on the menu, i ate alone and order the pork noodles with wontons which was absolutely delicious. The dumplings look good too but unfortunately I didn't have it. I think their kimchi was one of the best I had on my 2 week trip in Korea though. 8000 won was very reasonable price-wise, you have to pay right after you order. Will definitely go back!"
30,"The dumplings were ok, and the hot noodles were kinda bad. The noodles were so soft and soggy. Service was poor and the waiters were very rude. They make you finish your food quickly and they asked us to leave the restaurant once we are done."
50,"These guys only make four things, and they crush at least three of them! The dumplings were absolutely delicious-juicy and flavorful. The chopped noodle soup had great flavor. The spicy noodles / contrary to the color were only mildly spicy (which was great) and they had great pepper flavor. Would highly recommend."
40,They serve wonderful dumplings and noodles dishes. I had a bowl of cold noodle which was very delicious. They have two outlets in Myeongdong. I visited just before lunchtime so I didn't have to wait long.
50,My sisters and I ordered the kalguksu and dumpling. They taste really delicious. We even came here twice during our trip in Seoul.
50,"Great place to eat in between your shopping trip in Myeong-dong. The Gyoza and the Kalguksu really taste great, although the kimchi is a little bit too strong for my liking."
50,The dumplings are great but the noodles are Super as well. Tried the minced meat noodle and the big bean soup noddle. It's amazing and the noddles should be given more focus instead of just the dumplings. Must try!
40,"There are only 4 items on the menu. Dumplings ( only one kind) and 3 types of noodles. Hand made cut noodles with minced pork in soup, ( soup is too bland ) Soy bean milk noodles and spicy looking dry noodles ( u can order this cold or hot) U also pay when your food arrives. Kimchi is replenished as much as u want from the bucket. It's a tad too salty ( in my personal opinion ) and may be too spicy for others."
50,"If you see the line, do not be discouraged. It moves super fast. Does not matter if you chose 1st or 2nd floor. Express Service. Great Food."
50,Nothing fancy but you go here for the food. Only 4 items on the menu and the place is always packed but not heaving. There are others like this but this sets the benchmark. Two can eat for under $20. Yumbo!
50,Simple menu with just a few items. I will make sure I visit this place whenever I am in Seoul. Have always been wanting to try the bibim guksu but ended up having kalguksu as it was either raining or winter whenever I visit. Love the kalguksu and the dumpling. The kimchi is the best i ever had so far as the garlic taste is very strong and the standard has always been consistent over these 4-5 years. The portion is huge though so two adults can share a bowl of kalguksu if you are not that hungry.
40,"With a party of six (four adults and two children), we were able to order everything on the menu! The three noodle dishes are actually reasonably large so two not-so-hungry adults will only need to order one bowl in addition to the must-order pork dumplings. For the six of us however, we had one bowl of each noodle plus two servings of the dumplings which proved to be just nice. Kimchi is free flow, and quite nice to my taste as it was more garlicky. Service is fast, attentive and a bit on the brusque side, but that's not why you're here!  Total cost was W44,000 which is not going to break the bank, but on the pricier side of what I'd consider to be quality fast food."
40,Should try the dumplings. Taste is good and easy to order as their menu only have 4 dishes. Location is easy to find. Couldn't finish the noodle probably because I am a small eater. Price are reasonable.
50,"Ordering is easy. If you are dining in, there are only four items on the menu, three of which are noodles. The other is a minced pork dump,using that could pass for gyoza. You pay as you order, open the drawer on the table to extract your chopsticks and spoon, pour yourself some cold water, and before you know it, the dumplings are there. Next came thesoup, piping hot, with a side of kimchi. Man, both were good!"
50,"We visited this noodle shop in December 2014 on a recommendation from a random tourist brochure. This doesn't always bode well, but in this case it worked out great. The place was busy, mostly with Koreans rather than overseas tourists. It created a good buzz and busy atmosphere.  They have a very limited menu, but what they do serve is excellent. We ordered one soup noodle bowl each as well as a tray of dumplings to share. The dumplings were flavoured well, but overall tasted average to slightly above average. The noodle soup, however, was excellent. The noodles had a good texture and chew, and the flavours of the soup and ingredients were fantastic. The flavours were all complementary and was one of the better meals we ate in Seoul.  The prices were not cheap but remained quite reasonable. It didn't feel overpriced, despite the shop's apparent fame. It was a very enjoyable lunch."
50,There are 2 restaurant both in the same street. Only 4 dishes are offered and the noodle soup and dumplings are both worth going for. Unlimited Kim chi is also available and all at a good cheap price. You sit at shared tables and service is very quick
30,"I went here because of the reviews on trip advisor the food is good but the service was rude. This was the only time in South Korea when I got annoyed with the service. You are sat down and a lady stands over you while you choose your food granted the menu has 4 items but then she demands payment immediately, it put my partner and I in a bad mood and we couldn't wait to leave also I noticed the they only gave kimchi refills to locals and not us even though we had eaten all of our kimchi overall not very welcoming there are plenty of other places to go that are better!"
40,My local friends told me this is a famous place for authentic Korean noodle. There are only 4 dishes available on the menu and for this reason the service was extremely efficient. My favourite is the dumplings.
50,Fantastic dumplings!! The wrapper just thin enough to make it light but not fragile. The noodles taste fantastic as well! Must visit.
50,the best street food u can get is from myeong dong apart from variety of shopping! m sure any foodie would enjoy !
40,I picked this place on location and recommendations and it was worth it. The dishes are just a few to select from but a sure choice. It all is delicious and very affordable. Unfortunately no beer to accompany them :-)
40,"Meal is good, portion is good, taste is good, service also good, restaurant location is good. gyoza really delicious"
40,"the place is almost always crowded but not necessarily form a queue. the food itself is good but watch out, the portion is super big! so I suggest you to share."
40,"We were just off the flight and starving. After checking into our hotel, we headed out and found ourselves at the door step of the famous Myeongdong Kyoja. Tummies rumbling, we ordered a bowl of noodles each and a basket of dumplings to share. Dumplings were tasty but lacked the soup inside the dumpling skin like we are accustomed to. Other than that, we filled our bellies and were ready to hit the streets!"
50,"This is quite easy to find in Myeongdong and a 5 minute walk from the hotel we stayed in, Loisir. Tucked away in an alley, this gem did have the yummiest noodles and dumplings. Not knowing the food proportions, we ordered a bowl of noodles for each of us and an order of dumplings... way too much food for just the two of us, and looking around, parties of two shared a bowl of noodles and dumplings... little did we know. Place was very busy but tables turned over pretty quickly and service was good and quick."
40,"Baby friendly restaurant - they simply told customers queueing before us that we have baby with us, and led us to a table first. Don't think they were unhappy because their customers turnover rate is very high. Good food. Great service."
30,"I didn't find anything spectacular about the place, is crowded yes, but I don't understand the high rating on trip advisor: 3 types of dishes, either noodles or dumplings and the ubiquitous kimchi. You have to sit, pay,eat and leave. Not a place to stay and enjoy the meal."
40,"Followed a group of foodie to this place! Not a fan of gyoza/kyoja but was bowled over by the quality of the food and nice laid back environment! The company probably made the difference, we took up almost a third of the restaurant. Unassuming and authentic Korean experience!"
30,"This restaurant is largely frequented by Koreans, as it is well known for serving traditional food.  Dishes were tasty, but the restaurant is certainly not a place one would want to stay for long. Just sit down, eat and leave.  The only two words spoken to me by the waitress were 'pay now'."
50,"had this two days straight.. too tasty!!  affordable pricing with generous serving.. restaurant can get crowded at times but there's always either available seating or short waiting time.  Try the soup noodles - noodles are smooth and smooth together with tasty soup.. Have to try the dumplings too! Generous meat fillings and all the meals comes with free flow portion of kimchi (btw, the kimchi taste good..) which the staff will top up periodically once your portion runs out."
30,"After living in Korea for 8 years, I visited Myeongdong Gyoja for the first time today. I was always turned off by the long lines waiting to eat there. I had to wait just a few minutes, which was nice. Be prepared for long waits, especially between 12-1 PM, which is when most of the workers in the area have their lunch break. We were hurriedly ushered in my an attendant at the door and seated. The menu is pretty straight forward with only a few items, so ordering doesn't take too long. I think they must make it in mass quantities in anticipation of the big lunch crowds. I wasn't overly impressed with the soup. I found the noodles to be way overcooked, but the kimchi was a standout for me. I like crisp, garlicky, spicy kimchi, so theirs hit the spot. Servers are kind of short and too the point and not overly friendly or warm. Although, I don't really blame them with the high volume of business they get probably non-stop. While I wasn't totally disgusted with the food, I prefer ""Myeongdong kalguksu"" much more. Overall, I'm glad I finally went to say I tried it."
40,"When you go in you are hurried to a table, and they get your order to your table super fast. The service is, in Korean style, a little brusque but the food it so delicious, and well priced, that it more than makes up for it. Very popular with Chinese visitors, as far as I could tell, but you don't often have to wait for long."
40,"A must visit! I go there every time I visit Seoul. And in the winter, the scrumptious hot soup is greatly appreciated."
40,"This restaurant is super famous among locals. When my friends heard that I was staying in Myeongdong the first thing they told me was to try this restaurant. I ate their by myself but they have perfect accommodations for solo eaters. It was the most flavorful Kalguksu that I have ever eaten. I wish I had been hungrier because the portion was so large, I wasn't able to finish my bowl. Meal was under $10 usd. Go and try it if you're in Myeongdong!"
40,"This place have a few dishes. Two noodles dish, and a dumpling basket. Overall, I enjoy the noodles which have a delicious porky flavor broth which taste similar to a traditions Chinese noodle. And the dumplings are serve steaming hot. It's pretty simple. Fyi, don't be shock but you'll paid first."
40,"Very simple. They only had 4 four dishes and it was very easy to order because of the pictures. My son is a picky eater, and we had to resort to McDonald's for a couple of days because we didn't know where to eat. When we found out about Myeongdong Kyoja during our visit, we ate there twice. He LOVED the dumplings. He really ate a lot. Loved the beef soup as well. Kimchi was unlimited. So was the rice. It was just jam packed during lunch though so come there early if you want to get good seats right away. They also give you free Xylitol for moth freshener after each meal. :)"
50,"Just four dishes, large photos of each on the walls. You pay first and get your food quick. Dishes, particularly the dumplings, are delicious. It close earlier (9 pm) that other restaurants in the area, so do not leave it till the end. Highly recommended"
40,"Very generous serving of the kyoja but looks more like xiao long bao to me. Apparently, they have few outlets but we went to the main shop for our breakfast! Hehe"
50,No frills restaurant that serves just dumplings and noodles in thick broth. This place is much busier on a cold day!
50,"We love both Gyoja and Kalgooksu! Gyoja is dumpling so if you are familiar with dumplings in your own country, then it could be so so. But this is still good. Kalgooksu - beef soup noodle - is the real thing here and it still tastes good even a while after this restaurant became super touristic starting from Japanese now to the world. They only have 4 menus. When you find any restaurant coming with a few menu selections, they are the real ones."
