50,"If you have the opportunity to have an Isacc toast a day, have 10+ days. This would be my only advice. Since visiting Seoul last year, the double cheese potato was my go-to for the duration of my trip, along with the delicious and refreshing ice tea. Im still craving this heaven-sent treat, so much that I regret having it in the first place. If I were to have seen all the beautiful cultural and historic attractions of S. Korea, I would still return for the Isaac Toast. My request would be a vegan option and a franchise in London, please.",
50,"The toast is prepared freshly after your order and the special sweet sauce greatly enhanced the taste of the buttery toast, making it so delicious. The queue can get quite long at this outlet so be prepared to wait, or else there are several branches around seoul which you can try as well.",
50,"Located footsteps from my hotel, isaac toast very tasty. I really love the toast with extra cheese. Don?ôt forget to try their coffee. Perfect combination for breakfast on winter season.",
50,i tried hot chicken MPV. The sauce is yummy and comes along with the some vegetables. This make the sandwich very delicious. i also ordered hot coffee. This is prefect match in winter.,
40,Would love to try again. I did not manage to get the one from Myeondong due to the long queue of tourist and somehow I got this from Pochoen bus terminal. A very quiet place. Ahjumma made my Best Bacon toast so good that I wanted to order more if not because of the bus timing,
40,"We went early but there was already a short queue there. The queue was quite fast and organised though. As this is a take-away kiosk, there are no seats available. We walked around a little looking for a place to sit down to eat, and it was not hot by the time we ate them. But they were still warm and tasty!",
40,"We tried the Ham & Cheese, Bulgogi, Bacon & Cheese bagel, as well as the Double Cheese Pork Cutlet. All are yummy. The best I find is Ham & Cheese!",
50,"Sandwich is excellent. It's a bit different than my typical sandwich as this one is on the sweeter side, but I think the sauce works and it tasted good. I like tteokgalbi & ham and cheese. Do be aware that the line can get quite long, especially around lunch time. It's worth it in my opinion.",
50,I was in Seoul for 8 days (7 mornings). There is a Isaac Toast within 5mins' walk from my hotel. I walked there for 5 mornings to pack yummy egg sandwiches back for my family ?òã,
50,We had the ham & cheese sandwich here a couple times during our stay in Seoul. The food was great and it was just a short walk from the hotel. Get there early as the line got long at peak times.,
40,Decided to get some supper after a light dinner and the ham and cheese toast did not disappoint! The bread was light and slightly sweet but all so yummy! Two thumbs up!,
40,"Isaac Toast was a trend, but probably came down over the year. The toasts are still ok considering that they are freshly made.  This is the one we visited few times so far walking from Myeongdong towards Dongdaemun. This one is a food counter so there's no table seating.  There are more outlets nearby (within 1km radius maybe?), but this seems to still maintain a relatively long queue compared to others, maybe due to its location facing the main street.  We didn't order coffee from this juncture. There's a better coffee place just few steps down the road.",
40,"Queued for about half an hour for breakfast, it was pretty good.  Tip: We found another outlet right across the road in a smaller lane with a much shorter queue and larger menu. Would recommend that if you don't have time to queue. Staff were more friendly too. Don't think it's listed on TripAdvisor but i've attached a googlemap screenshot. There's a lane that splits off after the myeongdong station underpass exit, head to the left lane with the coffeeshop ""A Twosome Place"" and it should be just a few metres walk down that path.",
40,"There was a long queue at this outlet in the morning. So I decided to return later in the afternoon and there was no queue at all. I tried the ham sandwich - tasty and reasonably priced at 2,900 won.",
40,"My flight arrived in Incheon super early in the morning, so I had a short wait before I could check in to my hotel. Decided to pass the time by having breakfast at Issacs. I had the Best Bacon sandwich. It was tasty but I did t care for the mayonnaise on it. It was great for walking around and exploring the shops that opened early in Myeongdong.",
10,"I don't care what anybody says, this is not great toast. Not even good toast, actually. Please do not bother coming here when you're from a country where they serve actual toast and sandwiches.  Why? Because the toast in covered in something sugarry, my guess is corn syrup. So you have very sweet bread, with some toppings and a lot of cole. Did not like it one bit.",
50,Good for snack and something quick or you can take out and walk around with it !!! Good for cold day !!,
40,"This is a budget breakfast on the go. Located outside the Days Hotel Myeong-dong. Start at 7am and the Q will peak around 8am onwards. It can have a long queue of 20 people or more.  Is it worth the wait? If not, there is always another similar outlet around the corner, near the Embassy of China, named ?úHobong Toast??",
30,"When I reached Isaac Toast I saw a queue of about 20 people ahead of me. After hearing much about this, I decided to join the line. It took about 20 minutes to reach my turn and I was hoping for a new taste experience. The toast was tasty but quite oily. I have ate better toast than this and overall not worth my wait of about 20 minutes.",
50,"Best bulgogi sandwich, we must say! The long line is definitely worth it. A must try! We recommend to try them during non-peak hours. We saw the very long line around 8-9am. We came back around 4pm and the line is tolerable. We were finally able to try it!",
30,"Came here at 10am and had to wait 40mins. 1 Ahjumma at least speaks Mandarin and they will take your order swiftly. No nonsense no frills, and they claim there is no photo taking allowed. Choice of sanwiches and either coffee or tea. This outlet has no seats and is purely take away.",
40,"We went to the shop real early to have the toasts for breakfast before starting on our day trip. We were super early so there was no queue at all. Hahas.. tasts were freshly made like Japanese Tepan style right in front of you and you can enjoy the aroma while waiting for your order. The shop is rather cosy with the plastic curtains to help shield the winter breeze.  A simple toast sets with a warm beverage is about 4,000krw. Mine was 4,000 and my boyfriend's was 4,500krw.  The taste of the toast was kinda sweet to chew while the toasts were crusty to bits - not a far cry from the crusty toasts at Yakun. The blend between the different ingredients were good too - no alien tastes. Hahas.. we love it and would have it again if time allows.",
40,"Queued for 40mins from Thursday 9am! Ordered Bulgoggi Toast and Ham and Cheese Toast. Bulgoggi Toast is a tad sweet. Otherwise both Toast are rather tasty. Won?ôt mind going back as price is reasonable by Korean standards, but may not want to queue for so long!",
40,"Tried Isaac Toast for the first time in December 2018 and ended up going back Everyday. If you are in Myeongdong do note there is another branch / store that is within Myeongdong, apart from the store facing the main road that is always packed. The toast generally comes sweet no matter which flavour you pick, but I would stick to the ham or bacon combination. Need to highlight the smooth vanilla latte as well as the refreshing banana strawberry smoothie that are notable mentions to pair with your toast.",
50,"Best breakfast if you staying at Myeongdong. Queue very long but worth it. If you reach at 8am, then not much queue. Nice hot breakfast for winter ?•∂",
50,"I bought for my children, waiting time around 10 mins (no queue at that moment( and they commented is awesome ...",
30,"Nice combo of the sandwiches, but not spectacular. A bit overrated. But if you are looking for a quick bite, western style. Then ok",
40,"After read about the recommendation, decided to check it out since it located near the hotel I stayed in Myeongdong area. Very easy to find, along tge main road and saw the queue from far. The queue moved fast, I got my toast less than 15mins. The meat is juicy, the bread is soft. Is a little of sweet taste, I believe is the jam. Some salad and melted chese in between. Overall, I love it and enjoy the toast. Most importantly, the price is affordable.",
50,This place is as advertised. They have breakfast sandwiches on toast. It?ôs basically a grilled sandwich with a Korean twist. The slaw is nice. There?ôs a sweet sugary sauce they put on it that I could take or leave but all in all I wanted a second and third sandwich. I plan to go back to try other sandwiches but I had the Bacon Best and it was great.,
50,"This is really amazing, even though It doesn't look fancy. I used to eat this toast almost twice a week after school with my friends. The price is cheap and there are many different kinds of toasts. Especially, the special yellowish sauce is awesome, and this sauce is ""Isaac Toast"" company's heart. Thus, I highly recommend you to visit Isaac Toast and have any toast you want to try! Oh! and plan for traveling South Korea to try this beautiful toast:) I am sure that this toast would make your trip more memorable and enjoyable.",
50,"It?ôs always a very long queue whenever we pass by the place so we decided to buy also. We ordered the bacon best and the ham special and it really taste good! I would definitely recommend Isaac to my friends, my colleagues and my family to taste it when they visit Myeongdong.",
30,It's ok breakfast and you get different sandwiches and the bread are white. And the testing is totally normal. But fast eating and to go.,
50,"I love Isaac toast, the cafe is everywhere, a small cafe for a takeout meal. but I don't understand why it is so popular only in myeongdong. the taste also similar to other Isaac cafe, just in case you hate to queue just grab the toast at another Isaac branch. but i love the shrimp toast anyway.",
40,Had the ham and egg and cheese twice. Inexpensive. The bread has corn in it so it?ôs sweet and adds to the flavor of the sandwich. Less than $3US for a sandwich that is quite filling,
20,"With the influx of tourists, the queue was long and the wait was terrible. Food was disappointing compared a few years back. I guess they got too complacent. Would recommend trying other outlets, this was just bad.",
10,"Had a ham and cheese toast. Lousy bread, cheap margarine, lousy cheese, processed ham. Not sure what the fuss is about. Paris baguette is much better, any day, any time.",
50,"There's always a long line in ISAAC even early in the morning, but I guess it's worth it. I love their sandwich. I forgot what I ordered, but I can still remember the taste and now I'm craving for it. Come here if you are not that hungry yet because I'm sure you will once you get your order haha And oh... there are no seat so yeah...",
40,"First time was in Dec 2017, it was really nice and hot to eat during the freeing cold weather. Went to buy it this morning and it was raining. I bought bacon for myself and ham and cheese for my kids, all finished and said nice. 3 toasts cost about 7.8k won.",
30,"We were there a few times and the first day with lots of people queuing up and we decided to find some other food. Finally on the third day we were there around 5pm and no need to wait. We tried the classic ham and cheese toast, hot, crispy bread with the special spread for Isaac Toast. The food is not as impressive with the high hopes or word of mouth, found it rather sweet with the special spread. So not as good as expected.",
30,"So much hype about this sandwich and we went to get it for breakfast in one of the morning when we were in Seoul. It was raining that morning we were there and there was a queue too. Waited about 20mins to get our sandwich, was nice but not fantastic",
40,"Backdated post to May 2017.  The twist to normal sandwiches. They had bulgogi and some others which was worth the try. Its not spectacular but its simple, good and fuss free. We could always have it on the go.  I hope the franchise in Spore will be as good as the ones in Seoul. :)",
30,"It is very popular. The bread I got wasn't even toasted, just warmed; but the sandwich fillings were tasty. The paper covering contained a bible quotation which said something about how god made Isaac rich. Nice to know while eating a cheap sandwich..  It was a long-ish walk from my hotel, which didn't have good options for breakfast. I probably won't do it again, but it's worth trying once.",
30,The sandwiches are good but not good enough to wait in the long line. There are many good places to eat so you really don't need to wait in long lines anywhere. It's a waste of time to wait in line to eat unless you have nothing better to do.,
40,"Very filling compare to mcDonald big breakfast set. It is warm, tasty and lot of variety. Now I finally understand why so long queue every day I passed by. At the other hand, the price for beverage is very close to the price for one sandwich which I personally think not worth it. (this is why I take out 1 star from this review) If you want a simple breakfast and your hotel?ôs breakfast suck, this is something you can try.",
40,You need to be prepared for long lines sometimes with no where to wait or sit and eat indoors. The sandwiches are tasty although with copious amounts of butter and mayo make this a less than healthy choice. Once in a while is enough for me.,
40,I like the ham and chesse sandwich. It doesn't look big but it is definitely filling for me. The queue for breakfast is really long so be prepared to wait. Will definitely eat again.,
40,"Recommended place for breakfast if you want a simple, wholesome meal. They have a variety of choices, bacon sandwich, shrimp or potato. The prices are reasonable. As for the drinks, we ordered a green tea latte which is rather disappointing because it tasted a bit diluted. Overall, it is quite a nice experience.",
50,Convenietly located at the back of our hotel. I?ôve been eating breakfast buffet at the hotel for 3 days now and I just wanted to eat something different and happened to find this place. This place is quick and cheap but the taste is good. Good for people who are on the go. Good place for breakfast sandwiches and hot and cold drinks. They have bagel and biscuit bread selections also. And their prices won?ôt hurt your budget.,
50,My hub and I have been wanting to try out the toast for a long time. Finally we came here at around 10am. There was a queue but it moved pretty quickly. I got myself a chicken toast whereas my hub had a bulgogi vip toast. Super delicious! The toast was buttery and thick. The cheese and patty were hot and they came together so well. Worth coming back.,
50,Tuck in at a lane within the shopping streets of Myeungdong. Isaac toast is delicious. The bread is well toasted and nicely done for the ?útoast aroma?? They have a few options on their menu from cheese/ham to toast with patty. It?ôs worth the wait!,
50,Super delicious sandwiches! Hearty meal not only for breakfast but at all times. Que was long in the morning but its always worth the wait!,
10,Lots of mystery meats and cheap processed cheeses here. The sandwiches are edible if you're in a hurry and get them to not put on the bizarre sweet sauce that wouldn't be out of place on an ice cream sundae. Just get real Korean food and avoid this google image search style attempt to make a western sandwich.,
40,"This is a super busy location for what they call toast. It's essentially a grilled cheese with an egg and meat in it. They grill it directly in front of you.  The lineup was a bit long, but they work fast, so it's not an issue.  No issues ordering as their English is great. And they show the amount on a calculator.  They serve it in a waxed paper pocket, as it is a bit greasy from the butter.  But it is very good. The sauce is a bit different, sweet, but very good.  Excellent for a quick bite",
50,"Well worth the wait in line. The sandwich aka toast is delicious. There are several kinds to chose from and they make them right in front of you. The chicken one was very tasty.  The staff also speak good English and offer great service. The location is perfect, right near the market and the train.",
50,"When I was told that I must try Isaac Toast, my reaction was whats so special with a grilled cheese and ham sandwich? Mind you i don't eat ham - then I accidentally passed one of the Isaac kiosks and surprisingly there were no queues. So i thought to myself, why the heck not.  Apparently, the secret isn't the generous buttering of the grill top, the secret is in a a sweat, seasoned glaze that is spread on the inside of the toast before its placed on the grill. IT tasted amazing and I wanted to come back for more. Also, the old ladies that were preparing the sandwiches were sweet hearts.  It was worth the hype after all.",
50,"A good variety of sandwiches which made us wanted to try a different sandwich the second time. Recommend the Bulgalbi MVP. Order your sandwiches first, pay for it, wait for your order number and finally grab your food!",
40,"We came back to this deli on our second trip to Seoul. The sandwich here is great - any one of them. Most of the choices are Korean specialty. We saw this deli in other locations but have only tried this location.  The line is long - it could be up to an hour, so prepare yourself for the wait time.",
50,We tried the bulgogi sandwich and it was delicious! Great for a quick bite and Korean style sandwich!,
50,"This place is an essential to visit while you are in Seoul for a heart warming cheap eat for lunch or dinner. There are a number of Isaac Toast outlets in Seoul so you should be able to find one quite easily. They have a number of different flavours including ham & cheese, bulgalbi MVP and my favourite the double cheese potato. Very cheap ranging from 2500-3500 won (¬£2-4) and you can take it away of eat it inside. Highly recommend it especially if you are recovering from the night before.",
40,"We?ôve been here twice in a day, I know it is over rated but this was delicious and definitely go ba for a visit",
30,i think Isaac toast is over-rated! Tried 2 of their toast but thinks its so so only... quite normal actually!,
50,There are hundreds of branches in the Seoul area but they say this branch in Myeongdong is the busiest. The line throughout the day is always long.  We stayed at Days Hotel Myeongdong so it was literally just outside the hotel's doors. Pretty convenient for us to buy this for breakfast instead of availing of the hotel's buffet.  It's cheap and very tasty. I especially loved the bagel sandwich.,
50,"This is my must go-to breakfast in Seoul. I dont know why but there is something magically about their toast. Maybe im biased. I had it on my first day in Seoul and i couldnt leave Seoul without having it on my last day as well.  the queue might look it is taking forever, but this is definitely worth waiting. I queued about 20mins.  Depending on the type you get, the toast is priced from 2,700won to 3,500 won.  I couldnt recommend a specific toast, because i love them all.  Because of their sheer volume of work and to reduce language confusion, i learn to just tell them the menu food number & quantity.  Example, ham cheese toast is stated as number five on the menu and i just want one of it, i'll tell them - ""number five, one"" and show one index finger to the auntie, to further indicate that i just want one.  However, if there is no number indicated on the menu, just pronounce the name of the toast slowly. They will get it.  (The toast might have a slight sweet taste to it)  They charged a nominal sum (10 won?) for a plastic bag if you wanna put your toast or many toasts in it together.",
40,It?ôs fast food that you wait about 20 minutes for. It is delicious (had the chicken toast) and a must-try if you?ôre in Seoul. Nothing fancy but they cook it right there and you get to watch.,
40,We tried the toast for breakfast. It was delicious and it was highly affordable. But the line was long so be mentally prepared,
40,"Came here for breakfast , we had the set which come with coffee or ice tea , I had the bacon , egg , cheese toast which was ok . We sat down outside the street where plastic chairs provided but not many . Price was 3500 won",
50,"We went there to grab breakfast on two mornings. There was a queue on both mornings but it was quite fast moving. We grabbed one toast each on our first visit. It was so good and tasty that few of us ordered two toasts on our second visit.  The toast were spread with a special sauce, which I think is what makes it take delicious and unique. I think the toast tasted especially good due to the extremely cold temperature in Seoul when we visited. It was so nice having a warm toast while walking in such cold weather.",
50,"I've heard a lot about this Isaac Toast and finally got to try it! It was amazing, tasted slightly sweet but good! Good snack for anytime and at a cheap price!",
30,"Apparently, eggs are standard in their sandwiches, so if you don?ôt want egg, you have to let them know. I ordered ham and cheese because I thought it would be ham and cheese. Because of the weird eggs I couldn?ôt enjoy it. For all you lovers of sweetened omelettes this is the place.",
40,"Just like any other toast, Isaac toast is a quick bite food for breakfast or snacking. We found Isaac Toast near Myeongdong Cathedral and tried its ham and cheese special toast. It tasted delicious. This branch opened at 07.30 a.m and closed at 22.30 p.m.",
50,I was recommended to try this joint in Seoul. I truly enjoyed the sandwich and the quality. Portion was generous and the sandwich is made fresh. Service was really good.,
40,"My best friend recommended Isaac toast to me, I think it worth a try. The sandwiches don't really look fancy but the taste is good and would be better than normal sandwich.",
30,"Koreans never ever wait to wat issac toast. It's just an place to have quick meal with reasonable price and quite a good taste. there are so many issac toast branches in korea and only the one in myeongdong has a waiting line.  So for the travellers, I would recommend to eat somewhere else in myeongdong and try the issac toast in other places in seoul where you do not have to wait for long",
50,"Highly recommended toast. Good variety of toast options and the ones I had have been very impressive. Seems to be pretty popular among the locals too. Cheap, good, served hot and filling. Well done. No sitting area though. It?ôs all pack and go.",
20,"We recently tried Issac Toast in Myeongdong after reading much positive reviews.  However, after the 1st bites, we simply could not understand the hype given to Issac Toast except that it is reasonably priced,  We have also tried Sinchang Toast at Busan and it is really worth the wait and money and the food is much nicer than Issac Toast.",
30,Cheap and good for breakfast or snack. But I don?ôt think it?ôs worth for waiting tho especially with freezing cold weather. If there is no queue try it.,
40,I really liked their toast. Tastewise it was between a toast and a burger. But I enjoyed it and would recommend it if you want a quick bite/lunch/breakfast.,
40,"Went there shortly after 7am on a Sat and already a line up there. Waited 20 min on the sidewalk which is very narrow and since it is close to the subway exit, lots of people walked by. This was our first breakfast in Seoul. Ordered two sandwiches and coffee. Coffee is so so in Seoul?ôs standard. The ham and egg sandwiches with their special sauce were good, not sure if because of the weather and we were hungry. They made the sandwiches in front of you. They have pre-fried eggs in a square shape, they just need to heat it up with butter then add cheese and ham on top. Since this is a famous tourist attraction, it is ok to try.",
50,"My family love the toast. Though there was a queue, the order and preparation was pretty fast. My hubby loves the hot chicken toast.",
40,"Queuing in a freezing winter to get this famous toast. The layers of the toast with difference ingredient is well blended together, with the sauce. It's definately worth to try. We ordered ""special ham"" at the price of KRW2,400, which is about USD2.4.",
20,Average food. Poor service. I visited the shop near Ewha Women?ôs College. No que before me but the girl who took my orders is a bit impatient.,
40,"I was told that the shop at exit 5 of Myeongdong Station is typically quite busy, and I should be expecting to queue for 20-30min. But I went 2 times, on different evenings, and there was absolutely no queue.  The toasts were nice! Kids love the ham and cheese, while I liked my bulgogi steak. Prices were very reasonable too.  But I did wish they had some tables, or benches sheltered from the cold. There was a cold snap on the evenings I visited, and the strong gusts of winds felt chilling. It made the experience less enjoyable as we had to gobble the sandwiches down, so that we can return to the warm of malls and subways.  And do note... there aren?ôt any dustbins nearby for your sandwich wrappings and food crumbs.",
50,With the outlet nearest to our hotel being also one of the most popular in Seoul - we were shocked to find a long line by the street even before reaching!  The queue was LONG and the wait amounted to nearly 30 mins before we could lay our hands on our toasts fresh off the grill. Despite their mass production cooking methods and their fast hands - our wait was still too long and the wonderful fragrance did not help as we near the counters.  Ordering their signature toasts - served fresh off the grill and devoured immediately - the experience was DA BOMB as the piping hot toasts during the cold autumn morning sent us to toast heaven!  Cheap menu pricing and savoury food resulted in Isaac Toast being one of the most popular breakfast options for the Koreans and the long queues during peak hours showed.  We purposely checked out the outlet again later in the day and there wasn't a queue so avoid peak breakfast hours should you want to try out their toasts without the accompanying long queue and anticipation.,
40,I enjoy so much having isaac toast in my trip and my favourite one is called Î≥ºÍ≥†Í∏?mvp. That?ôs awesome and it?ôs worth to wait for a long time.,
40,"Day 1, I bought the basic ham and cheese toast and a cup of Americano coffee. It was really yummy. The honey makes it real tasty. Value for money breakfast. The second day, I bought the same toast but it didn't turn out to be as good as Day 1. Kind of disappointed.  The queue is long at times. The first day I was there, I queued for about 20mins. The second day is was there, I waited for less than 5 mins before placing my orders. This shop opens from 7am to 10pm. There's no seats available in the shop, so it is just grab-and-go.",
30,Very common sandwishes. For 1st timer you can try it. Nothing special at all. Price not cheap. But for koreans people is common breakfast.,
50,Super delicious toast. They add honey in it and it makes it super delicious. At first it may seem weird; honey toast? But its super delicious! I had it once at myeongdong and several times near Korea University!,
40,"what seems like a simple recipe/method of preparing toast seems to get done in a delicious way with Isaac.  two ladies service the queue of tourist preparing bread toasted on a bed of butter, slap on eggs, ham, cabbage with a nice tasty sauce, and you get a hearty breakfast.  While i will not have it everyday, it is a very nice welcome change from hotel fare, or Starbucks breakfast.  this will be a store i come to once a week, if i was working out from Seoul.",
50,"This is a must eat in Seoul. Worth the queue & money. Their sandwich is greatly toasted, full of ingredients and one bite of the sandwich you will ask for more. My hubby and me ordered no. 2 & 4 (spicy chicken patty & bulgogi patty). I really regretted not buying extra 1 more hahahaha.",
50,"We ordered 6 , 7, 8 and 9. The number 7 I ate don't have a Chilli hot taste and do not taste that good.The rest 6, 8 and 9 as a Chilli taste which I find taste better. It is not very hot but more like curry powder. The bread is big portion if you are small eater can share if not keep the half to eat later. It is Long queue be it morning or afternoon. Must try.",
50,There are a few Isaac toast outlet. The one at Myeongdong is situated on a heavy traffic road and near to subway exit. Many tourist and their locals would queue for it. The sandwiches are toasted on the spot with generous serving of ingredients. There is this special sauce inside the toast that makes it tasty. Saw 1 outlet with cafe settings but can't remember the exact location. Could be in Hongdae area. Definitely worth to try.,
50,"Surprising delicious! I?ôve never heard of Issac toast but became intrigued when I came upon a picture of its wrapper with a bible verse written on it. Then I read some reviews raving about how good the sandwich was and I knew I had to try it. Got the bulgogi (#7) sandwich and I?ôm glad a tried it! I ate the whole thing and I wasn?ôt even hungry! Something about it?ôs sweet bread, bulgogi patty and crunchy slaw reminded me of a hamburger from the Philippines! Anyway, I definitely recommend trying this place when in Seoul. Cheap and like I said, surprisingly delicious!",
50,"Tasty and filling. If you really want an Isaac but don't want to queue, go to the other Myeongdong location. Not as convenient, it's across the major road, on a small steep side street toward the back of the Hotel Prince, possibly Toegye-ro 20-gil. Very short wait. Can't speak to the quality compared to the main shop, but we were very happy with our sandwiches.",
40,Best toasts and sandwiches in town. Perfect for a break. Perfect for any situation. Go for it if you are around.,
40,"We had early dinner and before going back to the room we needed a snack. We found Isaac just in front of the hotel offering a great variety of freshly prepared toasts. Lots of butter involved ensured a tasty outcome. Nothing for everyday, but as a snack in between sometimes, very good. Try it, you won't regret it.",
40,"it was great as a snack. great taste. and it is a chain small snack store, i went to several stores of its. all good.",
50,"Isaac Toast is a popular snack or quick meal here in Seoul. It serves sandwiches with egg and cabbage and other ingredients/ condiments. You can choose from ham, bacon, chicken, and beef. My personal favourite is the Bulgalbi Toast, paired with Iced Americans. It?ôs tasty, filing, and cheap. Just costs around 6,000 won (SGD 7).",
50,"No need to be queue up since we were there before 9am. Though we already placed our order one by one, the lady just missed one of our order. Nevertheless, the toast was really tasty and it costs less than 3,000won, so worth to try.",
10,"Never in my life I had raised my voice as a consumer before and this store is the first one. Honest review ( apart from the rude service given aside), for teh price od USD3~4, this is too expensive. The toast are normal bread, toasted. A low quality patty that you can easily found in supermarket with a piece of very normal supermarket cheese. So what so nice? They spread a layer of oily sweat sauce on the bread. Making the bread soften very easily. So after 1 to 2 bites, the rest are all messy with a lousy kitchen towel wrapping on it. Happy walking with a sticky dripping oily food on your hand and around your mouth. The service, think they want to speed up the long queue that they rush the order like war is coming. With a face of short tempered explosion coming your way. Repeated my order and yet they still gave me a wrong one and insisting is my fault but proven by the person queuing behind me. Yet they speak in Korean ( I may not know how to speak but I understand very well lorrr) saying is my fault. Will not visit will not recommend. For the price and add on a little bit more, I can get a mozzarella cheese burger in Lotteria that taste nicer than this.",
10,"Was in line in front of and behind Koreans, when I got to the counter I got a disgusted face and she just said ""closed"" and then took the next person, it is what it is. Could of course have just been the one person, food did look good though.",
50,"Isaac Toast offers a variety of toasts, ranging from ham and cheese to bulgogi filling, and is surely well known among tourists. We went to the Myeongdong branch at 10am in the morning and waited for 20 minutes in the queue. Were the toasts worth the wait? I would say yes. As all of the toasts are freshly made, the toasts were simply delicious! Even the most simple ham and cheese toast was simply scrumptious. If you don't mind the wait, do pay Isaac Toast a visit.",
40,A must try if you are in Korea. Very flavorful sandwiches. Taste of Korea. Good fastfood place for breakfast.,
30,"Rather overrated as there are sooooo much more delicious food in Korea. It's decent but not a must eat for sure. You can also find something similar from street vendors around that area at half the price. Tried #3 and was rather sweet. If you want saltier, go basic ham & cheese.",
50,"There are many branches of Isaac Toast around Seoul, we went to one at Muakjae stn, walking straight from exit 3. The bulgogi sandwich was good and filling, at 3,000won. There was a drizzle of honey too which is optional. The sandwich was really warm and the toast was crispy.  Will be good if there was a list of outlets in English though. Many of the outlets close early on Sundays.",
50,"Expect to queue! though the queue can be long, it is fast! Service is fast and hassle-free. Not much variety but what is on offer taste great! Must-try!",
50,Superb breakfast for a really reasonable price! Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area. Enjoy :),
40,"We waited for 20 minutes to get our sandwich. It is ordered to make - everything is hot and in good tastes. We had spicy chicken, pork chop and beef that went with eggs, cheese and vegi. We enjoyed eating them standing beside the road... nice experience to go with this super popular street easy food, with a cup of good enough coffee. ?í‰∫Ü‰∫åÂçÅ?ÜÈêò?çÂêÉ?∞Êàë?ëÁöÑ‰∏âÊòéÊ≤ªÔΩûËæ£Âë≥?û„ÄÅÁâõ?âÂíåË±¨Êéí?âÂ§æ?ã„ÄÅËµ∑?∏Âíå?¨ËèúÔºåÂ??ÉÁöÑ?æÂÅö?©È§êÔºõÊàë?ëÁ´ô?®Ë∑Ø?äÂæàÂø´ÁöÑ?ÉÂÆå‰∫ÜÈÄôÂÄãË∂Ö?±È??ÑË∑Ø?äÁ∞°??èàÂ•ΩÂêÉ?ÑÈ£ü?©Ôºå?ÑÊúâ‰∏Ä??∏ç??öÑ?ñÂï°??
50,Don't tell people you have been to Seoul if you haven't try Isaac Toast... This is heavenly-good! On the first mouthful and we knew what was different about it! You must try out Isaac Toast if you are ever in Korea - whether it be for breakfast"," lunch or as a morning or afternoon snack. You definitely won't regret it!"""
50,"Very accommodating to special orders as I had a baby girl with me, could order plain toast bread with cheese. Nice breakfast choice around",
40,"This fast-food chain has many outlets across Seoul. The toasts are more like burgers with different stuffing, like pork, beef, chicken etc. They cook the food right after you place the order. It attracts both local people and tourists queueing up for the food.  This outlet is near Myeongdong Metro Station (exit 5). It opens early. I tried once when I was heading to meet up my local tour guide near Shinshegae Department Store at 8:00 am. It took me 10 mins in total to queue, place order and pick up the food. I tried tteokgalbi (spicy pork) which was quite juicy and delicious.  It is worth trying this fast-food chain, as a breakfast.",
30,"After passing multiple Isaac toast locations through Seoul, all with lines 20+ people deep, our anticipation grew daily. We stumbled upon one during down time and were stoked. 1x bulgogi special 1x bacon, cheese, egg, cabbage 1x strawberry shake.  In Korea you'll notice they like a lot of things sweet, my breakfast sammy had a generous spread of sweet ketchup. It was buttery, hot, and a good mix of flavors + the cabbage crunch. But it really was nothing special. I wouldn't cue up for longer than 5 mins for this place, so many other delectable options for the same price . Worth trying if you are into hype.",
50,Is it possible for everyone of you to stop promoting this establishment! The queue is getting ridiculous.,
50,"I'm so happy to have stumbled upon this gem! We didn't know there was one near Ewha - we were actually looking for another place but couldn't find it. The food was so yummy and affordable. I got the shrimp toast and the strawberry drink. However, the kiwi drink tastes better in my opinion. Try it out! The place was small, but you can sit and eat. I'm not sure how big it is in other locations though.",
40,Had the bulgogi and ham special. Ham special was cheapest. Delicious and packed in a paper wrapper hence why they don't want to cut the toast.,
40,I've tried their bulgogi sandwich it's really good. A lot of people are falling in line just to have a taste of this sandwich and it's really worth a try. The bread that they are using has a distinct taste of honey in it. Yummy!,
40,"Issac Toast is a popular breakfast shop in myeongdong. You can easily have a good breakfast at less than KRW4000. The taste is nice, but not that surprisingly good. There's always a long queue in Issac Toast but it's still worthy. I've ordered Ice Americano and Ham Special Sandwich. Both are good. The cons is there's no table and chair for you to sit in the shop to enjoy the breakfast. You can only take away the food and enjoy it somewhere else.",
40,Completely agree with the concept and menu has to offer mixing Korean flavors presented in two pieces of thick toast. I'm guessing the owners didn't realize they would be so busy. The store itself is tiny and 4 people work simultaneously to make the sandwich you order. Recommend to also try the kiwi and strawberry juices.,
40,"The toasted sandwiches were really good. I especially liked their number 2 which was a pork patty one, and it cost only 2800 won. They also offer fruit juices to accompany the sandwiches. Together, the sandwich and juice make for a very decent breakfast and at a comparatively cheap price. I would definitely queue again for another sandwich when I'm back in Seoul. The queue can be long but it moves fast as the staff are very efficient",
30,"variable of choice, nothing special but with very long queue. But still a good choice for breakfast if your trying to get some hot freshly made sandwishes.",
10,"What i saw first at this shop was a note from shop owner saying that ""we do not half-cut your sandwiches"". It seems so rude,unkind and i felt that the owner does not have a service mind to customers.",
50,"It's a mainstream sandwich place and they have branches everywhere. I actually went to the one in Hongdae (multiple times) where they had a seating area. The sandwiches are awesome. Super simple, but tastes so good. It was just perfect for breakfast and I wanted to come here everyday.  Try their Ham and Cheese or Bacon and Cheese.",
50,"I've heard of Issac Toast and I've tried to temper my expectations, but the sandwiches here are really that good. I would say that the combination of sweetness and how the sandwich is grilled makes it very different from something I usually get in Canada. You should go at least once.",
50,"Since many people were talking about Isaac's Toast, we wanted to try it. Was just about 10min walk from where the Nine Tree Hotel.  Went there the first day but the Q was very long so we skipped. I went earlier before 9.00am the next day. Bought 4 toasts. Must say everyone of us loved the toasts and would recommend it.  Service was efficient and turn around time was just about 10min.",
50,This is the second time I ate isaac's toast. It's really very delicious. I tried ham toast and beef steak toast. Both are nice! Love it! Definitely one of the must eat place in Seoul,
40,"Good sandwich and value for money Could improve by frying longer in the butter, and cooking the egg a bit less.",
50,From the soft toast to inside ingredients it was perfect combination. I had special ham and BBQ sandwich.,
40,"Glad it was near our hotel, too bad they closed on Sunday, but we got it the next day, long queue but it was very quick. I had bulgogi toast, but it came out like bulgogi patty. Overall it was Ok 8/10 and price a bit expensive..",
30,"When we passed by the first store, it had a long line. We decided to skip until we saw the second store because no line was there. We ordered four different sandwiches for our group. All of them have a lot of greases and sauces. It is better not to finish the bottom portion because it's the most heavy part.",
40,Isaac Toast has alot of outlet in Seoul. I tried the toat in Myeongdong. It taste good but with a little one thing about the sandwich. I ordered the Ham toast. It taste good but there is a bit strong smell of the pork ham. I hope they change the type of ham used. It looks like a simple toast which maybe you can make it yourself. It is the sauce they use which makes the toast sweet. Not bad for lazy people to find breakfast.,
50,"Heard so much about the Isaac toast. Glad it was near our hotel and that it opened early enough at 7am! Although there was a queue, it moved fast and the ladies were very efficient.  I relished every bite of it. It is the perfect breakfast to stay your day right! Super yummy!",
40,Hot breakfast on a cold day was very welcoming. Quick and made to order. Usually it's long wait for it but luckily at 7am it was no queue.,
50,"A shop that sells toast breads accompanied by different items such as chicken, cheese and on. Simple yet delicious. There are many different outlets located around Seoul. Prices are reasonable and prepared on the spot. I have seen a fair mix of locals and tourists queuing for the toast.",
50,Yummy and cheap toasted sandwiches. I love getting the sandwiches from here. Been to Seoul three times and this is my go-to breakfast. Can't beat it. Lovely staff too. Expect a queue. Wait is about 10-15 minutes. Grab yourself a banana milk too. Delicious.,
50,Came to the branch opposite Hongik University in Hongdae for breakfast and ABSOLUTELY LOVE this place. It's rare to find somewhere to eat before 11am in this area so we were lucky to find it and it's worth every Won! The coffee here is also very good. We are looking forward to our next meal here!!,
50,"Never upset me! The sandwich was very good taste! It opens at 7pm and really good for catching my early airport bus! It has 8 types of sandwiches but the last one is the standard ham, cheese and egg one, which is not showing in the menu! I do recommend all! Yummy!!!!",
40,"If you're looking for a yummy and simple breakfast, you may try Isaac toast sandwiches. There's always a long queue there, so you will not miss the place. It's near to Loisir Hotel Myeongdong and closed on Sunday.  I like the classic menu - hamburg steak with egg sandwiches.  It's only for takeaway, and usually you see people eating it right the way.  Price is good and it's very delicious and freshly made for you.",
40,Great breakfast if you need something quick in the morning. Lines tend to get long shortly after they open at 7AM but line moves quickly.,
40,"If you do not like to queue for food, try their other outlets such as ewha woman's uni. The myeongdong outlet always hsve a long queue.. though their service is quite prompt, expect an average of 20mins wait if the queue ends at the entrance of the hotel. Toast does taste quite nice",
50,"Went there yesterday (Sunday), and found that it was closed on every Sunday.  Tried again today, went there at 9am. Already got a long queue and started raining. Waited for about 20 mins, which is worthy. The freshly made toasts are the best option for a quick breakfast.  The staff were friendly and considerate. When it started raining, a staff went out to the store and gave umbrella to customers dun have an umbrella.",
50,"Yes yes and YES some more.  A simple menu with 7 options. We have tried #1 (bulgalbi) which is my personal fav, #2 (bulgogi) second fav, #5 (steak ham special) and #7 (ham special). One and two are definitely the go to orders. They leave you wanting more; a creative mix of east meets west. The toast is lightly buttered, topped with egg, shredded cabbage (which adds a great crunch instead of soggy lettuce), a light slice of cheese and a drizzle of their special sauce. YUM!  The line wasn't incredibly long either times we went. Definitely worth trying if you're in the area. Grab a sandwich or two or three and eat while you explore the wonders of Myeongdong.",
40,Excellent toast and very cool place to go. I went for breakfast in the Hongdae branch and ate a VIP ham steak and cheese. No complaints,
40,"Isaac Toast is a chain all over Korea. I've had it in a few cities in Korea, including Myeong-dong, and enjoy it for a quick and inexpensive meal. They have a selection of egg sandwiches with meat and vegetable combinations and signature sauces that are really tasty.  So long as you are sure you are not getting the spicy sauce, then these are pretty compatible with a western palate. The sandwiches are cheap and hot, perfect for eating a small dinner while walking or a late night snack.",
50,"After reading the reviews, I figured I would give it a try since we were staying at Skypark I. I ordered 2 Bulgogi MVPs, 2 Ham Specials and 2 banana milks for 15,400 krw. It was delicious! The secret sauce really makes it!",
40,"Buy a couple of sandwich to share for a good breakfast, all the sandwiches are prepared upon order. You will be asked to be in the queue and stay out of the narrow pathway and you will have sufficient time to decide your order before reaching your turn. Try it if u like something sweet, the sauce makes wonder to the sandwiches.",
40,"Just look at the queue in the photo. Do I need to say more? Mind you, it's 9am in the morning at -6 degree Celsius temperature! The queue never let up until 11am!  It's easy to order. They have a menu pasted all along the outside of the shop where you queued. They even have a queue controller. Haha. The different types of toast or sets have numbers tag to each one. So even if you can't communicate in Korean, just say the numbers and you get what you want.",
40,"Just right outside my hotel in Seoul (Days Myeondong) have an Issac Toast Store. While it is not fantastic, it is pretty tasty and good for the price (2,200 KRW onwards)  This is a pretty good alternative to hotel breakfast, and pretty filling too. The toast is freshly made, only after you have order. All cooking were done on a hot plate, so you get your toast hot and fresh. Good hot bread in winter is really comforting.",
40,"Went here twice because my kids loved it so much! I think I enjoyed it more because it was a chilly morning. If you like the slight sweetness of bread like the Hawaiian sweet bread, and the crispness from being grilled with butter, this is the perfect place for you. In the morning, this place is so popular, that you end up standing in a long line, approx. 15 minutes before it's your turn to place your order. My mom thought we were crazy to wait so long for a sandwich, but when she took her first bite, she admitted it that it was worth the wait. It's basically a cheap breakfast sandwich, and it's not for the healthy conscious folks. It's definitely worth the wait!",
20,"Stumbled across this place when the queue was short and decided to give it a go. It's basically a spam and salad toasted sandwich with a load of butter. Personally I would not queue up for this, as it really isn't very tasty or good quality in my opinion.",
50,To tourists who visiting Korea soon. Check out this highly raved toast!  I had this toast for my breakfast everyday. I have tried all on the menu (except those contains beef) and repeat again. Everything on the menu was so delish sometimes i eat it for 3 meals. I kid you not. I'd recommend the hot chicken mvp & shrimp mvp. These 2 are my favorites. The filling are generous and the special sauce goes well with the patty.  Total damage within 3000 - 5000 with drinks.  Myeongdong outlet is more popular with tourists. While the other outlet at hongdae has more locals and students from Hongik Uni. And dine in available.,
50,This one is a must eat. I came here 2 times and always have to queue but it worthy and so delicious. Next time will go to eat again.,
40,"Good for Breakfast, right in front of Days Hotel, Myeongdong. Always have waiting line but not took you so long",
50,"It was opposite my hotel, New Oriental Hotel, and it is always having a long queue. We tried it on our last day and found out that the menu they had was interesting and new. Beef and Chicken menu. We walked down the myeong-dong street with it!",
50,"I found this Issaac Toast at Singil Station I would like to try it because I like Jo Jung Suk hahaha!!!(even i am not hungry) . I ordered set A and taste is very delicious i like sweet bread and reasonable price(4,400won/set)",
40,"Definitely a touristy spot. There was a line at 9am when we walked by and decided to get one and try it out. It is tasty, but any breakfast sandwich would be heavenly if you soak the bread in butter!!",
40,We tried the Isaac Toast in Hongdae during the cold night and it was a nice experience. A hot toast for the cold night was definitely icing on the cake.,
30,"This place is a joke, and it's not even funny. If it was just there, no queue, no popularity, or no high ratings, then I won't complain. However, you tell me this place makes a great sandwich, and then you give me McDonald quality sandwich is an indirect insult to my sandwich appetite.  There is no sandwich in the world that can make up for the amount of fat used here. There are as many butter molecules as there are sandwich molecules.  Is this sandwich edible? Yes. It's even a decent sandwich. As much as McChicken is a decent sandwich. One might even argue McChicken is a nice sandwich too. But the fact that this place is a well-known sandwich place hurts my brain. I mean, it's a 2 star sandwich place IMHO, but I'm gonna give it 3 stars because they make good kiwi juice. I'm just being kind.",
50,"It is located opposite of the hotel that we stayed. Everyday, a long queue can be spotted.  I tried the ham and cheese, so yummy! Soft bread, brushed with butter and served piping hot! And the price is so much cheaper than those fast-food chains.  Definitely have to try this if the queue is not too long!",
30,"Our hotel receptionist recommended this spot for breakfast after we tried other Korean breakfast spots. The restaurant is a spot on the main street where people line outside (there are no tables or indoor service for this place) to wait and pay and receive the sandwiches. It was somewhat cold when we arrived at around 8:30 AM in a morning. A line of approximately 10-15 people had already formed and by the time we got our sandwiches in around 15 minutes, it was approximately 30 people in line. There aren't any real places for you to sit and eat your sandwiches around this place, so beware! You may want to bring the sandwiches back to your hotel to consume or eat on the run.  The sandwiches are made in front of you (we noticed a lot of oil being used) and they do have a nice smell. We ordered a ham/cheese one as well as a sausage one along with a coffee and fruit drink concoction combos. The sandwiches were definitely nothing special. It was decent, but not really much of a step above a Sausage McMuffin with Egg. The sandwiches were hot but oily, with plenty of egg and sugar. It wasn't necessarily the cheapest eats as well, though it wasn't expensive either. If your hotel is close to this place, then it may be worth it to go but it certainly isn't worth a long detour to come here for breakfast.",
40,"The toast is good despite the fact it's too greasy. The only problem is you have to line up for more than 30 mins, at least, to get one toast during the peak hour.",
40,"This is one of the breakfast you can get early in the morning as most of the restaurants open at 11am. The toast is made upon order so it is fresh and hot but you have to wait for your turn. The price is fairly cheap around 2,500-3,000 won you can get a delicious and full meal in the morning.",
50,The toast are awesome! Went at 10am and had to wait 20 mins for the toast. It's a small take-away counter with no seats. Plenty of tourists too. Saw another outlet at Hongdae with no Q in the evening. So perhaps toast for dinner instead of breakfast? Regardless you need to try it at least once!,
30,"Just right outside our hotel, Days Hotel. Every single morning, we were curious what makes it long a long line. Perhaps this must be famous, delicious sandwich shop in Myeongdong. My friend and I watched and saw how it was made, its freshly made, yes. But it's little greasy. They put generous butter on your toast. Nothing really special on taste, just those ignorant curiosity tourist went to line up and followed by another tourist. If you want a really good sandwich, please go to Hobong Toast, 13 Myeongdong 9-Gil. They have healthy nice version of sandwich plus a fresh blend of variety fruit drinks. If you want to eat there, they have few chairs and a tray to put on your lap. So lovely, I highly recommend it!!",
50,"One of the plus point of this is that the food is done on the spot so what you will get is fresh, piping hot toast on the go. I had the bulgogi toast and I loved the sauce in it. There's always a long queue, especially in the morning but service was very fast.",
40,"It was so surprise that this local sandwiches shop is so good. All day queue up to at least 20 people from early morning right after they are opened till 11 ish they can reach to at least 40 people queuing on the street just to buy a sandwich, so you can image....",
30,"This is really greasy food street food. Most of it isn't homemade and the ingredients aren't of the highest quality. They do have an excellent dressing though, that they are very famous for. I guess this would be excellent if you are hung over.",
40,"Came across this place by chance as I walked around the Myeondong area. It's just a little shop that serves take away sandwiches only. Since the queue wasn't that long and I wasn't in the mood for more kimchi, gogigui and haejangguk, I tried their Bulgogi sandwich. It was the tastiest sandwich I've had in a while. Loved it so much I went back to the stall a few days later for more.",
30,"Well as I situated my exploration in seoul heavily in Myeongdong, isaac toast is one of the popular breakfast corner.. It serves decent toast packed with cabbage, egg, toasted bread, and your choice of main (ham, bacon, steak etc..) I tried the bacon and steak (they give me wrong order of ham).. I was still trying to console myself that they have toasted my steak so long that it compresses it to a ham size hahaha.. oh well.. the queue here takes about 10mins and they dont serve coffee except americano.. but they provide fruit juices.. the toast is ok, can eat as not that much option for breakfast too..",
30,"read great reviews about isaac toast from other bloggers and websites.  went there around 8-am, so line was not too long, just a group of 6 people from hong kong infront of me.  ordered 3 sandwiches. ham and cheese, bacon best and bulgalbi mvp. brought it back to the hotel (tmark grand hotel myeongdong, great hotel) can't wait to try them. really excited to try.  but if u read the title, you know how it went... meh!  i was not impressed. seriously, i've had better sandwich at starbucks.  they used tons of butter, using that brick of butter and just liberally apply it on the pan (look at my pic) also they have this sweet ""marinade"" that they brush over the bread.  all three sandwiches were way too sweet for my liking. the sandwiches have this egg patty in the middle, which is a nice touch as i like eggs. but all the ingredients, the ham, cheese, bacon are over-powered by the sweetness. which is a shame as this could have been a great sandwich shop.  so nope, would not return.  and you should try it only if the line is not very long.",
40,"We went here for breakfast one morning. It's easy to find as there is a line in front of it. They have about 8 different kinds of sandwiches. All of them are the same base: toast, cabbage, pickles, cheese, egg and whatever meat you choose. They are very tasty and filling. It's an easy way to pick something up and eat on the way to the day's destination. They have a sign with pictures on it to point to for ordering but pretty sure they understood English. I would recommend this place on your trip to Seoul.",
40,"Good taste, The toast is very tasty, and it always get a long queue all the time. But luckily it is close to our hotel.",
40,Delicious sandwiches that you can grab and go. But keep in mind you still have to wait in line for 10-15 mins due to popularity! They close on Sunday!,
40,"Had to queue for 20 minutes at 8am. Had the ham special and bulgabi sandwiches. Not bad, worth a try.",
40,Nice. Try the beef sandwich. Nicely toasted n lots of butter. Might have to wait a bit but it's worth it. It's near exit 6 of myeongdong.,
40,"It's quite famous among the blogger suggestion, not bad to try, my favorite is chicken sandwich. But for me myself I prefer Ewha Uni.brunch.",
40,Understand from my fiancee that this place served really good toast so we went to check it out during our trip. We queued for around half an hour and we ordered the chicken and the ham toast. They are nice but a bit too sweet probably due to the honey they spread on the bread.  I noticed almost all the customers in the queue are tourists so I guess perhaps they are famous among the tourists but not the locals.,
40,Went there because I am familiar with the franchise. For me it is a very cheap food and delicious. However like some people already pointed out it is a bit sweet. And if you are not a big fan of this sweetification then this might not be for you.  My favorite here is the Ham and cheese sandwich.  + Cheap a lot of bang for your buck! + Delicious - A bit dirty (that is however how it is with a lot of smaller places) - A bit too sweet,
40,"We ordered 3 type of toasts: Bulgogi, Bacon and Spicy Chicken. Long queue, took us almost 30mins waiting in the rain. It has to be good..... gotta to be really good, if there is a long queue everyday. It wasn't that bad after all, but I personally find it a bit too sweet. I saw them slapping a slob of thick, golden liquid onto the toast. And I reckon it was honey/syrup with butter. That may be the reason why the toasts were so sweet. We had the toasts at 1030, and by 1700 hours, we were still not hungry. Some ingredients in the toast had filled and stayed in our tummy, even after a long walk to burn off the calories. Priced from ??000-8000 per selection.",
40,"Just like many Koreans, I bought this as breakfast. Not a very long queue, wait for about 10 mins. Better read the menu while waiting in queue, since the staff was in quick action and you need to order asap. Time is money. And only take away, no seats are available. Though I am not sure if other brances have seats. The size, compare with normal sandwich, is very large. The ingredients is rich and the toast is crispy. However, the sauce is too sweet for me. And as breakfast, that's too heavy for me. But the price is inexpensive. Suggest two person to share one toast and with coffee, unless you plan not to have your lunch! P.S. Macau now also have Isaac Toast now. Try it and tastes the same!",
50,"I ordered bacon best sandwich for breakfast. It was 2400 krw. It tasted really good. Apart from sandwich, they also have hamburgers.",
40,"Issac Toast is a name I was very familiar with before coming to Korea. I was always hearing about Issac Toast in Korean dramas, and even some variety shows would talk about these cute little toast shops that served quick breakfast sandwiches in Seoul. I headed over to this one and ordered the Bulgogi Toast. I instantly loved it, though it is a bit heavy to eat for breakfast. Also, I had been craving something remotely near American breakfast as well, so it satisfied that craving and at less than $4 USD per sandwich, I am happy enough to recommend this to anyone who has a craving for something a little different than the typically Korean breakfast of leftovers.",
30,"Just for takeout. You'll see the long queue when you get there. We waited about 40 minutes, nothing bad to say about the taste but it doesn't worth it. I find its ranking a little bit overrated and wonder why people are waiting for a normal toast for that long time.",
50,"This is not a drill. I repeat this is not a drill. Issac toast in myeongdong is the best place to eat in the world. I have visited so many times and it is 100% life changing. If you love a beautiful, well thoughtful sandwich or toasted sandwich then this place will blow your mind. A grilled sandwich of sorts - with a hint of Korean. If you only do one thing in Seoul, this is what you must do. The sauce, the fillings - out of the world. Grilled in butter. DELICIOUS.",
30,"Overall, it was a little underwhelming considering previous rave reviews and its popularity. We ordered the bulgogi mvp; it contained the egg omelette, shredded cabbage, sauce, beef patty and cheese. The taste is overwhelmed by both the sweetness of the bread, sauces and the sweet spread they put on the toast. Everything is fried/grilled in copious amounts of butter so its quite greasy, and the toast therefore is a bit soggy and not crispy like you'd hope. However, the price isn't bad for a quick breakfast and you get what you pay for. We waited for about 10 minutes despite there being barely a queue, but that's likely because they were fulfilling a lot of takeaway orders at the time. Okay to have if you're closely and needing a quick breakfast, but definitely not worth seeking out.",
20,"I went to the Myeongdong branch, waited almost 30 mins on line, what a huge disappointment. Ordered the Kalbi, got a flavorless processed meat like patty instead (see photos).  Sandwich drenched in overly sweet type sauce  Yes, they toast/cook it up fresh, however, the ingredients are not, processed ham, processed cheese, meat like patties that don't taste at all like the menu description. Cooked everything including toast in butter.  Only saving grace is their juices are flavorful & fresh, I ordered the Kiwi juice.  It was worth a try but I'll save my money for other breakfast/snack options",
40,"The Isaac toast is really near the Myeongdong Grand Hotel that we have lived in. The toast was really fresh and the food provided was really good. Although lots of people were queuing up to buy, the service was quick enough so they can deliver all toasts quickly. The toast was worth the price and it isn't expensive.",
40,"Happy staff, provide hot home-made food on 7 x 24 basis. Simple food, toast with beef or ham, serve with egg. Nice good.",
30,"I got the bulgogi MVP and the kiwi juice for my lunch. I could only take a few bites of the sandwich before I got sick of it (had to throw more than 3/4 away); the sandwich was too sweet and not as satisfying as it sounded, BUT the kiwi juice was sooo delicious. I've gone back like 3 times just to get the kiwi juice after my first encounter. The juice is both sweet and sour and doesn't taste artificial. It is very refreshing!!",
30,"due to the very good reviews among bloggers or traveller in Hong Kong and Taiwan, we tried the one in hongdae university during our trip and its full of HK, China and Taiwan tourists, only very few local. the toast taste not bad indeed, and there are quite a lot of favour to choose from but it's not as good as I expected.",
30,"perhaps the rave reviews created the high expectations. the sandwich is not bad, quick bite but not something I would queue for. myeongdong branch is super crowded so i would suggest trying the other branches instead.",
30,Nothing korean about it but its good to have it as a quick snack. Was delicious and she makes it right in front of you! Craving it right now! Always a line so prepare to wait. i recommend the special ham and cheese,
30,"I tried ham and my friend tried beef sandwich, of course, beef is more expensive than ham, so the taste is totally difference, the taste of beef is much better and more juicy. I don't like they pre-cooked the egg and not freshly cook it, it made me feel disappointed. No need to take time to find it, but if this shop just nearby you, it's no harm to try.",
50,Loved the egg-soaked crispy toast with yummy fillings. Fresh juice was great too. You just have to bear with the insanely long queue!,
40,"The toast here is famous among the locals, and it's pretty good, but it's on a higher scale considering the options around. If you have yet to try, it's good to have one of your breakfast experience at this chain.",
30,"This chain does not serve bad food. But it's not great. I mean, sandwiches are equivalent to college students eating pizza; it's cheap and almost everywhere. HOWEVER. There are many many little trucks scattered throughout the city that are run by grandmas who sell these for a better price. And they're tastier. You can definitely taste the difference. Eat at those places instead!",
30,"We came here because it was recommended by a lot of blogger. Every morning you will see a long line waiting for food here so one day we decided to queue up also. We waited for about 20 minutes before we can made our order. The staff speaks very limited English so ordering food was quite difficult. Basically we ordered according to picture only. There were probably about 10 choices only, and quite expensive. After taking order and paid, we have to wait for our toast. There were no place to sit, so after we took our toast, we have to eat at road side. The toast is tasty but nothing great. Overrated I think.",
30,"This is made with bread, eggs, vegetables and pretty much sugar. I think this is not good food if you have Korean Foods in travel. This doesn't worth it. Because you can find a lot of foods in Myung-Dong.",
50,"Isaac toast Myeongdong is located within walking distance from Days Hotel Myeongdong and exit 5 from Myeongdong station. Avoid breakfast and working hours (7-10am) as there will be long queue for their toast. However, their toast is really good! Try their Bulgalbi toast (Item number 1 on their menu)! It was soooo goood that my brother and I ate a second time before leaving Seoul.",
40,"If you come to seoul, you have to try this toast. They have many branch in seoul, only small food stall, its like take away junk food, all of the toast is delicious. And the ajumma can speak little english. Very helpful.",
40,"Lines were very long in the morning so be prepared to go early. Waited about 15-20 minutes in Spring and unfortunately there's nowhere to sit after you get your food. The bread was perfectly toasted and crisp yet soft, smeared with a touch of honey and butter. The bulgogi beef was well marinated and went well with the cheese and veggies. Add a hot americano and there's no better breakfast.",
30,I wanted to try this place as it seemed sort of a Seoul institution and I like restaurants/vendors with a bit of a backstory.  I got there around late lunch time and was lucky that there was not a queue as I heard queue times can be quite long.  I opted for the bacon special and enjoyed the process of it being made.  The food itself is ok. The 'toast' is more like very lightly fried bread. I'm not sure what they cook this in but the general taste was a bit too sweet for my liking.  Having said that I'm glad I tried it and for around 3USD I guess I can't complain too much!,
30,"we eat here before flight to USA, we have group of 11 and we like food after coming to US this food similiar to food in US we like this cusine and maybe try again when want USA good food.",
50,Yummy cheap sandwich. I was drawn to this store because of the aroma! The ahjummas were friendly too!,
50,It is really a long queue and you may need to wait 30 - 60 mins as it is all freshly made. It is amazing especially for ham and cheese. Butter make the sandwich so sweet.,
30,"Queued up for about 20 minutes at around 10am on a Sat.  We have heard about ppl raving about these toast so figured we must try.  It was ok, but a bit on the sweet side for my liking, I'm used to the old traditional savoury European sandwich or panini.  If the queue isn't too long then definitely give it a try.",
40,"I tried the classic one with ham and melted cheese, the bread were soft though taste good......can have a try but worth to go under planned. Just nothing really special....I saw a lot of travel side recommended it which I think is a bit over rated",
40,A very tasty toast with various types to choose from just like ordering burgers. A long queue is often seen during the peak meal times and so I went twice in between mealtimes to get my fix.  Definitely worth a try if you're in the area.,
40,Heard of many reviews and recommendations for this toast. Have to admit it when i saw their menu its mouthwatering. I tried bulgogi which i think its the best i had among bacon and chicken..Chocken being the most expensve but the sauce is not on par with bulgogi sweet n smoky taste.Yummy!,
50,Î©îÎâ¥ ??Î®πÏñ¥Î¥êÎèÑ ??ÎßõÏûà?? ??Í∞ÄÍ≤©ÏúºÎ°????¥ÏÉÅ??Î∞îÎûÑ ?òÍ? ?ÜÏùå. ÏµúÍ≥†! Ive tried every single toast they have. All so good and its sooo cheap to be this good. the best!,
40,"We went at 8-ish and were lucky and was second in Q before a long Q starts behind us. My husband wanted to add ham to his order and due to miscommunication with the staff, it became 5 toasts for 4 of us. Nevertheless the toasts are good and we whopped it down in no time. We went to the cafe just 5 steps away from Isaac for coffee after we finished our toast (no outside food for the cafe). It was a great start to our morning. I believe children would love it too. Isaac is only for takeway there is no dine-in.",
50,"Once you try Isaac sandwiches you can not forget it, the best sandwich in Korea. We still think about it. Do not leave Seoul if you have not try it.",
40,"Recommended by tripadvisor so had to try it. We arrived at 9AM and there was a line already. Luckily the line wasn't So long but w a temperature of -6C, the food better be good. Me and my wife split a sandwich which consist of a spicy burger patty, American processed cheddar, pickle, cabbage and a spicy BBQ sauce and buttered toast. It was actually pretty tasty. I Wouldn't say it's a must try but when your in the area... Do try it!",
40,Yummy Issac toast!! Which you'll need to line up for one! It's juicy in the middle crispy outside the toast! Definitely need to try when you're in Seoul!,
40,"Always got a queue outside the store during the breakfast hours, the sandwich doesn't look fancy, but it does taste pretty good with the vegi, meet, salad sauce and butter (alot of it). It is 24 hours place, I can imagine it will be good even after a long night drink - comfort food.",
50,"Issac is well known for its great toasted sandwiches with various fillings, all made on the spot so that it is warm and fresh, esp great on a cold winter morning. If you stay close by, it's easy to hop out to get some back to the hotel room. We had the bulgolgi MVP and it tasted great.  Their serving system works well and efficiently. Give your order and pay. They will cook and assemble your sandwiches within 1-2 minutes. This makes the queue move quickly, which is good since the pavement is quite narrow and it's on the main road.  Heart-attack food - so don't have it every day but you must try it at least once !",
40,"I had the bulgogi mvp which was deliciously tasty, after queuing for 15 minutes. There are no seats so be prepared to eat by the road. Great for breakfast!",
40,"Korean Toast to go. Line is always there. Freshly made, nice hot toast .. Especially YUM during winter. Easily ordered with menu in English.",
50,"If you are in Myeongdong, dont forget this. When u see lines are buiding up just for sandwiches, it have to be good. Is easily located, near Myeoungdong subway station. Same row with Gong Cha. Its nice, fresh and fast to prepare too.",
50,"Every time I visit Seoul I have to visit Isaac Toast and I am never disappointed. The mix of savory and sweet is so incredible and the people behind the grill are so accommodating. The hardest part is deciding what you want on your toast. Make sure you get all the toppings, though. It's a delicious meal on the go.",
50,Best experience for toasts....was wondering how it can be so good....watch them preparing and you will know. Can't leave Seoul without eating 1 or 2 toast.,
40,"This Isaac Toast is just next to our hotel ""Days Hotel Myeongdong"". It always long queue in the morning, close before 10pm. Taste really good.",
40,"yeah it ticks all the boxes for fat, oil, salt and sugar but boy it's tasty. go the big daddy meat cheese and egg for 2800 won if you dare. I'll be back tomorrow.",
50,Went there for a late brekky/lunch. Was good. Recommended the ham special. Didnt have to wait long and was easy to find,
50,Freshly made. A lot choices. Generally the taste is quite sweet but I really like it. Recommended to the people without hotel breakfast.,
50,"We were staying just down the street at the Loisir Hotel. Unfortunately, the hotel restaurant was closed for renovations. We stumbled upon Isaac Toast at 6:30AM on our first morning in Seoul and we returned every day thereafter (except Sunday b/c it was closed). It is such an odd concept: a little sandwich with eggs, corn, pickles and cabbage (and your choice of meat, honey and butter), cooked in front of you on a piece of tin-foil on top of a grill from a window facing the street, but it was delish!  I am a super-picky eater, and, although the two women there every day did not speak English, I was able to communicate exactly what I wanted (no butter, no meat, no honey, extra eggs, extra pickles) and they showed me a price on a calculator that I then paid every day. By the end of the week, they knew my order and it felt like we were friends: both would smile and wave as soon as I approached the window and then would begin preparing our sandwiches.  This is a franchised restaurant, one of many locations throughout Seoul (we tried two). There are tons of choices printed on the board, but you can modify to your preference. Although I wasn't able to order egg whites b/c the little egg and corn squares at this Myeongdong location were premade, some locations crack and cook your eggs while you wait, and have seating.  At this location, there is no seating -- it?ôs grab-and-go -- but it?ôs really inexpensive and there are plenty of places nearby to sit and munch. Enjoy!",
50,so simple. so easy. so cheap. so awesome! truly the best darn sandwich i've ever had. Had it for 3 days straight.,
40,It became popular in Korea... maybe 10-15yrs ago. You can find it anywhere in Korea. But it might be the easy one to find for foreigners. There are so many street food in Myeongdong area. But this might be the most sanitary one there. It was very popular for students who doesn't have enough money when I was younger. But it is still popular for young students because of the price and sweetness. Very reasonable price and good to have for simply getting rid of your hunger in myeongdong. I usually have it when I go shopping there. Right next to Ediya coffee shop which is also most popular coffee chain in Korea. (But it doesn't mean they serve you good coffee. ;-) ) Go get this with milk not coffee they have in the store. Based on a firm related to Christian church as you can get it from the name.,
40,OMG!!! The sandwich tastes amazingly awesome powsome. It ranges from the simplest ham and cheese to bulgogi beef etc. The sandwich here definitely worth it,
40,"Tried this for breakfast and it tasted surprisingly good, perhaps due to the sauces used. It is a great meal on the go as there are no seats for you to enjoy your sandwich with. Nevertheless it is a good match with a cup of coffee which you can get separately from other cafes nearby.",
50,MUST TRY! It's the most awesome sandwich I've ever eaten. They have outlets in different places. I've also tried the one in Hongdae. And the price is also reasonably cheap! (:,
40,"Based on the good reviews from the bloggers, we decided to tried this and we were glad that we tried the yummy sandwiches. There is always a long queue of this shop but it is worthy too spend some times for waiting. Please note that this shop does not open on Sunday!",
50,"read recommendation from internat, realised this is the best value quick meal in Myeongdong! they have lots of branches, so no worry, you will easily find it! the toast sandwiches made fresh by order! it was so delicious and is inexpensive! I ordered beef with BBQ sauce (Bulgogi) sandwiches.",
50,"I don't know how they do it, their sandwiches are savory and yet sweet at the same time. I have been missing it since I returned home. Try their bagels which is equally good. A definite must try!",
50,"If you are in the Myeong-Dong area of Seoul and don't fancy the U.S. $60 breakfast at your hotel, then this is the place for you. The queue is there for good reason. Isaac serves up super tasty, super cheap (starting at KRW2800) local toasted sandwiches. I tried the bulgogi which comes with cheese, egg and a sweet sauce. There seem to be plenty of other options and this looks like a place popular with the locals. Get there early.",
40,We came here for breakfast thrice as near our hotel. Just wanted something light ; so we find this place & food very suitable.  The toast is nice and we tried different types each time. This is definitely much better than the cold sandwich we got on the first morning from 7 Eleven. At least it tasted fresh & warm. Especially in the cold morning.  Unlike 7 Eleven's. It tasted yuks!!,
30,"I guess its to each his/her own. Reading reviews here are quiet mixed and i guess it depends on the individual. I was kinda disappointed. I agree with someone who said that the ham was sweet. Not my kind of thing. As someone also said, quite good for some vegetarians or health buffs out there. But i guess its just me. I don't really like eating veggies for breakfast. Fruits possible, but not vegetables. I'm also a heavy breakfast person but what disappointed me was that the menu was not complete. The bacon muffin was not on their menu. I showed to the lady the website menu on my cellphone but said something in korean and pointed at the menu on the table. I guess for people on the go, this is ok. But for breakfast people like, this place seems to lack the energy food i need to start my day.",
50,"The tiny stall has more than 20 toast selections! For vegetarians, you can opt for cheese & vegetables or cheese & potato toast!",
30,Something nice and value for money. Good for breakfast and comfort food on the go. Plenty of selections.,
40,lots of butter to cook ~ its very tasty but to heavy for a starter in the morning. the staffs are nice.,
40,"I had the bulgogimvp and its good, i liked it. But I find it over rated by other reviewers. The sandwich is made in front of you so you know its fresh. I will eat here again.",
50,"The perfect start to a day. Be quick in the queue because there will be a lot of people waiting for their toast and a photo with their toast, even a selfie!  Toast is delicious and a cheap alternative for a great meal. Around 8 different toast items on the menu. It really doesn't matter which one you get, they're all delicious. Get them all.",
30,"I have always wondered why there is a long queue at this store outside my hotel. Finally. I braved the cold and waited for 20 min for their breakfast.  After tasting it, I still wondered why there is a long queue.  The sandwich is average. Something I am capable of making at home. Probably the cold weather made a hot sandwich extra tasty, I'm not sure.",
40,"Issacs is a takeaway, made-to-order sandwich kiosk located a few steps to the right of the newly opened Days Hotel on Toegyero, the busy road that separates the Myeongdong shopping district from the base of Namsan. The ajumas running the kiosk do wonders with plain squares of white sandwich bread, working deftly to turn them into French toast with cheese, omelette, coleslaw and the type of meat selected by the customers. The humble sandwich kiosk offers an impressive range of meat fillings from popular favorites like bacon, turkey and ham to bulgogi pork patties, hamburgers and steak. There was no queue when we passed by around midday, and our freshly prepared, piping hot sandwiches were ready within five minutes of placing our orders. The ajumas are very generous with the coleslaw and cheese. My chicken sandwich was tasty and juicy, with melted cheese and honey mustard sauce oozing out when I bit into it. The bulgogi pork sandwich that my friend ordered was not bad too, though the bulgogi flavour was rather mild.  Issacs is a nice place to grab a takeaway sandwich if your hotel room rate excludes breakfast. We saw several twentyish ladies from the office buildings on Toegyero dropping by the kiosk to pick up sandwiches for their lunch as well. Issac has a modest selection of hot beverages and fruit juices as well, but we decided to order our drinks from one of the many caf√©s along the same stretch so that we may tuck into our sandwiches while being seated.",
40,"we went back second day after had their toast. its so nice! It locate at many places, our first try was at myeongdong, next day we went to ehwa uni. n we ound it by accident, we did saw another one in hongik's corner just opposite hongik uni. Although there was a queue but it didn't take long, less than 10mins. It was quite oily, but it taste so delicious with the butter n toast. they used they own bread if I'm not wrong. They mixed sweet corn with egg to make the fried egg taste good. Overall its a good try if u wan to have a quick bite or a snack during ur shopping, it is a good choice.",
30,"Heard and see review about this toast and tried. it kinda of sweet rather than those savory stuffs we usually eat for toast. 2,700won for the most simplest toast that consist of Ham, eggs, vegetables. Tasty but sweet though. Address: Myeongdong Station (Line 4) exit 5, walk straight for est 50m and you should be able to see it.",
20,I didn't like the bread in the breakfast menu. Tried the bacon and ham sandwich. Eggs are sweet which tasted weird.,
50,Great recommendation. Had the bulgogi mvp n it was tasty n toasty (pun intended). Excellent to grab a bite n walk to the sub station to start our touristy visits for the day. No queue at 930am for me,
50,The q may be long but we get served very quickly! The sandwiches are delicious. A lot of love has been put in to make these slightly sweet sandwiches!,
50,"Very like this sandwich which is done by them. the price also very cheap, can fulfill all customer request.",
50,"A great option for a hearty breakfast! They offer very yummy sandwiches and shakes. The one we had have cheeze, juicy burger patties and scrambled eggs!",
40,"Tasty sandwiches which is good for morning breakkie, they have so much types & varieties that even beats Subway sandwiches",
40,What a great breakfast sandwich to start your day at Seoul. Very tasty and quick if you in a rush to start your shopping day or tour at Seoul.,
50,"I don't normally eat sandwiches, but their sandwiches are wicked good. And they make it fast and fresh, right off the grill.",
50,"we saw this shop at the road side with long queue. we passed by it morning, the queue was there and same goes in the evening. we decided to try it out, the sandwich is awesome. there are no table nor seating. you just order and pick up when its ready.  there have few flavors to choose from. we tasted 3 flavors and all are yummy. we're sure going back to this shop when we visit Seoul in future.",
40,Great place for a quick bite. Around KRW2700-3200 depends on what you order. No table nor seating. We ordee two sandwich and had to fibd other place to eat during raining as more customer queuing up at the stall,
40,"The store can be easily located at the main road in Myeong-dong with nice variety of sandwiches to chose from, which is quite tasty. However I noticed they use pre-made egg omelettes which they just re-heat before use. That is different from what I read from the blogs' recommendation.",
50,"Worth it a try. We had it as our breakfast. It's so nice that they have menu which is written in mandarin which is easier for me and my friends to order. Anyway, one of the toast in the menu has increased the price but it was not mentioned in the menu. We only find out when we were paying. However, I think it worth every penny. Super nice toast and it's a really big portion for a petite girl like me.  We went at a right timing because there was no other customers. But right after us, people starts to queue for order. I wished that they would have a space for people to ""dine-in"". They only have like a very very small space which can accommodate 4-5 people. There were 6 of us and we were sitting next to each other, shoulder to shoulder.",
40,"Run by a lovely elderly couple. Couldn't read the menu, so I just pointed. Nice warm sandwiches for breakfast on a cold winter morning.",
50,"Isaac is the most famous sandwiches store, over 1000 stores in Korea. I love Korean meat patty with Korean sweet ketchup.",
40,"This is a food stall on a main road a minute walk from Myeongdong subway station exit 5. It serves a variety of made-to-order toasts. They are essentially sandwiches made with French toasts in placed of regular bread. I ordered the beef MVP toast and was not disappointed. The beef patty is juicy and the toast crispy. The touch of shredded cabbage and onion added to the flavour. The stall has limited indoor seats with most of its customers ordering take-away or eating just outside the stall. A wonderful treat/ snack, especially on a cold winter morning.",
40,"Decided to get one of these toasts things while I was out seeing the city. It was very interesting, but also very good. The one I got had ham, egg, cheese, ketchup, and mustard. The flavors mixed to create a sweet then sour taste. Would get again!",
40,Beacon and cheese sandwich is the best! The price is reasonable and they have English menu provided.,
50,"Take Exit No.5 at the Myeoung Dong Station, walk 50 m and you see the red sign of the famous Korean sandwiches chain Isaac toast (see photo). Isaac toast is a chain of fast food breakfast, which does delicious toasted sandwiches. It is famous among Seoul tourist because it is probably one of the best options for breakfast in a town (or country) which usually has not much to offer for breakfast for the tourists. The chain has become famous and even opened some stores in USA. The toast are delicately roasted with a bit of butter, giving them a delicous taste. Inside, there is egg, vegetable, cheese and meat (e.g. bacon, bulgogi, pork or chicken). What makes it special are the sweet, spicy korean sauces they add. If you are in Seoul, you should try it at least one day. A sandwhich cost between 4000 to 5000 won. They have the menu in English and Chinese.  And if you become addicted (like we) and do not want to miss it when you visit the other Seoul and Korean sights, you can even check out their website (http://www.isaac-toast.co.kr/) if there is a store near your next location. Unfortunately, as it is in Korean, it takes some time, a lot of copy&paste, Google translate and Google maps to get the closest store. I found another store at Dangdaemun and at Isadong, both close to the subway.",
