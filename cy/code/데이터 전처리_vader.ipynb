Great place to have relax.', '  On this hot summer day, I wonder how many more comfortable places to rest in Seoul as the Han River. The valley is nice, but access is not easy. Yeouido Hangang Park is located right in front of Yeouinaru Station on Subway Line 5. It is also possible to visit by car, but despite the large parking lot, it is not recommended because of the large number of people. Since most people come to Yeouido Hangang Park for the purpose of chimaek, public transportation is recommended. It is embarrassing to write down the messengers that everyone knows too well, but It is recommended that you come empty-handed, borrow a mat and table, get chicken delivered, purchase alcoholic beverages other than beer at convenience stores, and purchase additional food at Han River Park stalls to have fun and then return home empty-handed.  ah!!
