3,mel7155,4.0,"Great place to shop for cosmetics, fun socks, hair products and even Korean fashion . Yes many shops have closed but it is slowly being revived .  What was interesting was trying the various type of street food along this area - who does not love eating skewered meats as you stroll along the streets or try Dalgona candy or eat fried chicken and beer and thereafter try your hand on Myeongdong ice cream , dumplings etc….  Business is slowly being revived here . Good to come down and support the local businesses .","Written June 23, 2022"

7,Traveller of the world,4.0,"I wrote a review but editing it as I am still in Seoul and my review has changed slightly. I expected a lot more looking at photographs pre-pandemic. Seoul has only just reopened to the world. It is busy and things are open but it's not as I would have imagined. The shopping is pretty average with some local shops plus high street names like Zara. There are some food stalls (more on the weekends) where you can get street food. Having said the above, each day it is getting busier and more things are opening slowly. Weekends are when things are really busy. I expected things to open a lot later but most things start to close by 22:00.","Written June 4, 2022"

9,Hannah,5.0,"Myeongdong is a must-visit when touring Korea. With products ranging from tornado potato chips to designer shoes, Myeongdong boasts everything in Korean cosmetics, food, toys and fashion. Its perfect location (centered in Seoul) allows such resources. The busy hustle of food carts on every street will ensure that you have a delightful time : you simply cannot not ignore the famous elderly woman sitting by the entrance stirring up dalgonas to spice up your visit. Although overcrowded at times, such chaos is what makes Myeongdong the perfect place to take a dive into Korean culture and socialize. Visiting in the morning may also help: Myeongdong is relatively peaceful earlier in the day, although there may be less food vendors.","Written December 10, 2021"

If you are looking for korean cosmetics, K-pop merchandise, clothes, accessories - Go to myeongdong. Everything from underground shopping to high end stores, you will spend your money. It is interesting to see one cosmetic brand having many outlets in parallel streets. Interesting to see free samples given to women at cosmetic store to lure in them and make them buy products. Street food is very delicious, quick and you can definitely make a hearty meal out of them. You can also see students involved in volunteering work, old people protesting sale of dog meat and preaching about believing in Christianity, large tour groups hurrying up to finish their shopping et al.  Whatever it is, Myeongdong is a fun place to go and spend the afternoon or evening.","Written August 21, 2020"

On the first night we thought it was a novelty but we quickly realised that some of the food wasn't as cheap as we thought. Some of them vendors reheat food by using those gas flame lighters so they're not fresh off the grill or reheated on it. As well as it being unbelievably busy, there was rubbish everywhere, it was a bit of a turn off. Worth a visit if you're into k-beauty though but wouldn't come here just for the food stalls.

Some restaurants have a 2nd or 3rd floor, so do go in and check with host/hostess for availability, and don't just assume there's no seating when the main floor is full. There are lots of street vendors along Myeongdong-Ro (St) where they sell gimbaps, deep fried squids, etc...which you may fancy. For tourists, you will find good exchange rates in this area too.

74,minnesotans4,4.0,"We were in Seoul overnight and wanted to shop for their wonderful Korean beauty products. We stayed at a hotel near Incheon and debated whether to take the AREX Incheon Airport Express train from the airport or uber. The one way train ticket was definitely cheaper at 9,000 South Korean won compared to the $75 USD uber but we opted for the uber due to time constraints. Taking the shuttle back to the airport, finding the express train, and coordinating the train schedule plus a transfer to Myeongdong Street from Seoul Station seemed too much of a hassle and time consuming. Travel time was between 45-60 minutes. Be prepared for the crowds since this was one of the main shopping/tourist streets. The stores accept credit cards but have SK won for the street vendors. We found ATMs in the area. We tried some of the street food but after awhile tired of the greasy fried food. There were some rather unique concoctions: fish shaped waffles, dumplings with red bean paste, and seasoned chicken/rice cakes to name a few. We were there for the beauty products and found Innisfree to have the best selections. We loved: Jeju orchid enriched cream, green tea seed serum, green tea seed eye cream, volcanic pore clay masks, wrinkle cream and of course the masks. The jellyfish vital mask was one of my favorites. Credit cards were accepted plus duty free was an option with a passport. These products can be ordered online but was cheaper in the stores. What was interesting about this area was that there were literally no garbage cans to throw away wrappers etc. from the street food. Fun experience and felt very safe in the area.","Written January 6, 2020"

There is so much here for everyone, in terms of beauty, music, niknaks, food etc. I would 100% recommend going here at night for the market, it is a once in a lifetime experience. The two best things I found in Myeongdong were - Nanta Theatre and Underground shopping centre.  The Nanta theatre was absolutely hilarious and can be loved by people of all ages. The underground shopping centre - found when going into the myeongdong subway station, was okay, there wasnt much there other than niknaks and socks, but there are a few kpop album shops there with such a large range of albums, all for very cheap. I'm from the UK and albums here (mainly bought through amazon) cost 4/5 times more than what I found here. I spent over £1000 on albums whilst here, and actually got my moneys worth, wheras in the UK this would have gotten me 30 albums at the most.","Written December 31, 2019"

The price can be diference betwen 3000 idr per item. Its all up to your decision.  I think 2.5 hours is not enough for first shopper like me. In the winter session, (-3 C) you must wear appropiate custom, since this is an outside area. And do not take more than 15 minute in the outside. visit a shop every 15 minute is the best to maintain your stamina.  There are alot of the same shop, so be careful if you make an appointment. be more specific on the location.  Take Care and have Fun.. happy shopping...

The shell was huge but contained very little meat, swimming in cheese. I felt I was eating cheese alone.  The cheese hotdog was nice but you need to ignore the colour of oil used to fry it.

About 3 blocks square, the food stalls congregate along one strip and it is on this strip that we spent most of our time as we are foodies. From live octopus to egg cake, fruit smoothies to scallops in large seashells, the choices are endless and a veritable taste sensation. Prices are reasonable to a tad pricey for what you get but where else can you have so much selection in such a condensed space.  We also had a Korean massage for a reasonable price but it is a dry massage through towels and a hospital-like gown; more of a pressure point session than a true massage... a bit of a disappointment.  The stores offer packaged almonds, dragon's beard candy, ice cream, face and beauty products, and numerous tourist trinkets. But really, it is all the neon and energy and liveliness in the crowds that make this place work. An hour will do or stay the whole evening; it's totally up to you.

First off, I loved the vibe of the neighborhood, despite how crowded it became every night. That said, the neighborhood actually is not that big - two main thoroughfares, primarily, each maybe 4-5 blocks long. Lots of side streets with other shops and food options, but the main action really is on the thoroughfares. Lots of cosmetic shops, lots of cheap clothing of the Forever 21 quality level.  The street food was very much hit or miss, nothing completely mind blowing. Lots of repeat stands, but note that not all the stands have the same quality. I tried to use the length of the lines for each as a rough gauge on how good the stand may be - also a hit or miss approach.  Two tips and heads up (literally): - there are a lot of hidden eateries, cafes, and shops in all the buildings above ground level. really pay attention and look up to see what you may be missing out on! I found a few cafes that I loved - grab a coffee and a window seat and you can people watch all the action down below for awhile - garbage cans are really hard to come by. stay with the vendor you purchase food from and chuck your garbage with them after you're done, or come prepared","Written October 20, 2019"

The place to head to is Myeongdong district which contains a grid of streets brimming with shops selling beauty products. Seriously, I was in heaven.  I also found that if you spend over £30,000 won most of the shops would immediately deduct the tax free amount so no need to claim it separately. Take your passport with you.

There are also many shops, especially beauty shops (as in all cities in Korea), even if they all sell the same things, less or more. Here you can buy sweaters or t-shirts at a cheap price!

323,britron,5.0,"We were told that we could get a fast and simple meal from the street food trucks in the Myeongdong area...and mainly that it was SAFE to do so. The streets were mobbed with people of all ages, and the food options ranged from grilled lobster to things I couldn’t pronounce. We opted for the grilled shrimp, fried chicken, and some fruit. Not so easy to eat standing up and being jostled by the crowd, but it was worth the experience, which was so fun!","Written September 1, 2019"

I note there are plenty of places to eat together with plenty of small independent shops. For me it was people watching.  I found a place for lunch and it was packed. Aircon was a plus and wifi.  A great place to wonder around.","Written August 23, 2019"
330,Winston Chuah,4.0,"There's no doubt that Myeongdong has been so developed that it feels touristic and commercialized. Lots of visitors from all countries at any time of the day. Most interesting things to do here is to:  1. Shop 2. Shop some more 3. Shop till you drop  From cosmetics, Korean groceries, apparels, shoes, etc - you're bound to find something that would interest you. Along the way, there are some pretty good cafe and restaurants. For first timer's to Seoul, I'd recommend staying around this area.","Written August 22, 2019"

336,APB_SFO,1.0,"Avoid this place - full of garbage trying to get tourists to buy beauty products. It is the same 5 stores repeated over and over again, all selling these packages of ""sheet masks"" for your face or your feet. They have ""foreigners only"" discounts, and try to give you a free sheet mask in an effort to draw you into their store (and if you walk 50 m there will be the exact same store with the exact same crap).  If you're afraid to adventure out in Seoul and need to have a meal with the tacky tourist board and translations, then you should enjoy this street a lot.","Written August 16, 2019"

343,mr_kr3,4.0,"Lots to see and do, jam packed with shops selling facial products and clothes, lined with street stalls selling local fare. Full of life, definitely worth a visit (even if you don’t shop like me) to soak up the local culture.","Written August 11, 2019"
344,milcah889,4.0,"I’m not fond of crowds and crazy shoppers; so Myeongdong’s beauty shopping mecca doesn’t really spell paradise for me. The only thing that draws me back would be its hardworking purveyors who spend their nights feeding hungry bellies, no matter the weather.  It’s important to note that Myeongdong’s street food are darn expensive. It’s something that definitely won’t fall under cheap eats; as you’ll usually be able to eat a hearty meal in a sit-down restaurant for the price of one or two of these street food finds.  There will never be a shortage of options in Myeongdong Night Market. The tricky part is though is how to strategize what to choose, given that you usually have to allot for queuing time and work with a limited budget and stomach. The Roast Lobster with Cheese (KRW 15000), for example, is an insanely indulgent treat, which serves grilled juicy lobster topped with a fluffy melted cheese blanket. It’s delicious, but it definitely won’t fill you up.  Baked seafood served with hot gooey melted cheese seems to be a popular trend (given that we arrived at the tail-end of its winter season), as kiosks of Cheese Butter Baked Scallops also drew in their own lines. The scallops were humongous; but tended to be overcooked.  The Shrimp King’s Grilled Shrimp (KRW6000) may be an uninspired choice compared to its flashier neighbors; but its perfectly cooked juicy shrimps were addicting. Its sweetness guarantees the freshness of the shrimps and makes them perfectly delicious to eat on their own. They do give you a variety of sauces and dips to play around with though!","Written August 11, 2019"
345,Just 1 More,4.0,Great place just to wonder around and get lost while shopping. These streets are lined with many shops and cafes. Don't go too early as a lot of places don't open until afternoon.

If you aren’t into kpop the street itself has all the best clothes shops, skincare and other little stalls dotted around from etude house to forever 21.

349,Abdul Hadi,4.0,It'll take hours if one were to stop at every stall. The varieties of things sold ...very eye-catching. Tried quite a number of types of food. The lobster with cheese...very delicious but priced a bit stiff at ₩16 per piece. The Taiyaki there is different from the soft ones normally eaten. Its...crispy/flaky. There are quite a few stalls with the 'Halal' logo but some are like photocopied( not original). So not sure if its authentic. Surprising that quite a number of the stallholders can speak good Malay! Impressive indeed.,"Written August 9, 2019"
