10,Culinary-Consultants,2.0,"I agree with most that the architectural display out side the Starfield COEX Mall is impressive to say the least. But inside? That's another story. Low ceilings, very dole and depressive. We felt as encased for a lack of better words.  It does not represent inside the modernistic approach from the outside. The quality of the stores are really average and we believed that a structure of this kind would have design better stores and with better choices. Most things once again, cheap Chinese stuff, disposable value items and again the infantile South Koreans with stores filled with teddy bears (for adult people) cute cartoon printed made in China socks (for adults) and the distribution of the stores....very confusing.  Not a well planned mall and nothing to offer except for the Starfield Library, which is really pretty and impressive. Two floors library with lots of colors and places to eat. Basically the only highlight of the Starfield COEX Mall which is pretty average.  Except for the Starfield Library which you can access directly from the streets, the rest of the mall is a waste of pure time. Not recommended.","Written January 29, 2020"

So big that it has two different KTX stops that bring you to its front doors.  It's more of an upscale mall with a great variety of popular Korean and foreign brands (Uniqlo, Roots, and some European designers are all I remember off the top of my head) as well as smaller boutique stores. Also being in a very developed area of Gangnam as well as being a destination in its own right, everything is a little bit more expensive here, especially compared to many of the other underground malls that have more stalls than built-out stores.  The food selection has a wide variety of prices and offerings so you'll find something you like for sure. The Seoul Aquarium and a movie theater are also in the mall if you're not much of the shopping type.  All in all, covering the whole mall would take about an hour of non-stop walking. While stopping in a few shops here and there, you can get through it in 2-3 hours. If you're like my girlfriend, well, you can spend the whole day here pretty easily.

We checked in our luggage, got our seating assignment and boarding passes, then, went upstairs next to the Airport Limo Bus waiting area in a section called ""Arrivals"". There were lockers to rent for about $3 -$4 US for 6 hours. We stored our hand carry luggage there. My husband is interested in tea, and lucky for him, there was a huge Tea Exhibit in one of the conference halls. We spent several hours there admiring exquisite displays of tea cups, ceramics and tea pots that were impressive! Some of the artists were there serving tea in their bowls. There was a plethora of teas and everything related to tea. We saw a tea ceremony performance and talked to so many people. When you're there, check out what conferences and exhibits are held--you may be lucky like us! We left because I was starving! There were so many restaurants to choose from in the mall. We saw an eyeglass shop and had heard that eyeglasses were reasonable in Korea, so, we checked it out and got some spiffy glasses as our souvenir! They were professional there, checking our eyes against our prescriptions and I was glad that we went there rather than a shop on the streets. The mall kept going on and on with an Aquarium, movie theatres, shopping, shopping and more shopping. We had planned to walk across the street to Bongeusa Temple for tea, but, we were tea'd out after that fabulous Tea Exhibit. We found our way back to our lockers using the well-marked signage, then, bought the Airport Limo Bus ticket (about $17 US each).

The first day I was overwhelmed with the commercialism, but then as the week wore on, the COEX mall became a friend providing warmth, sustinence and entertainment for me as a solo business traveler in a strange land.  HOLLYS COFFEE: Can't find it on the map, but it's worth a visit. I have never before had a Dutch Baby at a restaurant (they're a family favorite to make at a shindig) and it was good (not great). The coffee was very good, better to my palate than Star*ucks).  I also ate at Kervan one night, sushi for lunch, found some skin products at one store, and found groceries to stash in my hotel room at the Hyundai basement store.  The entertainment was watching the very young, very hip K-POP population meandering the mall in massive crowds at all times of day and night.  The surrounding area is not bad to walk, and had some nice sculptures. Quite urban, noisy, not really pedestrian-fun, but not unfriendly to walkers either.","Written May 3, 2015"

There are many retail shops; restaurants and cafes are plentiful too, but they don't come cheap, so be prepared to spend.  I was here during early spring when it can still be quite freezing at times, so shopping underground, staying indoor worked well for me.

253,ÎèôÌòÑÏ†ï,5.0,"Hello everyone,  I always use this application, when I go abroad,  so I guess you'll see my review, before you come to Samgsung road.  Actually I'm Korean, and I live in the Samsung road(10 minutes by walk from COEX.)  My grade for Coex is 5stars, because there are many wonderful restaurants, and shops, and etc.  But not now.  From 2013, Coex mall is on a remodelling, so if you come here, you can use just 2 services.  First one is a mega box theater, and 2nd one is a aquarium.  I think, It's a terrible season for you to come here.  For me, I live in here so I go there to see a moive, but you don't have to see the movie here in Korea.  Instead of Coex mall,  I recommand you some sites.  1st one is Í≤ΩÎ≥µÍ∂Å., which is a royal palace of CHOSUN dynasty.  You can see the Korean traditonal structures, and traditional clothes of royal family.  2nd is Insa-dong, where you can drink Korean-tea, and see the gallery.  3rd one is ÎèôÎåÄÎ¨∏ ÏãúÏû•, which is an cheap market for clothes, and sports equipments.  4th is Î™ÖÎèô, the downtown of Seoul.  You can see the cathedral, and korean traditional market, and may complex marts.  I think, You can shop here, instead of Coex.  5th is Ïù¥ÌÉúÏõê, this is a road for foreigners. You can go by the subway line no.6, so It's very easy to find it.  There are may restaurants of western foods, and pub& clubs are in Ïù¥ÌÉúÏõê.  So I reccomend you to go there in the night.  Next is ÏÇºÏ≤≠Îèô.  It's a little bit expensive, but there are may beautiful cafes, and delicious Korean restuarants.  My last reccomendation is Ïó¨ÏùòÎèÑ.  It's a little island, in the Han-river, and in Ïó¨ÏùòÎèÑ, there is a nice river side park.  You can jog along the river.(Beer & Chicken will be a perfect selection. You can odrer by phone at the park.)  And for the restuarant,  I'll say just one thing.  Please stop by the ÌåîÏÉâÏÇºÍ≤πÏÇ¥, in Ïã†Ï¥å(sinchon).  It's very popular Korean pork bbq restuarant, and so many Japanese love this restaurant.  I believe that you'll be satisfied.  That's all.  I post this review,  just because I see so many foriegners in the Coex these days,  and everyone was dissapointed.  So I can tell you, not to come Coex, until 2014.(The remodelling""ll be finished on 2014.)  Thank you.","Written January 19, 2014"

Also located in this complex are the Intercontinental Hotel and the Park Hyatt Hotel. The mall has stores for all tastes from economical to luxury. There are a huge amount of restaurants from Western to Asian, and an Aquarium and the Kimchi Museum. The layout of the mall is relaxed with plenty of space and although there may be many people there, it never feels crowded. A worthwhile visit especially on a rainy day when you need something to do. It also has a 16 screen cinema.","Written November 26, 2012"

We did not dare to venture away from the subway direction since we nearly got lost.  Noted that there are no proper shops nor sections of a department store that sell toys. Even if we find one, the selection is ""private limited"". Wonders what the Korean kids grow up with....iPad? Samsung tablet?","Written October 20, 2012"

287,retiredhaha,4.0,"We went to the COEX mall via#2 subway line from Lotte World Hotel; three stops and only cost 3300 Won/$3 USD roundtrip for each person. Plenty of stores in this underground shopping mall, and we had lunch at one of Japanese restaurants. Weekdays would be the best time to go; less crowded and decent price for food. The mall opened at 1030 hrs, some stores did not open until 1100 hrs. I forgot the name of the coffee shop (Beans and something) located in the mall; the establishment has an enclosed area for smokers,pretty cool with automatic door (similar to the smoking room at Incheon airport). Overall, we like the COEX, more shops and cheaper than Lotte Dept Store or Lotte Mart.","Written October 12, 2012"
288,Melwsy,4.0,"Its a super big mall and one can easily get lost in it. Good thing is that there's a lot of shops. But because of the big mall's layout, you tend to have to walk a lot to get from one place to another. Can get quite tiring. There's quite a number of eateries in it. In case you're craving for your usual fast food, this is definitely where you can get them. Some off the top of my head are Macdonalds and KFC. You can get almost anything in this mall, ranging from duty free shops, clothes, stationery, shoes, and so on. It's definitely worth a visit if you have some spare time and would like to do a little shopping and explore this vast mall.","Written August 22, 2012"
289,Inshil K,4.0,"If you have only a few days to stay in Seoul and would like to see different part of it (from places like Namdaemoon or Myungdong), Coex mall is the place to go. Located in the middle of one of the most expensive land of Seoul, everything is expected to be a bit more pricey. Nevertheless, you can shop, eat, sight-see all in the underground mall! You may notice that the crowd is younger, more-hip, and maybe even richer. Good place to people-watch! ;-)","Written August 14, 2012"

291,BluebirdieCA,5.0,"I was wondering where all the Seoul people go on a Sunday until I entered the COEX mall in Gangnam. On a raining Sunday, the COEX mall was filled with people. There are upscale department store right along side with all kinds of boutique stores, as well as theaters in the mall. The COEX mall is connected to the Samseong metro station. You can find digital map at the mall entrances as well as along the mall. Remember to select the language you desire in order to read the map. The information desk and small stand along a few corners also have map in Japanese, Chinese, and English.  There are a few run of the mill restaurants in the COEX mall, as well as a few very elegent ones, all depends on ones mood. But be forewarned, if you go to COEX on a weekend or holiday, be prepared for long lines at any restaurant. I saw many locals grabbed a bite and the 7-11 inside the mall because the restaurants are too crowded.  The mall is very clean despite heavy traffic. Skip the kimchi museum because no one goes there (admission fee 3000w which is around $3). The food court inside the department store is very popular and worth a try.","Written July 23, 2012"

However, at most times of days there are lots of people, and at dinner one may have to wait 45 minutes for a seat at a restaurant like Mr. Pizza.","Written July 15, 2012"

However, I'm not really excited by the crush of a mega mall experience. To anyone who gets fired up over a frenzy of consumer energy, this is the place. It has a respectable aquarium, an above average number of name brand franchises, a decent food court and a CGV movie theater. It also straddles the Samseong Station on Seoul Metro Line #2.  If you want an injection of weapons grade retail therapy then COEX will do the job. If, on the other hand, you were just trying to meet some friends or grab a couple of items off your shopping list, then you might consider a smaller shopping center.  Note: I went with two children - 3 years and 1 year old respectively. COEX had many ""children friendly"" areas, but the end result was over-stimulation and some seriously cranky kids.","Written January 29, 2012"

As Seoul is party to extreme temperatures in Summer and Winter, this mall makes shopping, dining and getting to and fro as easy as possible.  For the first-timer, it may take an entire day to get used to the mall-but there are a lot of fun distractions to keep one from panicking in confusion.  There are also lockers from place to place in the mall which served me greatly the last time I went over. I don't know how I managed before lockers changed my shopping world forever.","Written January 21, 2012"

Among endless cafes, fashions, Department Stores, souvenirs, we found Jackie Chan's Dim Sum and a multiplex (The Megabox). And if you are considering to stay at one of the hotels (Park Hyatt, the Coex Intercontinental or the Grand Intercontinental) in this area, you will certainly find the City Terminal in the mall particularly handy. (The travel from Incheon International Airport to the Daechi Dong area is a very long distance.) For international travel through Incheon, allow at least three hours before flight time. (We were told by the hotel we need 4 hours. But the Korean Airline desk set the record straight and told us 3 hours is sufficient) Our flight was 10:30am in the morning. We arrived at the city terminal a little after 7 am. Checked in our luggage and got onto an an airport limousine(bus) right away, around 7:15. (For flight to Jeju through Gimpo, allow 2 hours) We found our Korean airport experience much less hectic than the North American equivalent.","Written January 19, 2012"
