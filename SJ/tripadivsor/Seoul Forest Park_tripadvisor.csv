The weather is cool so it is more pleasant to walk around.The forest is easy to reach by the Seoul subway. At the Seoul Forest station, use the lift near Exit 3 to reach the ground level. Turn right and then left into Under Stand Avenue. I spent some hours in the forest, exploring the various parts. From the entrance, I kept to the right of the forest as the trees on that side were particularly colorful.The weather was cold, so the bird corner at the far right was empty. Then I turned back to the rear of the forest where the Ginkgo Road, under the afternoon sun, was absolutely absorbing. From there I passed under two bridges on my right to reach the Deer Corner (with spotted deer). Later I returned to the entrance, passing by the lake. I spent over 4 hours there, totally absorbed by its beauty in autumn. The forest is huge hence it is important to plan your walking route beforehand.","Written November 11, 2018"

We walked through the forest and enjoyed the fall trees, though they were just starting to turn. We really enjoyed feeding the deer. The butterfly house only had one species of butterfly so that was a bit disappointing. The forest is easy to get to using the subway.

There are water features which works on a season with rainfall. The forest also connects to Hangang Park and river view.  Follow the map to enjoy a great stroll. Bundang (yellow) train line.

We spent most of an afternoon here, walking the park and discovering hidden areas (small animal area, deer retreat, children's park, statue park, etc). The cafe overlooking the lake with fountains was peaceful and we happily sat with a drink and ice cream here for over an hour. We found somewhere to rent bikes by the hour (all sizes, and tandems!) for a reasonable price, and although we didn't use the facilities there were tennis and badminton courts.

Directly in front of the exit is a row of green and white bikes which you can rent. You do not need to be a citizen of Korea to use the system, and all of them have baskets and gears.

There's an information centre from where we picked a map. Headed towards the deer park but got distracted by the lovely sakura and the insect house enroute. There's a deer food machine just a wee bit away from the deer park. The deer looked much bigger than expected and be wary of the aggressive ones which are all too happy to grab the paper cup from your hands whilst you are feeding them.  There are different parks within Seoul Forest so we then headed towards the open area where people were sitting on picnic mats and enjoying themselves. There's eateries at a mall near the skating park at Gate 3 so if you haven't bought anything to eat with you, you can head there.

NOTE : when we were there last Dec, there was a major construction going on in the front of the park..

Make sure you have enough time for the nice scenery, playground and to visit the deers.. the deers are at the far end of the park from the Train Station.. so factor in the timing needed to walk there...  There is also a playground in the park where my son had great fun..  All in, this is a very nice place to relax and see some lovely deers..

Perhaps it wasn't the right time of year (I visited in mid-October). It didn't seem that well taken care of. There were some flower beds still in bloom. I didn't think it was particularly that big after being told it would take a 1/2 day to do. Perhaps if you do all the extra stuff such as the butterfly garden and children's activities. I went early in the morning before10am so none of the buildings were open yet. It is easy to find. Take the B (orange line) to the Seoul Forest stop. Follow the signs in the metro for the Seoul Forest exit (Exit 3). When you come up from the metro just walk straight a block and you'll see a giant white sign for Seoul Forest.  If you have free time and want to wonder around a bit outdoors it's not a bad place however don't expect to escape the hustle and bustle noises of Seoul.

There are lots of areas for picnics or just quietly relaxing.","Written February 1, 2014"
149,SGBudgetTraveller,4.0,"I am so glad I found out about Seoul Forest. It's a big place with lots of things to do even in winter. There are 5 different parks. There is an enclosure for deers and they will come to the edge of the fence to eat from your hand. (There is a machine near the enclosure where food for the deer can be purchased.) There is a place where they displayed insects, an echo forest and most important lots of place for the children to run and enjoy the fresh air. As we were there in winter some of their attraction was not open like the splash fountain but my children still had lots of fun building snowman, sledding and having snowball fights. Coming from a tropical urban city, this was definitely one of the highlights of the trip.  The great thing is it is really convenient to get there. Take the subway to Ttukseom station (line 2). Exit via exit 8 and walk about 15 minutes. There are even directions in English. Another great thing - it's free!","Written December 16, 2013"
150,chris a,5.0,"I am amazed that i am the first one to comment on this hidden jewel, yeah maybe its a little far from seoul but it was a perfect place to get away. Ride the yellow line train and its clearly marked to get to the Seoul Forest. The landscaping is really good and there are many things to see and do inside the forest. You can rent a bike, there is a butterfly area where you can actually go inside and the live butterflies are fluttering all around.. its free?? Great place to take pictures, if you are into flowers then you should go during the spring and summer but i prefer the fall when the mosquitoes are under control. There are clear maps to see and there are certain sections of the park labled so you can choose your interest. There is a place that you can buy food to feed the deer.. great chance for kids to see and feed the deer and they are always hungry. There is a bridge section that allows you to walk from the park all the way to the Han River. Its a great place to grab an ice cream and walk around with friends or families. Plan on spending some time just to go to every part of the park and you can even continue on and walk around the Han River. Good place to picnic and take pictures. The best part is... its free??? Enjoy","Written October 1, 2013"
