1,Brian J,5.0,"We walked part of the stream on our way from Changdeokgung Palace to City Hall. As a tourist, not something you’d make a special trip to see but worth walking through if you’re in the area.","Written July 6, 2022"

3,Traveller of the world,5.0,"This was just stunning.  I went at dusk.  Even though it was slightly chilly with light rain, the atmosphere and setting were just magical.  The lights and skyscrapers, the couples sitting by the stream or families and friends catching up, whatever the occasion it was the atmosphere, vibe and setting that just captured my heart.  Loved it.  I took a slow stroll from one end to the other and back.  There are some information boards which are really interesting to read giving you some facts about the stream and the surrounding area.  This is a must for any trip to Seoul.  I was lucky the evening I was there, the sky turned this stunning colour with the dark grey clouds and purple sunset. Suggest going in the early evening. There are a few places nearby to grab a drink or bite to eat after.  ","Written May 30, 2022"

However if you go there during the night, it can be a bit scary as the street light is not much in terms of quantity and brightness. But don't worry as local people here are very nice and friendly.

17,Della G,4.0,"We stumbled onto this stream by chance when we were touring the Myeongdong shopping area. This is a delightful stream that runs about 10 kilometers through pretty much downtown Seoul. I understand that prior to 2005, the stream was polluted. So now this area has been cleaned up and converted into an art and nature walkway. It is a wonderful area to walk along the stream. It is a relaxing stroll, has nice greenery and art work along the way. You can even cross over onto the other side where there are stepping stones. I would say it is a nice area for city workers to have lunch in, great for families and romantic couples alike.","Written January 31, 2020"

22,SiYauKai,3.0,"We stayed in the Myeongdong shopping area, and walking to the stream was only 5-mins away... north of the Line 2 (green) subway station. We went there at night after dinner, and it was very tranquil. There were sections along the stream where you can cross over to the other side via big stones/boulders. If you come in November, there will be the lantern festival going with nice lanterns to see. We didn't get to see this, but it was still a nice walk along this stream, with some artwork along the walls (when you walk under bridges).","Written January 17, 2020"

25,Meander800093,5.0,Went at evening to see the lanterns on the stream. It was breath taking.We took many photos and marvelled at the beauty of the lanterns. It is a lovely walk also in the day time. Great to stop along the walk and find a place for food.,"Written January 8, 2020"
26,Kira Yvonne Lim,4.0,"We took a quick stroll with the kids before sunset, when it gets cold.  The lanterns were not lit up but it was a refreshing quick stroll. I bet it's even lovelier during summer.  One of the more relaxing area in this busy city.","Written January 8, 2020"

People are taking photos along the way and above at street level. Unfortunately some rude Korean speaking ladies ruined the evening as they kept pushing and squeezing towards the railings for their photos while our girls were taking theirs. Could have been a five-star experience.,"Written January 1, 2020"

On the roads either side there are a number of coffee shops, restaurants and other points of interest.","Written December 28, 2019"
32,Andrew,3.0,"I walked almost the complete length and back of the stream. It was winter and during the morning hours so there were few people, no night lighting or street food stalls and alas the plants were not looking their best in the cold. It’s a nice walk, but nothing exceptional. Maybe during spring/summer and at night the place would be more spectacular.","Written December 26, 2019"

37,John A,5.0,"I was lucky enough to walk half length of the stream walk of about 16 points/6km. The waterfall at the start of the adventure led to multiple stepping stone crossings from side to side, abundant fish and bird life as well as beautiful trees. Bridge architecture varies at each station, some of which provide cultural stops to admire under-bridge art galleries, ceramic tile displays of historical events and unobscured views of modern buildings reaching the skies all around. The 13th station led to Gwangjang market, the biggest and oldest example still operating. The night excursion following the stream changes aspect with the addition of myriad illuminations and light displays. Locals and tourists alike enjoy this experience on a daily basis.","Written December 6, 2019"
38,John R,4.0,"It's a cute and artistic way of making an inevitable water course into a nice attraction. Maybe not so much in winter when I was there but probably a nice cooling respite from the high-rise buildings all over Myeongdong especially in summer. I used it as a marker to guide me through that part of the city, it is prominent on any map and helped me find my way.","Written December 6, 2019"
39,ileannkneel,4.0,"I understand this stream is a recent transformation and what a great idea it was. As it is below street level, the noise and din of the great city is greatly diminished and while walking a portion we saw a heron fishing, catching, and eating a meal of fish. Way cool. Very few major world cities have this feature as part of the downtown core. Seoul stands out and gets major points with the addition of this small but natural respite from the craziness all around. 4 stars.","Written December 5, 2019"

46,yipjcs88,4.0,"I went to this place a few times in the past. At night the waterfall was lit up beautifully. On the weekends there were many hawker stalls selling food, etc. This year there was a lantern show and the place was unusually crowded.","Written November 13, 2019"

48,Poshberries,5.0,"Was brought by relatives to visit this beautiful place. Caught by great surprise with the amazing landscape along the stream. We happened to chance upon 2019 Seoul Lantern Festival in Nov. There were so many featured lanterns, each lantern has a story behind it which are very interesting for visitors to enjoy reading them while walking along the river. Took us about 20 to 30 mins as we were enjoying & strolling slowly with a toddler.  And there’s also water laser show around 9pm which drawn a lot of tourists and local visitors too. During one part of the stream, you can opt to place a floating lantern with light costing krw 5000, saw many young couples and families doing this for fun as well as for goodwill blessings.  I think this place is very romantic too as we can take many lovely pics in the evening with all lighted lanterns as backdrop. What’s more fun is you can step on the rocks in the river to cross over the other side. This is something really quite interesting. We walked from Jongno-5-ga all the way Euljiro-1-ga station back to our hotel. Definitely recommended for those first timers and returned visitors. Will be back again next time I visit Seoul again. Thumbs up!!","Written November 4, 2019"
49,ErkiBear,3.0,I thought we would use the stream a lot to get from A to B and avoid the busy streets and traffic but turned out it is just that bot too far south of the main areas to be that useful. Looks pretty though.,"Written November 4, 2019"
50,Jane H,4.0,"We enjoyed walking along the paths by the stream, both in the day and at night. There are lots of interesting features (stepping stones, fountains, artworks, benches with sunshades, etc) that make it a lovely way to get between places or just stroll. It felt very safe at night, and at the western end especially there were lit up fountains & waterfalls, etc. The musical fountain light show was a surprise at 7.30pm & very good.","Written November 1, 2019"
51,Robert J,3.0,"The stream is a good way to travel across the city, away from the heavy traffic and need to wait at pedestrian crossings. At places it is quite colourful and pretty at others it's a bit more neglected. It is a safe way to get around and features labels and access steps to the various roads it passes beneath.","Written November 1, 2019"
52,LCJ330,5.0,"Located in the Centre of the metropolis, the walkway gives a sense of calmness from the fast paced city. No festivities while I was here but I’m sure events would be well decorated.","Written October 31, 2019"
53,MWashatkaphotography,4.0,Such an interesting stream and atmosphere running through the city. Although the stream is in the heart of the city it is such a pleasant place to rest. You will see business people and tourist alike relaxing and enjoying the sounds and sights of nature...taking a break from their day. Love the green umbrella installation and also the spot where you throw the coins in. my kids loves running up and down and crossing over the water on the large rocks.,"Written October 29, 2019"
54,HaikuSy,5.0,"Nice, cool, clear, and clean stream. Families would come with their children or dates. The place is very clean, well-maintained, a lot of small fish, to be enjoyed by all ages.  There was a safety traffic event at the end by the waterfall / filter that we were able to join and enjoy. They say sunsets are nice here; I think so too.  Tents were set-up by the time we left; around 3PM but given a choice, I would have stayed much longer.","Written October 28, 2019"

56,LAUCHEEHONG,3.0,"Was totally blown away with this ""new"" attraction when i chanced upon it 5 years ago. Its still nice, but i suspect the landscaping & other exhibits seems to have suffered from maintenance budget constraints.  I did manage to visit the Cheongyecheon museum. Great place to spend an hour or two. A bit difficult to get to since there's no metro station nearby, but easy enough by taxi or bus. (Get your ""free"" costume picture taken at the photo machine near the entrance door on ground floor. They can even email the picture to you, though for some reason, it does not work for gmail. My friend got his photo on yahoo mail.)","Written October 26, 2019"
57,StrangeTrout,5.0,I walked a number of miles by the side of the stream and it really is a delight. As one is sunk below the road it's very quiet and allows one to take a breath and relax in a city that is constantly loud and moving. Even after dark I wandered here as there are groups sitting and chatting or couples wandering hand-in-hand. Worth a trot along even if briefly just to restore equilibrium,"Written October 23, 2019"
58,Gary W,4.0,"Nice place for an early evening walk. Set beneath street level, so on hot days it remains cool. Well laid out walking paths make it easy to navigate. If you staying in central Seoul worth taking a walk in the evening before or after diner.","Written October 21, 2019"

62,Seow B,5.0,It is a canal walkway below road level with running water in the middle. Pedestrians are evacuated when the water level upstream is too high and needs to be released into the canal thus flooding the canal and the pedestrian path on both sides of the canal. There are plenty of greenery as well as benches and nice theme sections at different sections of the canal. A good relaxation and exercise stretch when in the dongdaemun shopping area. Worth a visit.,"Written October 12, 2019"
63,kinetix,4.0,"Took a walking tour along the Chonggyecheon Stream. A nice peaceful walk starting from Gwanghwamun and ended at Dondaemun.

72,Nicholas D,5.0,"In the middle of the city is the Chenggyecheon stream which is a river pathway that starts from the centre of Seoul and can take you beyond Dongdaemun Market and further east of the city. It is a pathway full of interesting natural and man-made features including many bridges, trees, hedgerows and more. The stream is also full of Art installations which catch the eye and at night time parts of the stream contain light shows that help keep the river area active during the night with revellers, tourists and even locals just looking for an area to relax or exercise. If you have a few hours to spare on your journey I recommend walking this riverpath to a location in the city like Dongdaemun Market or Insadong Shopping area.","Written September 27, 2019"

Who would have thought that this stream was once paved over and was a major road. Its actually really nice and I know it reaches all the way to Dongdaemun. If I had time, I'd walk further and enjoy the diversity and culture. Its a great place yo go at night. Great for social gatherings, dates and running.","Written September 25, 2019"

83,DanSilvestre,5.0,"Cheonggyecheon Stream runs through the heart of the old city of Seoul, running almost East-West between a bit past the East Gate (Dongdaemun) to the West Gate (Soedaemun)...Its western end starts just a short way from the Gyeongbok Palace, while it's eastern end is very near and accessible to the Dongdaemun fashion district with its newest attraction, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, by the late Architect, Zaha Hadid.  The stream itself runs below the level of adjacent streets, so the experience focuses more on the nice landscape and waterscape treatment of the stream itself, which has evolved from being an underground sewer/canal roofed by a highway in the 1960s, until its current reincarnation as an interesting urban design element to modern day Seoul circa 2005...or sometime around then.  A series of pedestrian and vehicular bridges cross over the stream. It's nicely lit at night so even an evening stroll is pleasant. However, during storms or periods of monsoon rains, the stream also functions as flood control infrastructure, so best to check first for warnings or alarms before descending.  The stream is bounded by a variety of facilities, including hotels, restos and bars, as it traverses the Myeongdong, Jongno and Dongdaemun districts, so if your walk makes you hungry or thirsty, just get back up to street level for that snack, meal or drink.","Written September 4, 2019"

During the day it's a great place to take a relaxing break while sightseeing in the downtown area. It's below street level which keeps down the street noise. You almost forget you're in the city. I especially like it after dark. It's a great place to sit and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. It's lit with colored lights and images projected on the walls.

The stream is quite long and has a fair number of visitors but it never feels crowded and you can always find a spot to dip your feet and watch the world go by.  The water is crystal clear and there are areas with fountains that make for a nice view. Towards evening, LED lights come up and make it an enchanting place.  I would highly recommend visiting this venue. It's a lovely way to spend an evening in Seoul and an oasis of calm in a hustling metropolis. I wish more cities took the effort to create public places of this nature.","Written December 30, 2018"

195,Rumples,5.0,"We walked for about 1 mile along this stream, which features a narrow park-like setting on both sides, and found this space to provide a lovely respite from the city’s noise and high-rises. Part of a program to provide green areas in Seoul, the area opened in 2005 after the removal of an elevated highway and roads that hid what was left of a stream below. To keep it running now, water is pumped from elsewhere to maintain a steady flow.  Cheonggye Plaza near Gwanghwamun Square in north-central Seoul marks the starting point, A tall modern sculpture by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggeu signals the plaza. Titled “Spring,” the work displays alternate red and blue spirals and resembles a thin Christmas tree.  We descended steps that lead to a walkway, where the immediate view is a wide waterfall to the right, which plunges into the stream. No vegetation appears in this section, but greenery, including trees, soon comes into view. Footbridges and stepping stones sometimes gave access to the opposite side of the stream. Flowers arranged in boxes and pots on walls brightened the area. Nature kept our attention, and we hardly noticed the tall buildings in adjoining neighborhoods. Only a few people wandered here on this Saturday morning, and we much appreciated the serenity.","Written November 22, 2018"

I was pleasantly surprised that the Cheonggyecheon Stream starts quite close to the City Hall and my hotel. I threw my little rucksack onto my back and proceeded to walk downstream.  I didn’t track how far I walked. It was just nice to relax in the sun, taking it nice and easy and stopping from time to time to take the odd photograph and ogle at the large carp swimming in the water. I liked the stepping stones placed strategically across the stream at numerous places. And underneath the bridges you could sit in the shade, read posters and signs and even enjoy a small art exhibition under one of them.  At one point, way down stream, I climbed the stairs up to normal street level and discovered a large textile market. On the way back I walked at street level just to get the feel of the normal weekday hubbub.  It was certainly an unusual experience to see such a peaceful stream running through the Centre of such a busy city with the normal traffic and hectic life continuing unabated at street level.  Certainly a nice way to spend some down time. And I clocked up many more than my usual daily 10.000 steps making up for sitting around in planes the day before.","Written October 20, 2018"

Lit up at night, the stream has a different ambience again. Stepping stones along some parts of the stream create lots of fun for kids and adults alike to jump from one stone to another. The depth of the stream is not too deep, but keep a watch and hold your kid's hands to prevent an unwanted fall in the water. No cafes so bring your own water to drink.

There was also trinket stalls (different from the usual tourist stuff) - it was bustling with locals (couples on a romantic walk) so the atmosphere was lovely.
